risks relating to the company generally 

cybersecurity data protection and technology risks 

we could incur significant liability or our reputation could be damaged if our information systems are breached or we otherwise fail to protect client or company data or information systems 

in operating our business and providing services and solutions to clients we collect use store transmit and otherwise process certain electronic information including personal confidential proprietary and sensitive data such as information related to financial records health care mergers and acquisitions and personal data of our clients colleagues and vendors we rely on the efficient uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business and securely process transmit and store electronic information in the normal course of business we also share electronic information with our vendors and other third parties this electronic information comprises sensitive and confidential data including information related to financial records health care mergers and acquisitions and clients’ personal data our information technology systems and safety control systems and those of our numerous thirdparty providers as well as the control systems of critical infrastructure they rely on such as power grids are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access damage or interruption from a variety of external threats including cyberattacks computer viruses and other malware ransomware and other types of data and systemsrelated modes of attack our systems are also subject to compromise from internal threats such as improper action by employees vendors and other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems moreover we face the ongoing 

challenge of managing access controls in a complex environment the latency of a compromise is often measured in months but could be years and we may not be able to detect a compromise in a timely manner we could experience significant financial and reputational harm if our information systems are breached sensitive client or company data are compromised surreptitiously modified rendered inaccessible for any period of time or maliciously made public or if we fail to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public or law enforcement agencies following any such event whether due to delayed discovery or a failure to follow existing protocols 

cyberattacks are increasing in frequency and evolving in nature we are at risk of attack by a variety of adversaries including statesponsored organizations organized crime hackers through use of increasingly sophisticated methods of attack including the deployment of artificial intelligence to find and exploit vulnerabilities such as “deep fakes” longterm persistent attacks referred to as advanced persistent threats and the use of the it supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised suppliers accounts or hardware in particular we are at increased risk of a cyberattack when geopolitical tensions are high as diplomatic events and economic policies may trigger espionage or retaliatory cyber incidents 

the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems include among other things computer viruses malicious or destructive code ransomware social engineering attacks including phishing and impersonation hacking and denialofservice attacks because these techniques change frequently and new techniques may not be identified until they are launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures resulting in potential data loss data unavailability data corruption or other damage to information technology systems in addition remote work arrangements in response to covid19 have increased the risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks or unauthorized dissemination of personal confidential proprietary or sensitive data 

as the breadth and complexity of the technologies we use and the software and platforms we develop continue to grow including as a result of the use of mobile devices cloud services open source software social media and the increased reliance on devices connected to the internet known as the internet of things the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks also increases despite ongoing efforts to improve our ability to protect data from compromise we may not be able to protect all of our data across our diverse systems our efforts to improve and protect data from compromise may also identify previously undiscovered instances of security breaches or other cyber incidents our policies employee training including phishing prevention training procedures and technical safeguards may also be insufficient to prevent or detect improper access to confidential personal or proprietary information in addition the competition for talent in the data privacy and cybersecurity space is intense and we may also be unable to hire develop or retain suitable talent capable of adequately detecting mitigating or remediating these risks 

should an attacker gain access to our network using compromised credentials of an authorized user we are at risk that the attacker might successfully leverage that access to compromise additional systems and data certain measures that could increase the security of our systems such as data encryption including encryption of data at rest heightened monitoring and logging scanning for source code errors or deployment of multifactor authentication take significant time and resources to deploy broadly and such measures may not be deployed in a timely manner or be effective against an attack the inability to implement maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our information systems must be continually updated patched and upgraded to protect against known vulnerabilities the volume of new software vulnerabilities has increased markedly as has the criticality of patches and other remedial measures in addition to remediating newly identified vulnerabilities previously identified vulnerabilities must also be continuously addressed accordingly we are at risk that cyberattackers exploit these known vulnerabilities before they have been communicated by vendors or addressed due to the large number and age of the systems and platforms that we operate the increased frequency at which vendors are issuing security patches to their products the need to test patches and in some cases coordinate with clients and vendors before they can be deployed we perpetually face the substantial risk that we cannot deploy patches in a timely manner we are also dependent on third party 

vendors to keep their systems patched and secure in order to protect our data any failure related to these activities could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we have numerous vendors and other third parties who receive personal information from us in connection with the services we offer our clients we also use hundreds of it vendors and software providers to maintain and secure our global information systems infrastructure in addition we have migrated certain data and may increasingly migrate data to the cloud hosted by thirdparty providers some of these vendors and third parties also have direct access to our systems we are at risk of a cyberattack involving a vendor or other third party which could result in a breakdown of such third party’s data protection processes or the cyberattackers gaining access to our infrastructure through a supply chain attack highly publicized data security breaches such as the december 2020 largescale attack on solarwinds that created security vulnerabilities for public and private organizations around the world may embolden malicious actors to target the it supply chain and providers of business software while we do not believe our operations were affected by the solarwinds attack other similar supply chain compromises could have a significant negative impact on our systems and operations 

we have a history of making acquisitions and investments including the acquisition of jlt in 2019 the process of integrating the information systems of any businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk for instance we may not adequately identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities in an acquired entity’s information systems either before or after the acquisition which could affect the value we are able to derive from the acquisition expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to a cyberattack in addition if we discover a historical compromise security breach or other cyber incident related to the target’s information systems following the close of the acquisition we may be liable and exposed to significant costs and other unforeseen liabilities we may also be unable to integrate the systems of the businesses we acquire into our environment in a timely manner which could further increase these risks until such integration takes place 

we have experienced data incidents and cybersecurity breaches such as malware incursions including computer viruses and ransomware vulnerabilities in the software on which we rely users exceeding their data access authorization employee misconduct and incidents resulting from human error such as loss of portable and other data storage devices or misconfiguration of software or hardware resulting in inadvertent exposure of personal sensitive confidential or proprietary information in april 2021 an unauthorized actor leveraged a vulnerability in a third partys software and gained access to a limited set of data in our environment like many companies we are also subject to social engineering attacks such as whatsapp scams and regular phishing email campaigns directed at our employees that can result in malware infections fraud and data loss although these incidents have resulted in data loss and other damages to date they have not had a material adverse effect on our business or operations in the future these types of incidents could result in personal sensitive confidential or proprietary information being lost or stolen surreptitiously modified rendered inaccessible for any period of time or maliciously made public including client employee or company data which could have a material adverse effect on our business in the event of a cyberattack we might have to take our systems offline which could interfere with services to our clients or damage our reputation a cyber attack may also result in systems or data being encrypted or otherwise unavailable due to ransomware or other malware we also may be unable to detect an incident assess its severity or impact or appropriately respond in a timely manner in addition our liability insurance which includes cyber insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches cyberattacks and other related data and system incidents 

the costs to comply with or our failure to comply with us and foreign laws related to privacy data security and data protection such as the eu general data protection regulation gdpr and the california consumer privacy act ccpa could adversely affect our financial condition operating results and our reputation 

improper collection use disclosure cross border transfer and retention of confidential personal or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny legal and financial liability or harm to our reputation in operating our business and providing services and solutions to clients we store and transfer sensitive employee and client data including personal data in and across multiple jurisdictions we collect data from client and individuals located all over the world and leverage systems and teams to process it as a result we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states europe and around the world regarding privacy data protection data security and cybersecurity these laws and regulations are 

continuously evolving and developing some of these laws and regulations are increasing the level of data handling restrictions including rules on data localization all of which could affect our operations and result in regulatory liability and high fines in particular highprofile security breaches at major companies continue to be disclosed regularly which is leading to even greater regulatory scrutiny and fines at the highest levels they have ever been 

the scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting for example the gdpr which became effective in may 2018 greatly increased the european commission’s jurisdictional reach of its laws and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data such as the public disclosure of data breaches privacy impact assessments data portability and the appointment of data protection officers in some cases in the us the ccpa came into effect in january 2019 and introduced several new concepts to local privacy requirements including increased transparency and rights such as access and deletion and an ability to opt out of the “sale” of personal information despite a proliferation of regulatory guidance papers much remains unclear with respect to how to interpret and implement the gdpr and the ccpa and that lack of clarity could result in potential liability for our failure to meet our obligations under the gdpr and the ccpa given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations including classifying data and committing to a range of administrative technical and physical controls to protect data and enable data transfers outside of the eu our compliance with laws such as the gdpr and the ccpa will continue to require time resources and review of the technology and systems we use further the european union court of justices schrems ii decision and brexit have created uncertainty with regard to the future of the flow of personal information between the us and eu and between the united kingdom and the eu and that uncertainty may impair our ability to offer our existing and planned products and services or increase our cost of doing business 

following the implementation of the gdpr other jurisdictions have sought to amend or propose legislation to amend their existing data protection laws to align with the requirements of the gdpr with the aim of obtaining an adequate level of data protection to facilitate the transfer of personal data to most jurisdictions from the eu accordingly the challenges we face in the eu will likely also apply to other jurisdictions that adopt laws similar to the gdpr or regulatory frameworks of equivalent complexity for example brazil has enacted its general data protection law the lei geral de proteção de dados pessoais which came into effect in august 2020 china has enacted the personal information protection law a new comprehensive privacy law india is considering a new privacy law canada is proposing significant changes to its federal privacy law and japan has adopted sweeping changes to its privacy law in some cases including china and india the laws include data localization elements that will require that certain personal data stay within their borders 

in the us following the passage of the ccpa california approved a ballot measure that enacts the california privacy rights act which makes extensive modifications to the ccpa additionally several other states have introduced privacy bills some more comprehensive than or divergent in key respects from the ccpa there is also continued legislative interest in passing a federal privacy law 

in addition to data protection laws countries and states in the us are enacting cybersecurity laws and regulations for example the new york state department of financial services issued in 2017 cybersecurity regulations which imposed an array of detailed security measures on covered entities these requirements were phased in and the last of them came into effect on march 1 2019 a number of states have also adopted laws covering data collected by insurance licensees that include security and breach notification requirements all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time may divert resources from other initiatives and projects and could restrict the way services involving data are offered all of which may adversely affect our results of operations 

many statutory requirements both in the united states and abroad include obligations for companies to notify individuals of security breaches involving certain personal information which could result from breaches experienced by us or our vendors in addition to government regulation privacy advocates and industry groups have and may in the future propose selfregulatory standards from time to time these and other industry standards may legally or contractually apply to us or we may elect to comply with such standards we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws and regulations concerning data 

privacy and security and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws regulations and standards may have on our business 

furthermore enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations including a recent focus on website “cookies” compliance in some countries continue to increase privacy violations including unauthorized use disclosure or transfer of sensitive or confidential client or company data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation by the company our vendors or other parties with whom we do business if they fail to meet the standards we impose could damage our reputation and subject us to significant litigation monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines and criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions given the complexity of operationalizing the various privacy laws such as the gdpr and the ccpa the maturity level of proposed compliance frameworks and the continued lack of clarity on how to implement their requirements we and our clients are at risk of enforcement actions taken by eu and other data protection authorities or litigation from consumer advocacy groups acting on behalf of data subjects we may not be able to respond quickly or effectively to regulatory legislative and other developments and these changes may in turn impair our ability to offer our existing or planned products and services and increase our cost of doing business 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to develop and implement improvements in technology or respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological change 

we depend in large part on our technology systems for conducting business as well as for providing the data and analytics we use to manage our business as a result our business success is dependent on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and on continuing to develop and enhance technology systems that support our business processes and strategic initiatives in a cost and resource efficient manner particularly as our business processes become more digital we have a number of strategic initiatives involving investments in or partnerships with technology companies as part of our growth strategy as well as investments in technology and infrastructure to support our own systems 

these investments may be costly and require significant capital expenditures may not be profitable or may be less profitable than what we have experienced historically in addition investments in technology systems may not deliver the benefits or perform as expected or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected which could result in operational difficulties or additional costs in some cases we also depend on key vendors and partners to provide technology and other support for our strategic initiatives if these vendors or partners fail to perform their obligations or otherwise cease to work with us our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected if we do not keep up with technological changes or execute effectively on our strategic initiatives our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

in addition to remain competitive in many of our business areas we must anticipate and respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological change the threat comes from traditional players such as insurers through disintermediation as well as from new entrants such as technology companies insurtech startup companies and others in the past few years there has been a substantial increase in private equity investments into these insurtech companies these players are focused on using technology and innovation including artificial intelligence ai digital platforms data analytics robotics and blockchain to simplify and improve the client experience increase efficiencies alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the industries in which we operate 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from errors and omissions breach of fiduciary duty and other claims 

our businesses provide numerous professional services including the placement of insurance and the provision of consulting investment advisory investment management and actuarial services to clients around the world as a result the company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of errors and omissions breach of fiduciary duty and similar claims which we refer to collectively as eo claims in our risk and insurance services segment such claims include allegations of damages arising 

from our failure to assess clients’ risks advise clients place coverage or notify insurers of potential claims on behalf of clients in accordance with our obligations to them for example these claims may include allegations related to losses incurred by policyholders arising from the covid19 pandemic or losses from cyberattacks associated with policies where cyber risk was not specifically included or excluded in policies commonly referred to as “silent cyber” in our consulting segment where we increasingly act in a fiduciary capacity through our investments business such claims could include allegations of damages arising from the provision of consulting investments actuarial pension administration and other services we may also be exposed to claims related to assets or solutions offered by the consulting segment in complement to its traditional consulting services these consulting segment services frequently involve complex calculations and other analysis including i making assumptions about and preparing estimates concerning contingent future events ii drafting and interpreting complex documentation governing pension plans iii calculating benefits within complex pension structures iv providing individual financial planning advice including investment advice and advice relating to cashing out of defined benefit pension plans v providing investment advice including guidance on asset allocation and investment strategy and vi managing client assets including the selection of investment managers and implementation of the client’s investment policy we provide these services to a broad client base including clients in the public sector for our investment services matters often relate to services provided by the company dating back many years such claims may subject us to significant liability for monetary damages including punitive and treble damages negative publicity and reputational harm and may divert personnel and management resources we may be unable to effectively limit our potential liability in certain jurisdictions including through insurance or in connection with certain types of claims particularly those concerning claims of a breach of fiduciary duty 

in establishing liabilities for eo claims under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap the company uses case level reviews by inside and outside counsel actuarial analysis by oliver wyman a subsidiary of the company and other methods to estimate potential losses a liability is established when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable the liability is assessed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable given the judgment involved in estimating and establishing liabilities in accordance with us gaap as well as the unpredictability of eo claims and the litigation that can flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations or financial condition 

we cannot guarantee that we are or will be in compliance with all current and potentially applicable us federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states and its various states the united kingdom the european union and its member states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate for example we are subject to regulation by agencies such as the securities and exchange commission finra and state insurance regulators in the united states the fca and the competition and markets authority cma in the united kingdom and the european commission in the european union as further described above under part i item 1  business regulation of this report we are also subject to trade sanctions laws relating to countries such as belarus cuba crimea iran myanmar north korea russia syria and venezuela and anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk antibribery act we are subject to numerous other laws on matters as diverse as internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures securities regulation data privacy and protection cybersecurity taxation antitrust and competition immigration wageandhour standards and employment and labor relations 

the us and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our operations are complex and may change rapidly and our efforts to comply and keep up with them require significant resources in some cases these laws and regulations may decrease the need for our services increase our costs negatively impact our revenues or impose operational limitations on our business including on the products and services we may offer or on the amount or type of compensation we may collect in addition the financial and operational impact of complying with laws and regulations has increased in the current environment of 

increased regulatory activity and enforcement changes with respect to the applicable laws and regulations may impose additional and unforeseen costs on us or pose new or previously immaterial risks to us there can be no assurance that current and future government regulations will not adversely affect our business and we cannot predict new regulatory priorities the form content or timing of regulatory actions and their impact on our business and operations 

while we attempt to comply with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we our employees our consultants and our contractors and other agents are in full compliance with such laws and regulations or interpretations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws or regulations if we fail to comply or are accused of failing to comply with applicable laws and regulations including those referred to above we may become subject to investigations criminal penalties civil remedies or other consequences including fines injunctions loss of an operating license or approval increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in a particular business or redress to clients or other parties and we may become exposed to negative publicity or reputational damage moreover our failure to comply with laws or regulations in one jurisdiction may result in increased regulatory scrutiny by other regulatory agencies in that jurisdiction or regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions these inquiries consume significant management attention and the cost of compliance and the consequences of failing to be in compliance could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition we may be responsible for the legal and regulatory liabilities of companies that we acquire in particular upon the consummation of the acquisition of jlt the company assumed the legal liabilities and became responsible for jlt’s litigation and regulatory exposures as of april 1 2019  additional information regarding certain ongoing investigations and certain other legal and regulatory proceedings is set forth in note 16 claims lawsuits and other contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under part ii item 8 of this report 

in most jurisdictions government regulatory authorities have the power to interpret and amend or repeal applicable laws and regulations and have discretion to grant renew and revoke the various licenses and approvals we need to conduct our activities such authorities may require the company to incur substantial costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations in some areas of our businesses we act on the basis of our own or the industrys interpretations of applicable laws or regulations which may conflict from state to state or country to country in the event those interpretations eventually prove different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities we may be penalized or precluded from carrying on our previous activities moreover the laws and regulations to which we are subject may conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate which increases the likelihood of our businesses being noncompliant in one or more jurisdictions 

our business or reputation could be harmed by our reliance on thirdparty providers or introducers 

we currently utilize the services of hundreds of thirdparty providers to meet the needs of our clients around the world 

there is a risk that our thirdparty providers or introducers engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies or violate applicable laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk antibribery act 

competitive risks 

the loss of members of our senior management team or other key colleagues or our efforts to attract and retain talent could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we rely upon the contributions of our senior management team to establish and implement our business strategy and to manage the future growth of our business we may be unable to retain them particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the labor market the loss of any of the senior management team could limit our ability to successfully execute our business strategy or adversely affect our ability to retain existing and attract new clients moreover we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team 

across all of our businesses our colleagues are critical to developing and retaining client relationships as well as performing the services on which our revenues are earned it is therefore important for us to 

attract incentivize and retain significant revenueproducing employees and the key managerial and other professionals who support them we face numerous challenges in this regard including the intense competition for talent which has accelerated through the pandemic such challenges include the general mobility of colleagues that has increased as a result of the covid19 pandemic as companies experiment with more flexible working models market dislocation resulting from proposed and actual combinations in the industry and fostering an inclusive and diverse workplace 

losing colleagues who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements which could adversely affect our results of operations if a key employee were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services if a colleague joins us from a competitor and is subject to enforceable restrictive covenants we may not be able to secure client engagements or maximize the colleagues potential 

over the course of 2021 we hired on a net basis more than 6000 colleagues across our company as a result our expenses have increased 

failure to maintain our corporate culture particularly in a hybrid work environment could damage our reputation 

we strive to foster a culture in which our colleagues act with integrity and feel comfortable speaking up about potential misconduct we are a people business and our ability to attract and retain colleagues and clients is dependent upon our commitment to an inclusive and diverse workplace trustworthiness ethical business practices and other qualities our colleagues are the cornerstone of this culture and acts of misconduct by any colleague and particularly by senior management could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients and other stakeholders remote and hybrid work arrangement as a result of the covid19 pandemic may also negatively impact our ability to maintain and promote our culture as we believe being together is integral to promoting our culture 

increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors clients and our colleagues with respect to our environmental social and governance esg practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks 

there is increased focus including from governmental organizations investors colleagues and clients on esg issues such as environmental stewardship climate change inclusion and diversity racial justice pay equity workplace conduct cybersecurity and data privacy negative public perception adverse publicity or negative comments in social media could damage our reputation if we do not or are not perceived to adequately address these issues any harm to our reputation could impact colleague engagement and retention and the willingness of clients and our partners to do business with us 

moreover as we work to align with the recommendations of the financial stability boards task force on climaterelated financial disclosures tcfd the sustainability accounting standards board sasb and our own esg assessments and priorities we expect to expand our public disclosures in these areas including providing additional metrics these metrics whether it be the standards we set for ourselves or a failure to meet these metrics and any failure accurately report or to achieve progress on our metrics on a timely basis or at all may negatively impact our reputation and our business 

in addition organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to esg matters and unfavorable ratings of our company or our industries may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other companies or industries exclusion of our stock from esgoriented indices or investment funds or harm our relationships with regulators and the communities in which we operate 

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses including from disintermediation as our competitive landscape continues to evolve 

as a global professional services firm the company faces competition in each of its businesses and the competitive landscape continues to change and evolve our ability to compete successfully depends on a variety of factors including the quality and expertise of our colleagues our geographic reach the sophistication and quality of our services our pricing relative to competitors our clients’ ability to selfinsure or use internal resources instead of consultants and our ability to respond to changes in client demand and industry conditions some of our competitors may have greater financial resources or may be better positioned to respond to technological and other changes in the industries we serve and they may be able to compete more effectively additionally the competition for talent has only accelerated with the covid19 pandemic and recent dislocation in the market resulting from proposed and actual combinations among our competitors if we are unable to attract retain and fully develop industry leading talent or if we are unable to respond successfully to the changing conditions we face our businesses results of operations and financial condition will be adversely impacted 

across our risk and insurance services segment we operate in a variety of markets and face different competitive landscapes in addition to the challenges posed by capital market alternatives to traditional insurance and reinsurance we compete against a wide range of other insurance and reinsurance brokerage and risk advisory firms that operate on a global regional national or local scale for both client business and employee talent in recent years private equity sponsors have invested tens of billions of dollars into the insurance brokerage sector transforming existing players and creating new ones to compete with large brokers we also compete with insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products directly to consumers and without the assistance of brokers or other market intermediaries and with various other companies that provide riskrelated services or alternatives to traditional brokerage services including those that rely almost exclusively on technological solutions or platforms this competition is intensified by an often syndicated or distributed approach to the purchase of insurance and reinsurance brokerage services where a client engages multiple brokers to service different portions of the clients account in addition third party capital providers have entered the insurance and reinsurance risk transfer market offering products and capital directly to our clients that serve as substitutes for traditional insurance 

in our consulting segment we compete for business with numerous consulting firms and similar organizations many of which also provide or are affiliated with firms that provide accounting information systems technology and financial services such competitors may be able to offer more comprehensive products and services to potential clients which may give them a competitive advantage in certain subsegments we compete in highly fragmented markets or with startups that may be able to offer solutions at a lower price or on more favorable conditions 

in addition companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate or combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients 

we rely on a large number of vendors and other third parties to perform key functions of our business operations and to provide services to our clients these vendors and third parties may act in ways that could harm our business 

we rely on a large number of vendors and other third parties and in some cases subcontractors to provide services data and information such as technology information security funds transfers business process management and administration and support functions that are critical to the operations of our business these third parties include correspondents agents and other brokers and intermediaries insurance markets data providers plan trustees payroll service providers software and system vendors health plan providers investment managers risk modeling providers and providers of human resource functions such as recruiters many of these providers are located outside the us which exposes us to business disruptions and political risks inherent when conducting business outside of the us as we do not control many of the actions of these third parties we are subject to the risk that their decisions or operations may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay in services or operations and additional expense 

a failure by the third parties to i comply with service level agreements in a high quality and timely manner particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services ii maintain adequate internal controls that may impact our own financial reporting or iii adequately maintain the confidentiality of any of our data or trade secrets or adequately protect or properly use other intellectual property to which they may have access could result in economic and reputational harm to us these third parties also face their own technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information or failure to comply with applicable law could cause harm to our reputation or otherwise expose us to liability an interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints noncompliance with legal regulatory or contractual obligations financial difficulties or for any other reason could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in contractual or regulatory penalties liability claims from clients or employees damage to our reputation and harm to our business 

macroeconomic risks 

the covid19 pandemic has impacted how we work and the extent to which it will continue to do so and its impact on our future financial results are uncertain 

global health concerns relating to the ongoing covid19 pandemic and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus impacted our workforce and operations and the operations of our clients thirdparty vendors and business partners the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices including continuing to operate in a largely remote model as the pandemic has persisted across the globe introducing vaccine mandates for certain us colleagues or visitors to be on premises where legally viable to do so and recalibrating returntooffice plans with evolving health and safety standards we will continue to evolve our business practices as we adopt hybrid working arrangements and evaluate further implementing employee vaccine requirements and other health and safety protocols as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our colleagues clients and business partners there is no certainty how long such policies will remain in effect or that such measures will be sufficient in creating an effective and productive working environment comparable to prepandemic conditions for our colleagues in addition our implementation of employee vaccination requirements may also result in attrition including of critically skilled colleagues 

our results of operations and investments could be adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions political events and market conditions 

macroeconomic conditions including inflation supply chain challenges pandemics a general slowdown in economic growth political volatility and other market conditions around the world affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve these conditions including inflationary expense pressure with our clients may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing for those services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for example in 2020 the covid19 pandemic adversely impacted the company’s revenue growth primarily in our businesses that are discretionary in nature changes in macroeconomic and political conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have a competitive advantage and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain 

in addition the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union referred to as brexit continues to create political and economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom and the european union as the terms of the withdrawal did not contain resolutions related to financial services and there has not yet been such an agreement there remains uncertainty on the effect of brexit on financial services 

we have significant operations and a substantial workforce in the uk with 12500 colleagues and approximately 16 of our revenue from the uk the uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of brexit may cause increased economic volatility or disrupt markets we serve affecting our operations and business or causing us to lose clients and colleagues in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate these developments may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of financial markets both in the uk and globally furthermore currency exchange rates in gbp and the euro with respect to each other and the us dollar have already been adversely affected by these developments should this foreign exchange volatility continue it could cause volatility in our quarterly financial results 

more generally our investments including our minority investments in other companies as well as our cash investments and those held in a fiduciary capacity are subject to general credit liquidity counterparty foreign exchange market and interest rate risks these risks may be exacerbated by global macroeconomic conditions market volatility and regulatory financial and other difficulties affecting the companies in which we have invested or that may be faced by financial institution counterparties during times of stress in the banking industry counterparty risk can quickly escalate potentially resulting in substantial trading and investment losses for corporate and other investors in addition we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may continue to experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels if the banking system or the fixed income interest rate credit or equity markets deteriorate the value and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected finally the value of the companys assets held in other jurisdictions including cash holdings may decline due to foreign exchange fluctuations 

business resiliency risks 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity or data recovery problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

if we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event such as an earthquake hurricane flood terrorist attack pandemic protests or riots security breach cyberattack including manipulating the control systems of critical infrastructure power loss or telecommunications failure our ability to operate will depend in part on the continued availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we could experience operational challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business the risk of business disruption is more pronounced in certain geographic areas including major metropolitan centers like new york or london where we have significant operations and approximately 3300 and 5300 colleagues in those respective locations and in certain countries and regions in which we operate that are subject to higher potential threat of terrorist attacks or military conflicts 

global health concerns relating to the ongoing covid19 pandemic and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have impacted our workforce and operations and the operations of our clients thirdparty vendors and business partners and could in the future materially adversely impact our business operations and financial results the spread of covid19 has caused us to take a number of steps to safeguard our business and colleagues from covid19 including implementing travel restrictions arranging work from home capabilities and transitioning to a hybrid work environment while the company expects it will continue to service clients effectively in a remote or hybrid work environment the extent to which the covid19 outbreak continues to impact our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which remain highly uncertain and are difficult to predict including the duration and spread of the outbreak its severity and that of new variants the availability and efficacy of treatments and vaccines and how quickly and to what extent prepandemic economic and operating conditions resume in addition as we prepare to return our workforce in more locations back to the office in 2022 we may experience increased costs as we prepare our facilities for a safe return to work environment and experiment with hybrid work models 

our operations depend in particular upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage if a business continuity event occurs we could lose client or company data or experience interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients which could have a material adverse effect such risks have increased significantly due to extended remote work accommodations as a result of covid19 a cyberattack or other business continuity event affecting us or a key vendor or other third party could result in a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or operations or our ability to recover data requiring us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues for example hackers have increasingly targeted companies by attacking internetconnected industrial control and safety control systems an extended outage could result in the loss of clients and a decline in our revenues in the worst case any manipulation of the control systems of critical infrastructure may even result in the loss of life 

we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity disaster recovery and data recovery plans and key management succession however a disaster or other continuity event on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover from such an event could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships and legal liability our business disruption insurance may also not fully cover in type or amount the cost of a successful recovery in the event of such a disruption 

acquisitions and dispositions risks 

we face risks when we acquire businesses 

we have a history of making acquisitions and investments including a total of 84 in the period from 2016 to 2021 we may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses that we acquire into our own business or achieve any expected cost savings or synergies from the integration of such businesses subject to standard contractual protections we may also be responsible for legacy liabilities of companies that we acquire for example upon the consummation of the acquisition of jlt the company assumed the legal liabilities and became responsible for jlt’s litigation and regulatory exposures as of april 1 2019 

in addition if in the future the performance of our reporting units or an acquired business varies from our projections or assumptions or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units or an acquired business change the estimated fair value of our reporting units or an acquired business could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill and other acquisitionrelated intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet or in adjustments in contingent payment amounts given the significant size of the companys goodwill and intangible assets an impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given period 

we expect that acquisitions will continue to be a key part of our business strategy our success in this regard will depend on our ability to identify and compete for appropriate acquisition candidates and to finance and complete the transactions we decide to pursue on favorable terms with positive results 

when we dispose of businesses we may continue to be subject to certain liabilities of that business after its disposition relating to the prior period of our ownership and may not be able to negotiate for limitations on those liabilities we are also subject to the risk that the sales price is less than the amount reflected on our balance sheet 

financial risks 

if we are unable to collect our receivables our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for the work we perform as of december 31 2021 our receivables for our commissions and fees were approximately 51 billion or approximately onequarter of our total annual revenues and portions of our receivables are increasingly concentrated in certain businesses and geographies 

macroeconomic or political conditions such as the impact from covid19 inflationary pressures or supply chain challenges could result in financial difficulties for our clients which could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us 

we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms 

the maintenance and growth of our business including our ability to finance acquisitions the payment of dividends and our ability to make share repurchases rely on our access to capital which depends in large part on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of equity and debt financing certain of our businesses such as gc securities a division of mmc securities llc and mmc securities europe limited also rely on financings by the company to fund the underwriting of their clients debt and equity capital raising transactions there can be no assurance that our operations will generate sufficient positive cash flow to finance all of our capital needs or that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on favorable terms in addition our ability to obtain financing will depend in part upon prevailing conditions in credit and capital markets which are beyond our control 

our defined benefit pension plan obligations could cause the companys financial position earnings and cash flows to fluctuate 

our defined benefit pension obligations and the assets set aside to fund those obligations are sensitive to certain changes in the financial markets any such changes may result in increased pension expense or additional cash payments to fund these plans 

the company has significant defined benefit pension obligations to its current and former employees totaling approximately 187 billion and related plan assets of approximately 194 billion at december 31 2021 on a us gaap basi s the companys policy for funding its defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth by law in the united states contributions to these plans are based on erisa guidelines outside the united states contributions are generally based on statutory requirements and local funding practices which may differ from measurements under us gaap in the uk for example the assumptions used to determine pension contributions are the result of legallyprescribed negotiations between the company and the plan trustees currently the use of these assumptions results in a lower funded status than determined under us gaap and may result in contributions irrespective of the us gaap funded status 

the financial calculations relating to our defined benefit pension plans are complex pension plan assets could decrease as the result of poor future asset performance in addition the estimated return on plan assets would likely be impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and other factors including equity valuations since these factors reflect the starting point used in the company’s projection models for example a reduction in interest rates may result in a reduction in the estimated return on plan assets also pension plan liabilities periodic pension expense and future funding amounts could increase as a result of a decline in the interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities longer lifespans than those reflected in our mortality assumptions changes in investment markets that result in lower expected returns on assets actual investment return that is less than the expected return on assets adverse changes in laws or regulations and other variables 

while we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of pension volatility on our earnings and cash funding requirements these strategies may not be successful accordingly given the magnitude of our worldwide pension plans variations in or reassessment of the preceding or other factors or potential miscalculations relating to our defined benefit pension plans could cause significant fluctuation from year to year in our earnings and cash flow as well as our pension plan assets and liabilities and may result in increased levels of contributions to our pension plans 

our significant nonus operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business 

approximately 53 of our total revenue reported in 2021 was from business outside of the united states we are subject to exchange rate movement because we must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars and also because some of our subsidiaries receive revenue other than in their functional currencies exchange rate movements may change over time and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows reported in us dollars for additional discussion see market risk and credit riskforeign currency risk in part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this report 

our quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly 

quarterly variations in revenues and operating results may occur due to several factors these include 

• the number of client engagements during a quarter 

• the possibility that clients may decide to delay or terminate a current or anticipated project as a result of factors unrelated to our work product or progress 

• fluctuations in capacity and utilization rates and clients ability to terminate engagements without penalty 

• our net colleague hires and related compensation and benefits expense 

• potential limitations on the clients or industries we serve resulting from increased regulation or changing stakeholder expectations on esg issues 

• the impact of changes in accounting standards or in our accounting estimates or assumptions 

• the impact on us or our clients of changes in legislation regulation and legal guidance or interpretations in the jurisdictions in which we operate in particular as a result of increased regulatory activity and enforcement 

• seasonality due to the impact of regulatory deadlines policy renewals and other timing factors to which our clients are subject 

• the success of our acquisitions or investments 

• macroeconomic factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates interest rates and global securities markets particularly in the case of mercer where fees in its investments business and certain other business lines are derived from the value of assets under management advisement or administration and 

• general economic conditions including factors beyond our control affecting economic conditions such as covid19 and other global health crises or pandemics severe weather climate change geopolitical unrest such as protests and riots or other catastrophic events since our results of operations are directly affected by the levels of business activity of our clients which in turn are affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve 

a significant portion of our total operating expenses is relatively fixed in the short term therefore a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results for these businesses 

credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk 

currently the companys senior debt is rated a by sp and baa1 by moodys the company carries a stable outlook with both sp and moodys 

if we need to raise capital in the future for example in order to maintain adequate liquidity fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could limit our access to financing sources a downgrade to a rating below investmentgrade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures 

our current debt level could adversely affect our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2021 we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 110 billion 

the level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility by reducing our cash flows and our ability to use cash from operations for other purposes including working capital dividends to shareholders share repurchases acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate purposes in addition we are subject to risks that at the time any of our outstanding debt matures we will not be able to retire or refinance the debt on terms that are acceptable to us 

the current us tax regime makes our results more difficult to predict 

our effective tax rate may fluctuate in the future as a result of the current us tax regime and the continuing issuance of interpretive guidance related to the operations of usbased multinational corporations these include significant changes in us income tax law that has a meaningful impact on our provision for income taxes and requires significant judgments and estimates in interpretation and calculations the enacted tax legislation included among other provisions limitations on the deductibility of net interest expense a tax on global intangible lowtaxed income gilti and the base erosion and antiabuse tax beat given the significant complexity of the rules and the potential for additional guidance from us treasury the securities and exchange commission the financial accounting standards board or other regulatory authorities recognized impacts in future periods could be significantly different from our current estimates such uncertainty may also result in increased scrutiny from or disagreements with tax authorities in addition changes under consideration to the current us tax regime including to the gilti minimum tax further limitations on interest expense deductibility and a 

book minimum tax could increase the impact of the provision on our results as a usdomiciled company any such increases would have a disproportionate impact on us compared to our foreignbased competitors 

global operations 

we are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations 

we conduct business globally in 2021 approximately 53 of the companys total revenue was generated from operations outside the united states and over onehalf of our employees were located outside the united states in addition we conduct our operations through four separate businesses potential conflicts of interest may arise across our businesses given the significant volume of our engagements 

the geographic breadth of our activities also subjects us to significant legal economic operational market compliance and reputational risks these include among others risks relating to 

• economic and political conditions in the countries in which we operate 

• client concentration in certain highgrowth countries in which we operate 

• the length of payment cycles and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable 

• unexpected increases in taxes or changes in us or foreign tax laws rulings policies or related legal and regulatory interpretations including upcoming changes to the uk statutory rate and international initiatives to require multinational enterprises like ours to calculate and report profitability on a countrybycountry basis which could increase scrutiny by or cause disagreements with foreign tax authorities and the uncertainty around the implementation of the new global minimum tax the framework of which was agreed by the members of the organization for economic cooperation and development in late 2021 

• potential transfer pricingrelated tax exposures that may result from the flow of funds among our subsidiaries and affiliates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 

• permanent establishments created due to colleagues traveling to and doing work in countries where the company has no presence or living in such countries and working remotely postpandemic which are not properly compensated through transfer pricing 

• our ability to obtain dividends or repatriate funds from our nonus subsidiaries including as a result of the imposition of currency controls and other government restrictions on repatriation in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the imposition of withholding and other taxes on such payments 

• international hostilities international trade disputes geopolitical tensions in countries in which we operate terrorist activities natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions 

• local investment or other financial restrictions that foreign governments may impose 

• potential lawsuits investigations market studies reviews or other activity by foreign regulatory or law enforcement authorities or legislatively appointed commissions which may result in potential modifications to our businesses related private litigation or increased scrutiny from us or other regulators 

• potential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including tax systems administered by foreign government agencies some of which may conflict with us or other sources of law 

• potential costs and difficulties in complying or monitoring compliance with foreign and us laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations abroad including trade sanctions laws relating to countries such as belarus cuba crimea iran myanmar north korea russia syria and venezuela and anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010 

• limitations or restrictions that foreign or us governments and regulators may impose on the products or services we sell the methods by which we sell our products and services and the manner in which and the amounts we are compensated 

• potential limitations or difficulties in protecting our intellectual property in various foreign jurisdictions 

• limitations that foreign governments may impose on the conversion of currency or the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our nonus subsidiaries 

• engaging and relying on third parties to perform services on behalf of the company and 

• potential difficulties in monitoring employees in geographically dispersed locations 

risks relating to our risk and insurance services segment 

our risk and insurance services segment conducted through marsh and guy carpenter represented 61 of the companys total revenue in 2021 our business in this segment is subject to particular risks 

results in our risk and insurance services segment may be a dversely affected by a general decline in economic activity 

demand for many types of insurance and reinsurance generally rises or falls as economic growth expands or slows this dynamic affects the level of commissions and fees generated by marsh and guy carpenter to the extent our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions they may choose to limit their purchases of insurance and reinsurance coverage as applicable which would inhibit our ability to generate commission revenue and other revenue based on premiums placed by us also the insurance they seek to obtain through us may be impacted by changes in their assets property values sales or number of employees which may reduce our commission revenue and they may decide not to purchase our risk advisory or other services which would inhibit our ability to generate fee revenue moreover insolvencies and combinations associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies and combinations in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by limiting our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business as well as our revenues from insurers guy carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the marketplace 

volatility or declines in premiums and other market trends may significantly impede our ability to grow revenues and profitability 

a significant portion of our risk and insurance services revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to the normal cycles of pricing in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

as traditional insurance companies continue to rely on nonaffiliated brokers or agents to generate premium those insurance companies may seek to reduce their expenses by lowering their commission rates the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility or declines in premiums may significantly affect our revenue and profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes it is difficult to accurately forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result we may have to adjust our plans for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by disintermediation and the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their riskprotection needs this trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to selfinsure the use of captive insurers and the presence of capital marketsbased solutions for traditional insurance and reinsurance needs further the profitability of our risk and insurance services segment depends in part on our ability to be compensated for the analytical services and other advice that we provide including the consulting and analytics services that we provide to insurers if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for all of our services our margins and profitability could decline 

adverse legal developments and future regulations concerning how intermediaries are compensated by insurers or clients as well as allegations of anticompetitive behavior or conflicts of interest more broadly could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the ways in which insurance intermediaries are compensated receive scrutiny from regulators in part because of the potential for anticompetitive behavior and conflicts of interest the vast majority of the compensation that marsh receives is in the form of retail fees and commissions that are paid by the client or paid from premium that is paid by the client the amount of other compensation that we receive from insurance companies separate from retail fees and commissions has increased in the last several years both on an underlying basis and through acquisition an d represented approximately 6 of marshs revenue in 2021 this other compensation includes payment for i consulting and analytics services provided to insurers ii administrative and other services provided to insurers including underwriting services and services relating to the administration and management of quota shares panels and other facilities and iii contingent commissions primarily at mma and outside the us paid by insurers based on factors such as volume or profitability these other revenue streams present potential regulatory litigation and reputational risks that may arise from alleged anticompetitive behavior or conflicts of interest including those arising from guy carpenter’s role as intermediary and advisor for insurance companies and future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect such revenue adverse regulatory legal or other developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and expose the company to negative publicity and reputational harm 

risks relating to our consulting segment 

our consulting segment conducted through mercer and oliver wyman group represented 39 of our total revenue in 2021 our businesses in this segment are subject to particular risks 

mercer’s investments business is subject to a number of risks including risks related to market fluctuations thirdparty asset managers operational and technology risks conflicts of interest asset performance and regulatory compliance that if realized could result in significant damage to our business 

mercer’s investments business provides clients with digital tools investment consulting and investment management services as of december 31 2021 mercer and its global affiliates had assets under management of approximately 415 billion worldwide in the investment consulting business clients make and implement their own investment decisions based upon research prepared or advice provided by mercer in its investment management business mercer implements the client’s investment policy by engaging overseeing and making changes to the thirdparty asset managers who determine which investments to buy and sell to effect implementation of a client’s investment policy mercer may utilize its manager of managers investment funds 

mercer’s investments business is subject to a number of risks including risks related to litigation particularly as we increasingly act in a fiduciary capacity liquidity and market volatility thirdparties our operations and technology conflicts of interest asset performance and regulatory compliance and scrutiny which could arise in connection with these offerings for example mercer’s manager research or due diligence on an asset manager may fail to uncover material deficiencies or fraud that could result in investment losses to a client there is a risk that mercer will fail to properly or timely implement a client’s investment policy or direction which could cause an incorrect or untimely allocation of client assets among asset classes asset managers or strategies mercer may also be perceived as recommending certain asset managers to clients or offering delegated solutions to an investment consulting client solely to enhance its own compensation or due to other perceived conflicts of interest asset classes may perform poorly or asset managers may underperform their benchmarks due to poor m arket performance a downturn in the global markets negligence or other reasons resulting in poor returns or loss of client assets changes in the value of equity debt currency real estate commodities alternatives or other asset classes in particular as a result of a downturn in the global markets could cause the value of our assets under management or advisement and the fees earned by mercer to decline these risks if realized could result in significant liability and damage our business 

revenues for the services provided by our consulting segment may decline for various reasons including as a result of changes in economic conditions the value of equity debt and other asset classes our clients’ or an industrys financial condition or government regulation or an accelerated trend away from actively managed investments to passively managed investments 

global economic conditions particularly the impact of covid19 may negatively impact businesses and financial institutions many of our clients including financial institutions corporations government entities and pension plans have reduced expenses including amounts spent on consulting services and used internal resources instead of consultants during difficult economic periods the evolving needs and financial circumstances of our clients may reduce demand for our consulting services and could adversely affect our revenues and profitability if the economy or markets in which we operate experience weakness or deteriorate our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition some of mercers investments business generate fees based upon the value of the clients’ assets under management or advisement changes in the value of equity debt currency real estate commodities alternatives or other asset classes could cause the value of assets under management or advisement and the fees received by mercer to decline such changes could also cause clients to withdraw funds from mercer’s investments business in favor of other investment service providers in either case our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected mercer’s investments business also could be adversely affected by an accelerated shift away from actively managed investments to passively managed investments with associated lower fees further revenue received by mercer as investment manager to the majority of the mercermanaged investment funds is reported in accordance with us gaap on a gross ba sis rather than a net basis with subadvisor fees reflected as an expense therefore the reported revenue for these offerings does not fully reflect the amount of net revenue ultimately attributable to mercer 

demand for many of mercers benefits services is affected by government regulation and tax laws rulings policies and interpretations which drive our clients needs for benefitsrelated services significant changes in government regulations affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of mercers services 

factors affecting defined benefit pension plans and the services we provide relating to those plans could adversely affect mercer 

mercer currently provides plan sponsors plan trustees multiemployer and public entity clients with actuarial consulting and administration services relating to defined benefit pension plans the nature of our work is complex many clients particularly in the public sector have sizeable pension deficits and are subject to impact from volatility in the global markets and interest rate fluctuations a number of mercers clients have frozen or curtailed their defined benefit plans and have moved to defined contribution plans resulting in reduced revenue for mercers retirement business these developments fee compression pressures and a continued or accelerated rate of decline in revenues for our defined benefit pension plans business could adversely affect mercers business and operating results in addition our actuarial services involve numerous assumptions and estimates regarding future and contingent events including interest rates used to discount future liabilities estimated rates of return for a plans assets healthcare cost trends salary projections and participants life expectancies mercers consulting services involve the drafting and interpretation of trust deeds and other complex documentation governing pension plans mercers administration services include calculating benefits within complicated pension plan structures mercers investments services include investment advice and management relating to defined benefit pension plan assets intended to fund present and future benefit obligations clients dissatisfied with our services have brought and may bring significant claims against us particularly in the united states and the united kingdom 

the profitability of our consulting segment may decline if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and pricing rates for our consultants 

the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on ensuring that our consultants maintain adequate utilization rates ie the percentage of our consultants working hours devoted to billable activities our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

• our ability to transition consultants promptly from completed projects to new assignments and to engage newlyhired consultants quickly in revenuegenerating activities 

• our ability to continually secure new business engagements particularly because a portion of our work is projectbased rather than recurring in nature 

• our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain appropriate headcount in each of our geographies and workforces 

• our ability to retain key colleagues and consulting professionals 

• unanticipated changes in the scope of client engagements 

• the potential for conflicts of interest that might require us to decline client engagements that we otherwise would have accepted 

• our need to devote time and resources to sales training professional development and other nonbillable activities 

• the potential disruptive impact of acquisitions and dispositions and 

• general economic conditions 

if the utilization rate for our consulting professionals declines our revenues profit margin and profitability could decline 

in addition the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on the prices we are able to charge for our services the prices we charge are affected by a number of factors including 

• clients perception of our ability to add value through our services 

• market demand for the services we provide 

• our ability to develop new services and the introduction of new services by competitors 

• the pricing policies of our competitors 

• the extent to which our clients develop inhouse or other capabilities to perform the services that they might otherwise purchase from us and 

• general economic conditions 

if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for our services our profit margin and profitability could decline

income taxes 

the companys consolidated effective tax rate was 246 and 267 in 2021 and 2020 respectively the rates in all periods reflect the effects of tax planning and the impact of regulatory and other guidance as it became available 

the rate for the year ended december 31 2021 reflects 

• the charge for remeasuring the company’s uk deferred tax assets and liabilities upon the enactment of legislation on june 10 2021 commonly referred to as the finance act 2021 the legislation increased the uk corporate income tax rate from 19 to 25 effective april 1 2023 this is the most significant discrete item in the yeartodate period increasing the company’s effective tax rate by 26 for the year ended december 31 2021 

• the tax effect of the gain from the fair value remeasurement of the company’s previously held equity method investment in marsh india upon the company increasing its ownership interest from 49 to 92 the company has indefinitely reinvested this gain as it has no intent to dispose of the business and did not record tax on the gain this decreased the company’s effective tax rate by 15 for the year ended december 31 2021 

• tax benefits from planning implemented in the period that postponed the utilization of losses in the uk to a future year when the tax rate will be 25 

the tax rate in 2020 includes a valuation allowance for certain tax credits the impact of uncertain tax positions and certain tax planning benefits the rate in 2020 also reflects costs of remeasuring the company’s uk deferred tax assets and liabilities upon the enactment of legislation that cancelled a 2 reduction in the uk corporate income tax rate partially offset by tax benefits for the implementation of a new international funding structure to facilitate global staffing and contracting 

the tax rates in all periods reflect the impact of discrete tax matters such as excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation enacted tax legislation changes in uncertain tax positions deferred tax adjustments and nontaxable adjustments to contingent acquisition consideration 

the effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future the effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings and repatriation of the companys earnings which may result in higher or lower tax rates in 2021 pretax income in the uk barbados canada ireland bermuda and australia accounted for approximately 60 of the companys total nonus pretax income with effective rates in those countries of 21 excluding the noncash deferred tax impact of uk tax legislation enacted in 2021 1 27 17 03 and 16 respectively 

in addition losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate depending on estimates of the value of associated deferred tax assets which can be realized a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that the company believes is more likely than not to be realized details are provided in note 7 income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation 

changes in tax laws rulings policies or related legal and regulatory interpretations occur frequently and may also have significant favorable or adverse impacts on our effective tax rate 

as a us domiciled parent holding company the company is the issuer of essentially all of the companys external indebtedness and incurs the related interest expense in the us the company’s interest expense deductions are not currently limited further most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the us and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the us some of these expenses may not be deductible in the us which may impact the effective tax rate 

the quasiterritorial tax regime provides an opportunity for the company to repatriate foreign earnings more tax efficiently and there is less incentive for permanent reinvestment of these earnings however permanent reinvestment continues to be a component of the company’s global capital strategy the company continues to evaluate its global investment and repatriation strategy in light of our capital requirements and potential costs of repatriation 

the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act was signed into law on march 27 2020 the cares act provided over 2 trillion in economic relief to individuals governmental agencies and companies to deal with the public health and economic impacts of covid19 pursuant to the cares act the company deferred payroll taxes due from march 27 2020 through december 31 2020 and paid 50 in 2021 and will pay the remaining 50 in 2022 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company is organized as a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries as the company does not have significant operations of its own the company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt obligations pay dividends to stockholders repurchase its shares and pay corporate expenses the company can also provide financial support to its operating subsidiaries for acquisitions investments and certain parts of their business that require liquidity such as the capital markets business of guy carpenter other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities in financing cash flows 

the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the us funds from those operating subsidiaries are regularly repatriated to the us out of annual earnings at december 31 2021  the company had approximately 737 million of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations which includes 280 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements the company expects to continue its practice of repatriating available funds from its nonus operating subsidiaries out of current annual earnings where appropriate a portion of the current year earnings will continue to be permanently reinvested 

during 2021 the company recorded foreign currency translation adjustments w hich decreased net equity by 389 million continued weakening of the us dollar against foreign currencies would further increase the translated us dollar value of the company’s net investments in its nonus subsidiaries as well as 

the translated us dollar value of cash repatriations from those subsidiaries conversely strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies would decrease the translated us dollar value of the company’s net investments in its nonus subsidiaries as well as the translated us dollar value of cash repatriations from those subsidiaries 

cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the company 

operating cash flows 

the company generated 35 billion of cash from operations in 2021 and 34 billion in 2020 these amounts reflect the net income of the company during those periods excluding gains or losses from investments adjusted for noncash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments of accrued liabilities or receipts of assets and pension contributions 

pensionrelated items 

contributions 

during 2021 the company contributed 35 million to its us pension plans and 95 million to nonus pension plans compared to contributions of 65 million to us plans and 78 million to nonus plans in 2020 

in the us contributions to the taxqualified defined benefit plans are based on erisa guidelines and the company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80 or more of the liability determined in accordance with the erisa guidelines in 2021 the company made 30 million of contributions to nonqualified plans and 5 million to its qualified plans the company expects to contribute approximately 31 million to its nonqualified us pension plans in 2022 the company is not required to make any contributions to its us qualified plan in 2022 

outside the us the company has a large number of nonus defined benefit pension plans the largest of which are in the uk which comprise approximately 81 of nonus plan assets at december 31 2021 contribution rates for nonus plans are generally base d on local funding practices and statutory requirements which may differ significantly from measurements under us gaap 

the company contributed 55 million to its uk plans in 2021 the companys contributions to its uk plans in 2022 are expected to be approximately 124 million 

in the uk the assumptions used to determine pension contributions are the result of legallyprescribed negotiations between the company and the plans trustee that typically occur every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans currently this results in a lower funded status 

compared to us gaap and may result in contributions irrespective of the us gaap funded status 

during 2021 the jlt pension scheme was merged into the mmc uk pension fund with a new segregated jlt section created the company made deficit contributions of 38 million to the jlt section in 2021 and is expected to make contributions totaling approximately 112 million in 2022 the funding level of the jlt section will be reassessed during 2022 to determine contributions in 2023 and onwards  

for the mmc uk pension fund excluding the jlt section an agreement was reached with the trustee in fourth quarter of 2019 based on the surplus funding position at december 31 2018 in accordance with the agreement no deficit funding is required until 2023 the funding level will be reassessed during 2022 as part of the december 31 2021 actuarial valuation to determine if contributions are required in 2023 as part of a longterm strategy which depends on having greater influence over asset allocation and overall investm ent decisions in november 2019 the company renewed its agreement to support annual deficit contributions by the uk operating companies under certain circumstances up to £450 million over a sevenyear period

changes in funded status and expense 

the yearoveryear change in the funded status of the companys pension plans is impacted by the difference between actual and assumed results particularly with regard to return on assets and changes in the discount rate as well as the amount of company contributions if any unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately 18 billion and 29 billion at december 31 2021 for the us plans and nonus plans respectively compared with losses of 24 billion and 35 billion at december 31 2020 the decreases in both the us and nonus plans were primarily due to an increase in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities and an increase in asset values in the past several years the amount of unamortized losses has been significantly impacted both positively and negatively by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities in 2021 increased in the us and uk the companys largest plans following decreases in 2020 and 2019 an increase in the discount rate decreases the measured plan benefit obligation resulting in actuarial gains while a decrease in the discount rate increases the measured plan obligation resulting in actuarial losses during 2021 the companys defined benefit pension plan assets had gains of 132 and 19 in the us and uk respectively as compared to gains of 131 and 120 in the us and uk respectively in 2020 

overall based on the measurement at december 31 2021 net benefit credits related to the company’s defined benefit plans are expected to decrease in 2022 by approximately 23 million compared to 2021 reflecting a decrease in nonus plans of approximately 40 million offset by an increase in us plans of 17 million

management’s discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates 

management makes estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from those estimates 

revenue recognition 

in the risk and insurance services segment judgments related to the amount of variable revenue consideration to ultimately be received on placement of quota share reinsurance treaties and contingent commission from insurers which was previously recognized when the contingency was resolved now requires significant judgments and estimates 

management also makes significant judgments and estimates to measure the progress toward completing performance obligations and realization rates for consideration related to contracts as well as potential performancebased fees in the consulting segment 

the company capitalizes the incremental costs to obtain contracts primarily related to commissions or sales bonus payments these deferred costs are amortized over the expected life of the underlying customer relationships the company also capitalizes certain preplacement costs that are considered fulfillment costs that are amortized at a point in time when the associated revenue is recognized 

see note 2 revenue in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

legal and other loss contingencies 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions eo the company records a liability when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable which requires significant management judgment the company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel an internal actuarial analysis by oliver wyman a subsidiary of the company and other methods to estimate potential losses the liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable given the unpredictability of eo claims and of litigation that could arise from such claims it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the company’s businesses results of operations financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period 

in addition to the extent that insurance coverage is available significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the company’s various insurance programs 

retirement benefits 

the company maintains qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible us employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible nonus employees the company’s policy for funding its taxqualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable foreign laws 

the company recognizes the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 

net of tax in the company’s consolidated balance sheets the gains and losses that exceed specified corridors 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets are amortized prospectively out of aoci over a period that approximates the remaining life expectancy of participants in plans where substantially all participants are inactive or the average remaining service period of active participants for plans with active participants the vast majority of unrecognized losses relate to inactive plans and are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the participants 

the determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate mortality and assumed rate of salary increase the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in note 8 retirement benefits in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

the longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption is determined for each plan based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of the measurement date and the specific portfolio mix of each plan’s assets the company utilizes a model developed by mercer a subsidiary of the company to assist in the determination of this assumption the model takes into account several factors including target portfolio allocation investment administrative and trading expenses incurred directly by the plan trust historical portfolio performance relevant forwardlooking economic analysis and expected returns variances and correlations for different asset classes these measures are used to determine probabilities using standard statistical techniques to calculate a range of expected returns on the portfolio 

the target asset allocation for the us plans is 60 equities and equity alternatives and 40 fixed income at the end of 2021 the actual allocation for the us plans was 65 equities and equity alternatives and 35 fixed income the target asset allocation for the uk plans which comprise approximately 81 of nonus plan assets is 26 equities and equity alternatives and 74 fixed income at the end of 2021 the actual allocation for the uk plans was 28 equities and equity alternatives and 72 fixed income 

the discount rate selected for each us plan is based on a model bond portfolio with coupons and redemptions that closely match the expected liability cash flows from the plan discount rates for nonus plans are based on appropriate bond indices adjusted for duration in the uk the plan duration is reflected using the mercer yield curve 

the following table shows the weighted average assumed rate of return and the discount rate at the december 31 2021 measurement date used to measure pension expense in 2022 for the total company the us and the rest of world row 



holding all other assumptions constant a halfpercentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the us and uk plans which together comprise approximately 86 of total pension plan liabilities as follows 



the impact of discount rate changes relates to the increase or decrease in actuarial gains or losses being amortized through net periodic pension cost as well as the increase or decrease in interest expense with all other facts and assumptions held constant it does not contemplate nor include potential future impacts a change in the interest rate environment and discount rates might cause such as the impact on the market value of the plans’ assets in addition the assumed return on plan assets would likely be impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and other factors including equity valuations since these factors reflect the starting point used in the company’s projection models for example a reduction in interest rates may result in a reduction in the assumed return on plan assets changing the discount rate 

and leaving the other assumptions constant also may not be representative of the impact on expense because the longterm rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost 

the company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees the cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the us is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire but is funded by the company as incurred the key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in note 8 retirement benefits in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions the company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the evaluation of a tax position is a twostep process 

• first the company determines whether it is morelikelythannot a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on only the technical merits of the position if a tax position does not meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements 

• the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue 

the company recognizes interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense the company’s accounting policy follows the portfolio approach that leaves stranded income tax effects in aoci 

certain items are included in the companys tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as nondeductible expenses and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities which are measured at existing tax rates deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements the company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company also considers tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carry back of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law the underlying assumptions the company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the companys recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carryforwards are deductible or creditable valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is morelikelythannot that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction 

fair value determinations 

goodwill impairment testing – the company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred the company performs the annual impairment assessment for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year a company can assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test alternatively the company may elect to proceed directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test in 2021 the company elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment as part of its assessment the company considered numerous factors including 

• that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by a substantial margin based on its most recent quantitative assessment in 2019 

• whether significant acquisitions or dispositions occurred which might alter the fair value of its reporting units 

• macroeconomic conditions and their potential impact on reporting unit fair values 

• actual performance compared with budget and prior projections used in its estimation of reporting unit fair values 

• industry and market conditions and 

• the yearoveryear change in the company’s share price 

the company completed its qualitative assessment in the third quarter of 2021 and concluded that a quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required in 2021 and that goodwill was not impaired 

purchase price allocation 

assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration as part of a business acquisition are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition the excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill determining fair value of identifiable assets particularly intangibles and liabilities acquired also requires management to make estimates which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset these estimates directly impact the amount of identified intangible assets recognized and the related amortization expense in future periods

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk and credit risk 

certain of the company’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets 

interest rate risk and credit risk 

interest income generated from the company’s cash cash equivalents and cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity will vary with the general level of interest rates 

the company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates 



based on the above balances if shortterm interest rates increased or decreased by 10 or 1 basis point over the course of the year annual interest income including interest earned on cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity would increase or decrease by approximately 1 million 

in addition to interest rate risk our cash investments and fiduciary cash investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counterparty credit risk to minimize this risk the company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a board approved investment policy the policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counterparty limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment the company carefully monitors its cash cash equivalents and cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions the majority of cash cash equivalents and cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity are invested in shortterm bank deposits and liquid money market funds 

foreign currency risk 

the translated values of revenue and expense from the company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates the nonus based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 53 of total revenue we periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business although the company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location as such under normal circumstances the us dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the us dollar generally tend to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk however there have been periods where the impact was not mitigated due to external market factors and external macroeconomic events may result in greater foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future if foreign exchange rates of major currencies euro sterling australian dollar and canadian dollar moved 10 in the same direction against the us dollar compared with the foreign exchange rates in 2021 the company estimates net operating income would increase or decrease by approximately 57 million the company has exposure to approximately 80 foreign currencies overall in continental europe the largest amount of revenue from renewals for the risk and insurance services segment o ccurs in the first quarter 

equity price risk 

the company holds investments in bo th public and private companies as well as private equity funds including investments of approximately 75 million that are valued using readily determinable fair values and approximately 36 million of investments without readily determinable fair values the company also has investments of approximately 207 million that are accounted for using the equity method the investments are subject to risk of decline in market value which if determined to be other than temporary for assets without readily determinable fair values could result in realized impairment losses the 

company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements 

at december 31 2021 the company owns approximately 14 of the common stock of alexander forbes af a south african company listed on the johannesburg stock exchange the investment in af is accounted at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as investment income loss in the consolidated statement of income the fair value of this investment at december 31 2021 was approximately 57 million

risk and insurance services  while laws and regulations vary from location to location every state of the united states and most foreign jurisdictions require insurance market intermediaries and related service providers such as insurance brokers agents and consultants reinsurance brokers and managing general agents to hold an individual or company license from a government agency or selfregulatory organization some jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locallyowned business entities in those instances if the company has no licensed subsidiary it may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction such arrangements are subject to an internal review and approval process licensing of reinsurance intermediaries is generally less rigorous compared to that of insurance brokers and most jurisdictions require only corporate reinsurance intermediary licenses

risks relating to the company generally 

macroeconomic risks 

the covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business operations results of operations cash flows and financial position 

global health concerns relating to the ongoing covid19 pandemic and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have had a dramatic impact on the macroeconomic environment and the outbreak continues to materially increase economic uncertainty and reduce economic activity 

the outbreak has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place or total lockdown orders and business limitations and shutdowns such measures have significantly contributed to decreased levels of business activity of our clients and the industries and markets that we serve governments around the globe have taken steps to mitigate some of the more severe anticipated economic effects of the virus but there can be no assurance that such steps will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion 

the outbreak has adversely impacted and is likely to further adversely impact our workforce and operations and the operations of our clients thirdparty vendors and business partners the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices including transitioning substantially all of our colleagues to a remote work environment restricting colleague travel developing social distancing plans for our colleagues and cancelling physical participation in meetings events and conferences and we 

may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our colleagues clients and business partners there is no certainty how long such policies will remain in effect or that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or will otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities 

the ongoing impacts of covid19 may affect our ability to generate new business our overall level of profitability and cash flow and our liquidity due to a number of macroeconomic and operational factors such factors may include 

• in our risk and insurance services segment a reduction in demand pricing and commission for specific lines of coverage most directly affected by covid19 

• in our consulting segment a reduction in fees or commission due to lower demand for our services as clients cut back on expenses the impact on our business model for delivering services to clients due to restrictions on travel and movement and guidance around social distancing and the impact on profitability and margin of not achieving or maintaining adequate utilization and pricing rates 

• the timeliness and ultimate collectability of our receivables including as a result of deferrals of premium payments directed by government authorities which affects our ability to generate sufficient cash flows 

• the impact of disruption in the credit or financial markets or changes to our credit ratings which may impact our ability to access capital or repay our significant outstanding indebtedness on favorable terms and our compliance with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness 

• an increase in errors  omissions claims related to losses incurred by policyholders arising from the pandemic 

• the impact of financial market volatility including our ability to execute timely trades in light of increased trading volume which may reduce assets under management and revenue for mercer’s investments business 

• failure of third parties upon which we rely to meet their obligations to us or significant disruptions in their ability to meet those obligations in a timely manner which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties 

• the impact of an extended period of remote work arrangements on our business continuity plans and our ability to continue to provide services to our clients 

• increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks or unauthorized dissemination of personal confidential proprietary or sensitive data caused by remote work arrangements and 

• the potential effects on our internal controls including those over financial reporting as a result of remote work arrangements that are applicable to our team members and business partners 

these factors may remain prevalent for a significant period of time and may continue to adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition even after the covid19 pandemic subsides for the year ended december 31 2020 the covid19 pandemic had an adverse impact to the company’s revenue growth primarily in our businesses that are discretionary in nature which was partly mitigated through disciplined expense management by implementing restrictions on travel and other cost containment measures however impacts from covid19 in 2020 may not be representative of future conditions the extent t o which the covid19 outbreak continues to impact our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which remain highly uncertain and are difficult to predict including the duration and spread of the outbreak its severity and strain mutations the actions to contain the virus and the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume even after the covid19 outbreak subsides we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus’s global economic impact including the availability of credit adverse impacts on our liquidity and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future 

there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of covid19 as a global pandemic may have and as a result the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and 

subject to change we do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business our operations or the global economy as a whole however the effects could have a material impact on our results of operations and heighten many of our known risks in this section 

our results of operations and investments could be adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions political events and market conditions 

macroeconomic conditions political events and other market conditions around the world affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve these conditions may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing for those services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations changes in macroeconomic and political conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have a competitive advantage and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain in particular please see above for detailed risks related to the impact of covid19 

in addition the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union referred to as brexit continues to create political and economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom and the european union while the british government and the eu negotiated terms of the withdrawal in december 2020 the agreement did not contain resolutions related to financial services accordingly there remains inevitable uncertainty on the treatment of financial services and the impact of the other terms of the agreement generally on our businesses 

we have significant operations and a substantial workforce in the uk with 12500 colleagues and approximately 16 of our revenue from the uk the uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of brexit may cause increased economic volatility affecting our operations and business the effects of brexit will depend on the agreements the uk makes to retain access to european union markets and the systems put in place to facilitate future trade and economic relationships the measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose clients and colleagues in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which european union laws to replace or replicate these developments may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of financial markets both in the uk and globally any of these factors could affect the demand for our services furthermore currency exchange rates in gbp and the euro with respect to each other and the us dollar have already been adversely affected by these developments should this foreign exchange volatility continue it could cause volatility in our quarterly financial results 

more generally our investments including our minority investments in other companies as well as our cash investments and those held in a fiduciary capacity are subject to general credit liquidity counterparty foreign exchange market and interest rate risks these risks may be exacerbated by global macroeconomic conditions market volatility and regulatory financial and other difficulties affecting the companies in which we have invested or that may be faced by financial institution counterparties during times of stress in the banking industry counterparty risk can quickly escalate potentially resulting in substantial trading and investment losses for corporate and other investors in addition we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may continue to experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels if the banking system or the fixed income interest rate credit or equity markets deteriorate the value and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected finally the value of the companys assets held in other jurisdictions including cash holdings may decline due to foreign exchange fluctuations 

technology cybersecurity and data protection risks 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to develop and implement improvements in technology or respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological change 

we depend in large part on our technology systems for conducting business as well as for providing the data and analytics we use to manage our business as a result our business success is dependent on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and on continuing to develop and enhance technology systems that support our business processes and strategic initiatives in a cost and resource efficient manner particularly as our business processes become more digital we have a number of 

strategic initiatives involving investments in or partnerships with technology companies as part of our growth strategy as well as investments in technology and infrastructure to support our own systems 

these investments may be costly and require significant capital expenditures may not be profitable or may be less profitable than what we have experienced historically in addition investments in technology systems may not deliver the benefits or perform as expected or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected which could result in operational difficulties or additional costs in some cases we also depend on key vendors and partners to provide technology and other support for our strategic initiatives if these vendors or partners fail to perform their obligations or otherwise cease to work with us our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected if we do not keep up with technological changes or execute effectively on our strategic initiatives our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

in addition to remain competitive in many of our business areas we must anticipate and respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological change the threat comes from traditional players such as insurers through disintermediation as well as from new entrants such as technology companies insurtech startup companies and others in the past few years there has been a substantial increase in private equity investments into these insurtech companies these players are focused on using technology and innovation including artificial intelligence ai digital platforms data analytics robotics and blockchain to simplify and improve the client experience increase efficiencies alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the industries in which we operate 

we could incur significant liability or our reputation could be damaged if our information systems are breached or we otherwise fail to protect client or company data or information systems 

in operating our business and providing services and solutions to clients we collect use store transmit and otherwise process certain electronic information including personal confidential proprietary and sensitive data such as information related to financial records health care mergers and acquisitions and personal data of our clients colleagues and vendors we rely on the efficient uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business and securely process transmit and store electronic information in the normal course of business we also share electronic information with our vendors and other third parties this electronic information comprises sensitive and confidential data including information related to financial records health care mergers and acquisitions and clients’ personal data our information technology systems and safety control systems and those of our numerous thirdparty providers as well as the control systems of critical infrastructure they rely on such as power grids are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access damage or interruption from a variety of external threats including cyberattacks computer viruses and other malware ransomware and other types of data and systemsrelated modes of attack our systems are also subject to compromise from internal threats such as improper action by employees vendors and other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems moreover we face the ongoing challenge of managing access controls in a complex environment the latency of a compromise is often measured in months but could be years and we may not be able to detect a compromise in a timely manner we could experience significant financial and reputational harm if our information systems are breached sensitive client or company data are compromised surreptitiously modified rendered inaccessible for any period of time or maliciously made public or if we fail to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public or law enforcement agencies following any such event whether due to delayed discovery or a failure to follow existing protocols 

cyberattacks are increasing in frequency and evolving in nature we are at risk of attack by a variety of adversaries including statesponsored organizations organized crime hackers or hactivists activist hackers through use of increasingly sophisticated methods of attack including the deployment of artificial intelligence to find and exploit vulnerabilities such as “deep fakes” and longterm persistent attacks referred to as advanced persistent threats these techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems include among other things computer viruses malicious or destructive code ransomware social engineering attacks including phishing and impersonation hacking and denialofservice attacks because these techniques change frequently and new techniques may not be identified until they are launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures resulting in potential data loss data unavailability data corruption or 

other damage to information technology systems in addition remote work arrangements in response to covid19 have increased the risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks or unauthorized dissemination of personal confidential proprietary or sensitive data 

as the breadth and complexity of the technologies we use and the software and platforms we develop continue to grow including as a result of the use of mobile devices cloud services open source software social media and the increased reliance on devices connected to the internet known as the internet of things the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks also increases despite ongoing efforts to improve our ability to protect data from compromise we may not be able to protect all of our data across our diverse systems our efforts to improve and protect data from compromise may also identify previously undiscovered instances of security breaches or other cyber incidents our policies employee training including phishing prevention training procedures and technical safeguards may also be insufficient to prevent or detect improper access to confidential personal or proprietary information in addition the competition for talent in the data privacy and cybersecurity space is intense and we may also be unable to hire develop or retain suitable talent capable of adequately detecting mitigating or remediating these risks 

should an attacker gain access to our network using compromised credentials of an authorized user we are at risk that the attacker might successfully leverage that access to compromise additional systems and data certain measures that could increase the security of our systems such as data encryption including encryption of data at rest heightened monitoring and logging scanning for source code errors or deployment of multifactor authentication take significant time and resources to deploy broadly and such measures may not be deployed in a timely manner or be effective against an attack the inability to implement maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our information systems must be continually updated patched and upgraded to protect against known vulnerabilities the volume of new software vulnerabilities has increased markedly as has the criticality of patches and other remedial measures in addition to remediating newly identified vulnerabilities previously identified vulnerabilities must also be continuously addressed accordingly we are at risk that cyberattackers exploit these known vulnerabilities before they have been communicated by vendors or addressed due to the large number and age of the systems and platforms that we operate the increased frequency at which vendors are issuing security patches to their products the need to test patches and in some cases coordinate with clients and vendors before they can be deployed we perpetually face the substantial risk that we cannot deploy patches in a timely manner we are also dependent on third party vendors to keep their systems patched and secure in order to protect our data any failure related to these activities could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we have numerous vendors and other third parties who receive personal information from us in connection with the services we offer our clients we also use hundreds of it vendors and software providers to maintain and secure our global information systems infrastructure in addition we have migrated certain data and may increasingly migrate data to the cloud hosted by thirdparty providers some of these vendors and third parties also have direct access to our systems we are at risk of a cyberattack involving a vendor or other third party which could result in a breakdown of such third party’s data protection processes or the cyberattackers gaining access to our infrastructure through a supply chain attack for example in december 2020 it was widely reported that hackers installed malware into business software updates provided by solarwinds the attack was widespread affecting public and private organizations around the world including several us government agencies while we do not believe our operations were affected by this latest attack it highlighted the vulnerability of it supply chains 

we have a history of making acquisitions and investments and in april 2019 we completed the acquisition of jlt the process of integrating the information systems of any businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk for instance we may not adequately identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities in an acquired entity’s information systems either before or after the acquisition which could affect the value we are able to derive from the acquisition expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to a cyberattack in addition if we discover a historical compromise security breach or other cyber incident related to the target’s information systems following the close of the acquisition we may be liable and exposed to significant costs and other unforeseen 

liabilities we may also be unable to integrate the systems of the businesses we acquire into our environment in a timely manner which could further increase these risks until such integration takes place 

we have from time to time experienced data incidents and cybersecurity breaches such as malware incursions including computer viruses and ransomware users exceeding their data access authorization employee misconduct and incidents resulting from human error such as loss of portable and other data storage devices or misconfiguration of software or hardware resulting in inadvertent exposure of personal sensitive confidential or proprietary information like many companies we are subject to social engineering attacks such as regular phishing email campaigns directed at our employees that can result in malware infections and data loss although these incidents have resulted in data loss and other damages to date they have not had a material adverse effect on our business or operations in the future these types of incidents could result in personal sensitive confidential or proprietary information being lost or stolen surreptitiously modified rendered inaccessible for any period of time or maliciously made public including client employee or company data which could have a material adverse effect on our business in the event of a cyberattack we might have to take our systems offline which could interfere with services to our clients or damage our reputation we also may be unable to detect an incident assess its severity or impact or appropriately respond in a timely manner in addition our liability insurance which includes cyber insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches cyberattacks and other related data and system incidents 

the costs to comply with or our failure to comply with us and foreign laws related to privacy data security and data protection such as the eu general data protection regulation gdpr and the california consumer privacy act ccpa could adversely affect our financial condition operating results and our reputation 

improper disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny legal and financial liability or harm to our reputation in operating our business and providing services and solutions to clients particularly in our consulting segment we store and transfer sensitive employee and client data including personal data in and across multiple jurisdictions we leverage systems and applications that are spread all over the world requiring us to regularly move data across national borders as a result we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states europe and around the world regarding privacy data protection data security and cybersecurity these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing some of these laws and regulations are increasing the level of data handling restrictions including rules on data localization all of which could affect our operations and result in regulatory liability and high fines in particular highprofile security breaches at major companies continue to be disclosed regularly which is leading to even greater regulatory scrutiny and fines at the highest levels they have ever been 

the scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting for example the gdpr which became effective in may 2018 greatly increased the european commission’s jurisdictional reach of its laws and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data such as the public disclosure of data breaches privacy impact assessments data portability and the appointment of data protection officers in some cases in the us the ccpa came into effect in january 2019 and introduced several new concepts to local privacy requirements including increased transparency and rights such as access and deletion and an ability to opt out of the “sale” of personal information despite a proliferation of regulatory guidance papers much remains unclear with respect to how to interpret and implement the gdpr and the ccpa and that lack of clarity could result in potential liability for our failure to meet our obligations under the gdpr and the ccpa given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations including classifying data and committing to a range of administrative technical and physical controls to protect data and enable data transfers outside of the eu our compliance with laws such as the gdpr and the ccpa will continue to require time resources and review of the technology and systems we use further the european union court of justices schrems ii decision and brexit have created uncertainty with regard to the future of the flow of personal information between the united kingdom and the eu respectively and that uncertainty may impair our ability to offer our existing and planned products and services or increase our cost of doing business 

following the implementation of the gdpr other jurisdictions have sought to amend or propose legislation to amend their existing data protection laws to align with the requirements of the gdpr with 

the aim of obtaining an adequate level of data protection to facilitate the transfer of personal data to most jurisdictions from the eu accordingly the challenges we face in the eu will likely also apply to other jurisdictions that adopt laws similar to the gdpr or regulatory frameworks of equivalent complexity for example brazil has enacted its general data protection law the lei geral de proteção de dados pessoais which came into effect in august 2020 china has proposed a new comprehensive privacy law india is considering a new privacy law canada is proposing significant changes to their federal privacy law and japan has adopted sweeping changes to its privacy law in some cases including china and india the laws include data localization elements that will require that certain personal data stay within their borders 

looking at the us following the passage of the ccpa california recently approved a ballot measure that enacts the california privacy rights act making extensive modifications to the ccpa additionally several other states have introduced privacy bills some more comprehensive than the ccpa there is also continued legislative interest in passing a federal privacy law which is likely to accelerate under the new us administration 

in addition to data protection laws countries and states in the us are enacting cybersecurity laws and regulations for example the new york state department of financial services issued in 2017 cybersecurity regulations which imposed an array of detailed security measures on covered entities these requirements were phased in and the last of them came into effect on march 1 2019 all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time may divert resources from other initiatives and projects and could restrict the way services involving data are offered all of which may adversely affect our results of operations 

many statutory requirements both in the united states and abroad include obligations for companies to notify individuals of security breaches involving certain personal information which could result from breaches experienced by us or our vendors in addition to government regulation privacy advocates and industry groups have and may in the future propose selfregulatory standards from time to time these and other industry standards may legally or contractually apply to us or we may elect to comply with such standards we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws and regulations concerning data privacy and security and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws regulations and standards may have on our business 

furthermore enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations including a recent focus on website “cookies” compliance in some countries continue to increase privacy violations including unauthorized disclosure or transfer of sensitive or confidential client or company data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation by the company our vendors or other parties with whom we do business if they fail to meet the standards we impose could damage our reputation and subject us to significant litigation monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines and criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions given the complexity of operationalizing the various privacy laws such as the gdpr and the ccpa the maturity level of proposed compliance frameworks and the continued lack of clarity on how to implement their requirements we and our clients are at risk of enforcement actions taken by eu and other data protection authorities or litigation from consumer advocacy groups acting on behalf of data subjects we may not be able to respond quickly or effectively to regulatory legislative and other developments and these changes may in turn impair our ability to offer our existing or planned products and services and increase our cost of doing business 

  legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from errors and omissions breach of fiduciary duty and other claims 

our businesses provide numerous professional services including the placement of insurance and the provision of consulting investment advisory and actuarial services to clients around the world as a result the company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of errors and omissions breach of fiduciary duty and similar claims which we refer to collectively as eo claims in our risk and insurance services segment such claims include allegations of damages arising from our failure to assess clients’ risks advise clients place coverage or notify insurers of potential claims on behalf of clients in accordance with our obligations to them for example these claims may include allegations related to losses incurred by policyholders arising from the covid19 pandemic or losses from 

cyberattacks associated with policies where cyber risk was not specifically included or excluded in policies commonly referred to as “silent cyber” in our consulting segment where we increasingly act in a fiduciary capacity through our investments business such claims could include allegations of damages arising from the provision of consulting investments actuarial pension administration and other services we may also be exposed to claims related to assets or solutions offered by the consulting segment in complement to its traditional consulting services these consulting segment services frequently involve complex calculations and other analysis including i making assumptions about and preparing estimates concerning contingent future events ii drafting and interpreting complex documentation governing pension plans iii calculating benefits within complex pension structures iv providing individual financial planning advice including investment advice and advice relating to cashing out of defined benefit pension plans v providing investment advice including guidance on asset allocation and investment strategy and vi managing client assets including the selection of investment managers and implementation of the client’s investment policy we provide these services to a broad client base including clients in the public sector for our investment services matters often relate to services provided by the company dating back many years such claims may subject us to significant liability for monetary damages including punitive and treble damages negative publicity and reputational harm and may divert personnel and management resources we may be unable to effectively limit our potential liability in certain jurisdictions including through insurance or in connection with certain types of claims particularly those concerning claims of a breach of fiduciary duty 

in establishing liabilities for eo claims under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap the company uses case level reviews by inside and outside counsel actuarial analysis by oliver wyman a subsidiary of the company and other methods to estimate potential losses a liability is established when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable the liability is assessed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable given the judgment involved in estimating and establishing liabilities in accordance with us gaap as well as the unpredictability of eo claims and the litigation that can flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations or financial condition 

we cannot guarantee that we are or will be in compliance with all current and potentially applicable us federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states and its various states the united kingdom the european union and its member states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate for example we are subject to regulation by agencies such as the securities and exchange commission finra and state insurance regulators in the united states the fca and the competition and markets authority cma in the united kingdom and the european commission in the european union as further described above under part i item 1  business regulation of this report we are also subject to trade sanctions laws relating to countries such as cuba crimea iran north korea russia syria and venezuela and anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk antibribery act we are subject to numerous other laws on matters as diverse as internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures securities regulation data privacy and protection cybersecurity taxation antitrust and competition immigration wageandhour standards and employment and labor relations 

the us and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our operations are complex and may change rapidly and our efforts to comply and keep up with them require significant resources in some cases these laws and regulations may decrease the need for our services increase our costs negatively impact our revenues or impose operational limitations on our business including on the products and services we may offer or on the amount or type of compensation we may collect in particular changes at regulatory agencies in the us occur through policy and personnel changes following elections which often leads to changes involving the level of oversight and focus on businesses and certain industries in particular financial services accordingly the expectation is that there will be increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement action under the new administration 

while we attempt to comply with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we our employees our consultants and our contractors and other agents are in full compliance with such laws and regulations or interpretations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws or regulations if we fail to comply or are accused of failing to comply with applicable laws and regulations including those referred to above we may become subject to investigations criminal penalties civil remedies or other consequences including fines injunctions loss of an operating license or approval increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in a particular business or redress to clients or other parties and we may become exposed to negative publicity or reputational damage moreover our failure to comply with laws or regulations in one jurisdiction may result in increased regulatory scrutiny by other regulatory agencies in that jurisdiction or regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions these inquiries consume significant management attention and the cost of compliance and the consequences of failing to be in compliance could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition we may be responsible for the legal and regulatory liabilities of companies that we acquire in particular upon the consummation of the acquisition of jlt the company assumed the legal liabilities and became responsible for jlt’s litigation and regulatory exposures as of april 1 2019 in the fourth quarter 2020 the company recorded a 161 million provision for a legacy jlt matter related to an fca review of the suitability of financial advice to individuals for defined benefit pension transfers additional information regarding certain ongoing investigations and certain other legal and regulatory proceedings is set forth in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item 8 of this report 

in most jurisdictions government regulatory authorities have the power to interpret and amend or repeal applicable laws and regulations and have discretion to grant renew and revoke the various licenses and approvals we need to conduct our activities such authorities may require the company to incur substantial costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations in some areas of our businesses we act on the basis of our own or the industrys interpretations of applicable laws or regulations which may conflict from state to state or country to country in the event those interpretations eventually prove different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities we may be penalized or precluded from carrying on our previous activities moreover the laws and regulations to which we are subject may conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate which increases the likelihood of our businesses being noncompliant in one or more jurisdictions 

our business or reputation could be harmed by our reliance on thirdparty providers or introducers 

we currently utilize the services of hundreds of thirdparty providers to meet the needs of our clients around the world 

there is a risk that our thirdparty providers or introducers engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies or violate applicable laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk antibribery act 

competitive risks 

the loss of members of our senior management team or other key colleagues could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we rely upon the contributions of our senior management team to establish and implement our business strategy and to manage the future growth of our business the loss of any of the senior management team could limit our ability to successfully execute our business strategy or adversely affect our ability to retain existing and attract new clients moreover we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team 

across all of our businesses our colleagues are critical to developing and retaining client relationships as well as performing the services on which our revenues are earned it is therefore important for us to attract incentivize and retain significant revenueproducing employees and the key managerial and other professionals who support them we face numerous challenges in this regard including the intense competition for talent the general mobility of colleagues and fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace 

losing colleagues who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements which could adversely affect our results of operations and subject to applicable enforceable restrictive covenants if a key employee were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 

failure to maintain our corporate culture could damage our reputation 

we strive to foster a culture in which our colleagues act with integrity and feel comfortable speaking up about potential misconduct we are a people business and our ability to attract and retain colleagues and clients is dependent upon our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workplace trustworthiness ethical business practices and other qualities our colleagues are the cornerstone of this culture and acts of misconduct by any colleague and particularly by senior management could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients and other stakeholders 

increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors clients and our colleagues with respect to our environmental social and governance esg practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks 

there is increased focus including from governmental organizations investors colleagues and clients on esg issues such as environmental stewardship climate change diversity and inclusion racial justice and workplace conduct negative public perception adverse publicity or negative comments in social media could damage our reputation if we do not or are not perceived to adequately address these issues any harm to our reputation could impact colleague engagement and retention and the willingness of clients and our partners to do business with us 

moreover as we work to align with the recommendations of the financial stability boards task force on climaterelated financial disclosures tcfd the sustainability accounting standards board sasb and our own esg assessments and priorities we expect to expand our public disclosures in these areas including providing additional metrics these metrics whether it be the standards we set for ourselves or a failure to meet these metrics and any failure to achieve progress on our metrics on a timely basis or at all may negatively impact our reputation and our business 

in addition organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to esg matters and unfavorable ratings of our company or our industries may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other companies or industries 

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses including from disintermediation as our competitive landscape continues to evolve 

as a global professional services firm the company faces competition in each of its businesses and the competitive landscape continues to change and evolve our ability to compete successfully depends on a variety of factors including the quality and expertise of our colleagues our geographic reach the sophistication and quality of our services our pricing relative to competitors our clients’ ability to selfinsure or use internal resources instead of consultants and our ability to respond to changes in client demand and industry conditions some of our competitors may have greater financial resources or may be better positioned to respond to technological and other changes in the industries we serve and they may be able to compete more effectively if we are unable to respond successfully to the changing conditions we face our businesses results of operations and financial condition will be adversely impacted 

across our risk and insurance services segment we operate in a variety of markets and face different competitive landscapes in addition to the challenges posed by capital market alternatives to traditional insurance and reinsurance we compete against a wide range of other insurance and reinsurance brokerage and risk advisory firms that operate on a global regional national or local scale for both client business and employee talent in recent years private equity sponsors have invested tens of billions of dollars into the insurance brokerage sector transforming existing players and creating new ones to compete with large brokers we also compete with insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products directly to consumers and without the assistance of brokers or other market intermediaries and with various other companies that provide riskrelated services or alternatives 

to traditional brokerage services including those that rely almost exclusively on technological solutions or platforms this competition is intensified by an often syndicated or distributed approach to the purchase of insurance and reinsurance brokerage services where a client engages multiple brokers to service different portions of the clients account in addition third party capital providers have entered the insurance and reinsurance risk transfer market offering products and capital directly to our clients that serve as substitutes for traditional insurance 

in our consulting segment we compete for business with numerous consulting firms and similar organizations many of whom also provide or are affiliated with firms that provide accounting information systems technology and financial services such competitors may be able to offer more comprehensive products and services to potential clients which may give them a competitive advantage 

in addition companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate or combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients 

we rely on a large number of vendors and other third parties to perform key functions of our business operations and to provide services to our clients these vendors and third parties may act in ways that could harm our business 

we rely on a large number of vendors and other third parties and in some cases subcontractors to provide services data and information such as technology information security funds transfers business process management and administration and support functions that are critical to the operations of our business these third parties include correspondents agents and other brokers and intermediaries insurance markets data providers plan trustees payroll service providers software and system vendors health plan providers investment managers risk modeling providers and providers of human resource functions such as recruiters many of these providers are located outside the us which exposes us to business disruptions and political risks inherent when conducting business outside of the us as we do not fully control the actions of these third parties we are subject to the risk that their decisions or operations may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay in services or operations and additional expense 

a failure by the third parties to i comply with service level agreements in a high quality and timely manner particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services ii maintain adequate internal controls that may impact our own financial reporting or iii adequately maintain the confidentiality of any of our data or trade secrets or adequately protect or properly use other intellectual property to which they may have access could result in economic and reputational harm to us these third parties also face their own technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information or failure to comply with applicable law could cause harm to our reputation or otherwise expose us to liability an interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints noncompliance with legal regulatory or contractual obligations financial difficulties or for any other reason could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in contractual or regulatory penalties liability claims from clients or employees damage to our reputation and harm to our business 

business resiliency risks 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity or data recovery problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

if we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event such as an earthquake hurricane flood terrorist attack pandemic protests or riots security breach cyberattack including manipulating the control systems of critical infrastructure power loss or telecommunications failure our ability to operate will depend in part on the continued availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we could experience operational challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business the risk of business disruption is more pronounced in certain geographic areas including major metropolitan centers like new york or london where we have significant operations and 

approximately 3300 and 5000 colleagues in those respective locations and in certain countries and regions in which we operate that are subject to higher potential threat of terrorist attacks or military conflicts 

our operations depend in particular upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage if a business continuity event occurs we could lose client or company data or experience interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients which could have a material adverse effect such risks have increased significantly due to extended remote work accommodations as a result of covid19 a cyberattack or other business continuity event affecting us or a key vendor or other third party could result in a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or operations or our ability to recover data requiring us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues for example hackers have increasingly targeted companies by attacking internetconnected industrial control and safety control systems an extended outage could result in the loss of clients and a decline in our revenues in the worst case any manipulation of the control systems of critical infrastructure may even result in the loss of life 

we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity disaster recovery and data recovery plans and key management succession however a disaster or other continuity event on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover from such an event could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships and legal liability our business disruption insurance may also not fully cover in type or amount the cost of a successful recovery in the event of such a disruption 

acquisitions and dispositions risks 

we face risks when we acquire businesses 

we have a history of making acquisitions and investments including a total of 132 in the period from 2013 to 2020 we may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses that we acquire into our own business or achieve any expected cost savings or synergies from the integration of such businesses subject to standard contractual protections we may also be responsible for legacy liabilities of companies that we acquire for example upon the consummation of the acquisition of jlt the company assumed the legal liabilities and became responsible for jlt’s litigation and regulatory exposures as of april 1 2019 

in addition if in the future the performance of our reporting units or an acquired business varies from our projections or assumptions or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units or an acquired business change the estimated fair value of our reporting units or an acquired business could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill and other acquisitionrelated intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet or in adjustments in contingent payment amounts given the significant size of the companys goodwill and intangible assets an impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given period 

we expect that acquisitions will continue to be a key part of our business strategy our success in this regard will depend on our ability to identify and compete for appropriate acquisition candidates and to finance and complete the transactions we decide to pursue on favorable terms with positive results 

when we dispose of businesses we may continue to be subject to certain liabilities of that business after its disposition relating to the prior period of our ownership and may not be able to negotiate for limitations on those liabilities we are also subject to the risk that the sales price is less than the amount reflected on our balance sheet 

financial risks 

if we are unable to collect our receivables our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for the work we perform as of december 31 2020 our receivables for our commissions and fees were approximately 47 billion or approximately onequarter of our total annual revenues and portions of our receivables are increasingly concentrated in certain businesses and geographies 

macroeconomic or political conditions such as the impact from covid19 could result in financial difficulties for our clients which could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us 

we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms 

the maintenance and growth of our business including our ability to finance acquisitions the payment of dividends and our ability to make share repurchases rely on our access to capital which depends in large part on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of equity and debt financing certain of our businesses such as gc securities a division of mmc securities llc and mmc securities europe limited also rely on financings by the company to fund the underwriting of their clients debt and equity capital raising transactions we incurred significant debt to finance the jlt transaction and there can be no assurance that our operations will generate sufficient positive cash flow to finance all of our capital needs or that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on favorable terms in addition our ability to obtain financing will depend in part upon prevailing conditions in credit and capital markets which are beyond our control 

our defined benefit pension plan obligations could cause the companys financial position earnings and cash flows to fluctuate 

our defined benefit pension obligations and the assets set aside to fund those obligations are sensitive to certain changes in the financial markets any such changes may result in increased pension expense or additional cash payments to fund these plans 

the company has significant defined benefit pension obligations to its current and former employees including obligations assumed as part of the jlt transaction totaling approximately 199 billion and related plan assets of approximately 191 billion at december 31 2020 on a us gaap basi s as part of the jlt transaction the company assumed responsibility for a number of pension plans throughout the world with 305 million of net pension liabilities as of december 31 2020 1124 million in liabilities and 819 million of plan assets as of december 31 2020 the companys policy for funding its defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth by law in the united states contributions to these plans are based on erisa guidelines outside the united states contributions are generally based on statutory requirements and local funding practices which may differ from measurements under us gaap in the uk for example the assumptions used to determine pension contributions are the result of legallyprescribed negotiations between the company and the plans trustees currently the use of these assumptions results in a lower funded status than determined under us gaap and may result in contributions irrespective of the us gaap funded status 

the financial calculations relating to our defined benefit pension plans are complex pension plan assets could decrease as the result of poor future asset performance in addition the estimated return on plan assets would likely be impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and other factors including equity valuations since these factors reflect the starting point used in the company’s projection models for example a reduction in interest rates may result in a reduction in the estimated return on plan assets also pension plan liabilities periodic pension expense and future funding amounts could increase as a result of a decline in the interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities longer lifespans than those reflected in our mortality assumptions changes in investment markets that result in lower expected returns on assets actual investment return that is less than the expected return on assets adverse changes in laws or regulations and other variables 

while we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of pension volatility on our earnings and cash funding requirements these strategies may not be successful accordingly given the magnitude of our worldwide pension plans variations in or reassessment of the preceding or other factors or potential miscalculations relating to our defined benefit pension plans could cause significant fluctuation from year to year in our earnings and cash flow as well as our pension plan assets liabilities and equity and may result in increased levels of contributions to our pension plans 

our significant nonus operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business 

approximately 53 of our total revenue reported in 2020 was from business outside of the united states we are subject to exchange rate movement because we must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars and also because some of our subsidiaries receive revenue other than in their functional currencies exchange rate movements may change over time and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows reported in us dollars for additional discussion see market risk and credit riskforeign currency risk in part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this report 

our quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly 

quarterly variations in revenues and operating results may occur due to several factors these include 

• the number of client engagements during a quarter 

• the possibility that clients may decide to delay or terminate a current or anticipated project as a result of factors unrelated to our work product or progress 

• fluctuations in hiring and utilization rates and clients ability to terminate engagements without penalty 

• potential limitations on the clients or industries we serve resulting from increased regulation or changing stakeholder expectations on esg issues 

• the impact of changes in accounting standards or in our accounting estimates or assumptions 

• the impact on us or our clients of changes in legislation regulation and legal guidance or interpretations in the jurisdictions in which we operate in particular in the us as a result of the change in presidential administrations 

• seasonality due to the impact of regulatory deadlines policy renewals and other timing factors to which our clients are subject 

• the success of our acquisitions or investments 

• macroeconomic factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates interest rates and global securities markets particularly in the case of mercer where fees in its investments business and certain other business lines are derived from the value of assets under management or administration and 

• general economic conditions including factors beyond our control affecting economic conditions such as covid19 and other global health crisis or pandemics severe weather climate change geopolitical unrest such as protests and riots or other catastrophic events since our results of operations are directly affected by the levels of business activity of our clients which in turn are affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve 

a significant portion of our total operating expenses is relatively fixed in the short term therefore a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results for these businesses 

credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk 

currently the companys senior debt is rated a by sp and baa1 by moodys the company carries a stable outlook with sp and a negative outlook with moodys 

if we need to raise capital in the future for example in order to maintain adequate liquidity fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could limit our access to financing sources we would also face the risk of a credit rating downgrade if we do not retire or refinance the debt to levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies in a timely manner further a downgrade to a rating below investmentgrade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures 

we have significantly increased our debt as a result of the jlt acquisition which could adversely affect our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2020 we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 113 billion in 2019 alone we incurre d 65 billi on of additional debt to finance the jlt acquisition 

the level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility by reducing our cash flows and our ability to use cash from operations for other purposes including working capital dividends to shareholders share repurchases acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate purposes in addition we are subject to risks that at the time any of our outstanding debt matures we will not be able to retire or refinance the debt on terms that are acceptable to us 

the current us tax regime makes our results more difficult to predict 

our effective tax rate may fluctuate in the future as a result of the current us tax regime enacted as part of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the tcja and the continuing issuance of interpretive guidance related to the tcja the tcja included significant changes in us income tax law that has a meaningful impact on our provision for income taxes and requires significant judgments and estimates in interpretation and calculations the enacted tax legislation included among other provisions limitations on the deductibility of net interest a tax on global intangible lowtaxed income gilti and the base erosion and antiabuse tax beat given the significant complexity of the rules and the potential for additional guidance from us treasury the securities and exchange commission the financial accounting standards board or other regulatory authorities recognized impacts in future periods could be significantly different from our current estimates such uncertainty may also result in increased scrutiny from or disagreements with tax authorities in addition the change in the us presidential administrations in january 2021 may increase the chance for legislative changes to the tcja provisions in particular the biden administration has proposed changes to the us statutory tax rate and gilti which would increase the impact of the provision on our results as a usdomiciled company any such increases would have a disproportionate impact on us compared to our foreignbased competitors 

global operations 

we are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations 

we conduct business globally in 2020 approximately 53 of the companys total revenue was generated from operations outside the united states and over onehalf of our employees were located outside the united states the jlt transaction significantly expanded our nonus operations in jurisdictions such as the uk asia south america and australia and we expect to expand our nonus operations further 

the geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal economic operational market compliance and reputational risks these include among others risks relating to 

• economic and political conditions in the countries in which we operate 

• client concentration in certain highgrowth countries in which we operate 

• the length of payment cycles and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable 

• unexpected increases in taxes or changes in us or foreign tax laws rulings policies or related legal and regulatory interpretations including recent international initiatives to require multinational enterprises like ours to report profitability on a countrybycountry basis which could increase scrutiny by or cause disagreements with foreign tax authorities and the potential imposition of new global minimum tax 

• potential transfer pricingrelated tax exposures that may result from the flow of funds among our subsidiaries and affiliates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 

or permanent establishments created due to colleagues traveling to and doing work in countries where the company has no presence and which are not properly compensated through transfer pricing 

• our ability to obtain dividends or repatriate funds from our nonus subsidiaries including as a result of the imposition of currency controls and other government restrictions on repatriation in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the imposition of withholding and other taxes on such payments 

• potential conflicts of interest that may arise as we expand the scope of our businesses and our client base 

• international hostilities international trade disputes terrorist activities natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions 

• local investment or other financial restrictions that foreign governments may impose 

• potential lawsuits investigations market studies reviews or other activity by foreign regulatory or law enforcement authorities or legislatively appointed commissions which may result in potential modifications to our businesses related private litigation or increased scrutiny from us or other regulators 

• potential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including tax systems administered by foreign government agencies some of which may conflict with us or other sources of law 

• potential costs and difficulties in complying or monitoring compliance with foreign and us laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations abroad including trade sanctions laws relating to countries such as cuba crimea iran north korea russia syria and venezuela and anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010 

• limitations or restrictions that foreign or us governments and regulators may impose on the products or services we sell the methods by which we sell our products and services and the manner in which and the amounts we are compensated 

• potential limitations or difficulties in protecting our intellectual property in various foreign jurisdictions 

• limitations that foreign governments may impose on the conversion of currency or the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our nonus subsidiaries 

• engaging and relying on third parties to perform services on behalf of the company and 

• potential difficulties in monitoring employees in geographically dispersed locations 

risks relating to our risk and insurance services segment 

our risk and insurance services segment conducted through marsh and guy carpenter represented 60 of the companys total revenue in 2020 our business in this segment is subject to particular risks 

results in our risk and insurance services segment may be adversely affected by a general decline in economic activity 

demand for many types of insurance and reinsurance generally rises or falls as economic growth expands or slows this dynamic affects the level of commissions and fees generated by marsh and guy carpenter to the extent our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions they may choose to limit their purchases of insurance and reinsurance coverage as applicable which would inhibit our ability to generate commission revenue and other revenue based on premiums placed by us also the insurance they seek to obtain through us may be impacted by changes in their assets property values sales or number of employees which may reduce our commission revenue and they may decide not to purchase our risk advisory or other services which would inhibit our ability to generate fee revenue moreover insolvencies and combinations associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies and combinations in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by limiting our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business as well as our revenues from insurers guy carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the marketplace 

volatility or declines in premiums and other market trends may significantly impede our ability to grow revenues and profitability 

a significant portion of our risk and insurance services revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential 

for changes in premium rates is significant due to the normal cycles of pricing in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

as traditional insurance companies continue to rely on nonaffiliated brokers or agents to generate premium those insurance companies may seek to reduce their expenses by lowering their commission rates the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility or declines in premiums may significantly affect our revenue and profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes it is difficult to accurately forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result we may have to adjust our plans for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by disintermediation and the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their riskprotection needs this trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to selfinsure the use of captive insurers and the presence of capital marketsbased solutions for traditional insurance and reinsurance needs further the profitability of our risk and insurances services segment depends in part on our ability to be compensated for the analytical services and other advice that we provide including the consulting and analytics services that we provide to insurers if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for all of our services our margins and profitability could decline 

adverse legal developments and future regulations concerning how intermediaries are compensated by insurers or clients as well as allegations of anticompetitive behavior or conflicts of interest more broadly could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the ways in which insurance intermediaries are compensated receive scrutiny from regulators in part because of the potential for anticompetitive behavior and conflicts of interest the vast majority of the compensation that marsh receives is in the form of retail fees and commissions that are paid by the client or paid from premium that is paid by the client the amount of other compensation that we receive from insurance companies separate from retail fees and commissions has increased in the last several years both on an underlying basis and through acquisition and represented approximately 5 of marshs revenue in 2020 this other compensation includes payment for i consulting and analytics services provided to insurers ii administrative and other services provided to insurers including services relating to the administration and management of quota shares panels and other facilities and iii contingent commissions primarily at mma and outside the us paid by insurers based on factors such as volume or profitability these other revenue streams present potential regulatory litigation and reputational risks that may arise from alleged anticompetitive behavior or conflicts of interest including those arising from guy carpenter’s role as intermediary and advisor for insurance companies and future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect such revenue adverse regulatory legal or other developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and expose the company to negative publicity and reputational harm 

risks relating to our consulting segment 

our consulting segment conducted through mercer and oliver wyman group represented 40 of our total revenue in 2020 our businesses in this segment are subject to particular risks 

mercer’s investments business is subject to a number of risks including risks related to thirdparty investment managers operational risk conflicts of interest asset performance and regulatory compliance that if realized could result in significant damage to our business 

mercer’s investments business provides clients with investment consulting and investment management services as of december 31 2020 mercer and its global affiliates had assets under management of approximately 357 billion worldwide in the investment consulting business clients make and implement their own investment decisions based upon research prepared or advice provided by mercer in its investment management business mercer implements the client’s investment policy by engaging overseeing and making changes to the thirdparty asset managers who determine which investments to 

buy and sell to effect implementation of a client’s investment policy mercer may utilize its manager of managers investment funds 

mercer’s investments business is subject to a number of risks including risks related to litigation thirdparties our operations conflicts of interest asset performance and regulatory compliance and scrutiny which could arise in connection with these offerings for example mercer’s manager research or due diligence on an asset manager may fail to uncover material deficiencies or fraud that could result in investment losses to a client there is a risk that mercer will fail to properly implement a client’s investment policy or direction which could cause an incorrect or untimely allocation of client assets among asset managers or strategies mercer may also be perceived as recommending certain asset managers to clients or offering delegated solutions to an investment consulting client solely to enhance its own compensation asset classes may perform poorly or asset managers may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance a downturn in the global equity markets negligence or other reasons resulting in poor returns or loss of client capital changes in the value levels of equity debt real assets commodities foreign exchange or other asset markets in particular as a result of a downturn in the global markets may cause our assets under management revenue and earnings to decline these risks if realized could result in significant liability and damage our business 

revenues for the services provided by our consulting segment may decline for various reasons including as a result of changes in economic conditions the value of equity debt and other asset classes our clients’ or an industrys financial condition or government regulation or an accelerated trend away from actively managed investments to passively managed investments 

global economic conditions particularly the impact of covid19 may negatively impact businesses and financial institutions many of our clients including financial institutions corporations government entities and pension plans have reduced expenses including amounts spent on consulting services and used internal resources instead of consultants during difficult economic periods the evolving needs and financial circumstances of our clients may reduce demand for our consulting services and could adversely affect our revenues and profitability if the economy or markets in which we operate experience weakness or deteriorate our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition some of mercers investments business generate fees based upon the value of the clients’ assets under management or advisement changes in the value of equity debt currency real estate commodities or other asset classes could cause the value of assets under management or advisement and the fees received by mercer to decline such changes could also cause clients to withdraw funds from mercer’s investments business in favor of other investment service providers in either case our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected mercer’s investments business also could be adversely affected by an accelerated shift away from actively managed investments to passively managed investments with associated lower fees further revenue received by mercer as investment manager to the majority of the mercermanaged investment funds is reported in accordance with us gaap on a gross basis rather than a net basis with subadvisor fees reflected as an expense therefore the reported revenue for these offerings does not fully reflect the amount of net revenue ultimately attributable to mercer 

demand for many of mercers benefits services is affected by government regulation and tax laws rulings policies and interpretations which drive our clients needs for benefitsrelated services significant changes in government regulations affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of mercers services 

factors affecting defined benefit pension plans and the services we provide relating to those plans could adversely affect mercer 

mercer currently provides corporate trustees multiemployer and public clients with actuarial consulting and administration services relating to defined benefit pension plans the nature of our work is complex many clients particularly in the public sector have sizeable pension deficits and are subject to impact from volatility in the global stock markets and interest rate fluctuations a number of mercers clients have frozen or curtailed their defined benefit plans and have moved to defined contribution plans resulting in reduced revenue for mercers retirement business these developments and a continued or accelerated 

rate of decline in revenues for our defined benefit pension plans business could adversely affect mercers business and operating results in addition our actuarial services involve numerous assumptions and estimates regarding future events including interest rates used to discount future liabilities estimated rates of return for a plans assets healthcare cost trends salary projections and participants life expectancies our consulting services involve the drafting and interpretation of trust deeds and other complex documentation governing pension plans our administration services include calculating benefits within complicated pension plan structures our investments services include investment advice and management relating to defined benefit pension plan assets intended to fund present and future benefit obligations clients dissatisfied with our services have brought and may bring significant claims against us particularly in the united states and the united kingdom 

the profitability of our consulting segment may decline if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and pricing rates for our consultants 

the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on ensuring that our consultants maintain adequate utilization rates ie the percentage of our consultants working hours devoted to billable activities our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

• our ability to transition consultants promptly from completed projects to new assignments and to engage newlyhired consultants quickly in revenuegenerating activities 

• our ability to continually secure new business engagements particularly because a portion of our work is projectbased rather than recurring in nature 

• our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain appropriate headcount in each of our geographies and workforces 

• our ability to retain key colleagues and consulting professionals 

• unanticipated changes in the scope of client engagements 

• the potential for conflicts of interest that might require us to decline client engagements that we otherwise would have accepted 

• our need to devote time and resources to sales training professional development and other nonbillable activities 

• the potential disruptive impact of acquisitions and dispositions and 

• general economic conditions 

if the utilization rate for our consulting professionals declines our profit margin and profitability could decline 

in addition the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on the prices we are able to charge for our services the prices we charge are affected by a number of factors including 

• clients perception of our ability to add value through our services 

• market demand for the services we provide 

• our ability to develop new services and the introduction of new services by competitors 

• the pricing policies of our competitors 

• the extent to which our clients develop inhouse or other capabilities to perform the services that they might otherwise purchase from us and 

• general economic conditions 

if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for our services our profit margin and profitability could decline

income taxes 

the company completed the jlt transaction on april 1 2019 during 2020 the integration of this global organization required intercompany transfers of acquired entities into the companys country structures and the combination of those entities within the equivalent company businesses the integration transactions were designed to be tax efficient the companys global effective tax rate on jlts earnings was reduced compared to jlts preacquisition tax rate by utilizing debt for the restructuring transactions to be capital efficient and reducing the generation of postacquisition tax losses by merging historically unprofitable jlt entities with profitable company operations provisions for deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions were established as part of the purchase price allocation as of april 1 2019 

the broader jlt organization is now held under the companys legal entity structure which makes it part of a usbased multinational company and subjects it to full us taxation 

the companys consolidated effective tax rate was 267 273 and 256 in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the rates in all periods reflect the effects of tax planning and the ongoing impact of the tax cuts and jobs act tcja including regulatory and other guidance as it became available the tax rate in 2020 includes a valuation allowance for certain tax credits the impact of uncertain tax positions and certain tax planning benefits the 2019 rate reflects items related to the jlt acquisition including nondeductible goodwill allocated to the sale of aerospace and nondeductible expenses incurred in relation to the jlt acquisition the 2018 rate includes the effect of a charge related to the company’s investment in af as discussed in note 1 the tax rates in all periods reflect the impact of discrete tax matters tax legislation and nontaxable adjustments to contingent acquisition consideration 

the effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future the effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of the companys earnings which may result in higher or lower tax rates a shift in the mix of profits among jurisdictions can also affect the effective tax rate in 2020 pretax income in barbados canada ireland australia japan and germany accounted for approximately 60 of the companys total nonus pretax income with effective rates in those countries of 1 27 15 23 337 and 32 respectively 

in addition losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate depending on estimates of the value of associated deferred tax assets which can be realized a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax 

assets to the amount that the company believes is more likely than not to be realized details are provided in note 7 of the consolidated financial statements the effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation 

changes in tax laws rulings policies or related legal and regulatory interpretations occur frequently and may also have significant favorable or adverse impacts on our effective tax rate 

as a us domiciled parent holding company the company is the issuer of essentially all of the companys external indebtedness and incurs the related interest expense in the us the company’s interest expense deductions are not currently limited further most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the us and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the us some of these expenses may not be deductible in the us which may impact the effective tax rate 

the quasiterritorial tax regime provides an opportunity for the company to repatriate foreign earnings more tax efficiently and there is less incentive for permanent reinvestment of these earnings however permanent reinvestment continues to be a component of the company’s global capital strategy the company continues to evaluate its global investment and repatriation strategy in light of our capital requirements and potential costs of repatriation 

the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act was signed into law on march 27 2020 the cares act provided over 2 trillion in economic relief to individuals governmental agencies and companies to deal with the public health and economic impacts of covid19 pursuant to the cares act payroll taxes due from march 27 2020 through december 31 2020 will be deferred until 2021 and 2022 50 to be paid each year without interest or penalties

management’s discussion of critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the company’s 

financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from those estimates 

revenue recognition 

in the risk and insurance services segment judgments related to the amount of variable revenue consideration to ultimately be received on placement of quota share reinsurance treaties and contingent commission from insurers which was previously recognized when the contingency was resolved now requires significant judgments and estimates 

the company capitalizes the incremental costs to obtain contracts primarily related to commissions or sales bonus payments these deferred costs are amortized over the expected life of the underlying customer relationships the company also capitalizes certain preplacement costs that are considered fulfillment costs that are amortized at a point in time when the associated revenue is recognized 

management also makes significant judgments and estimates to measure the progress toward completing performance obligations and realization rates for consideration related to contracts as well as potential performancebased fees in the consulting segment 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

legal and other loss contingencies 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions eo gaap requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance the company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel an internal actuarial analysis by oliver wyman a subsidiary of the company and other methods to estimate potential losses the liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable given the unpredictability of eo claims and of litigation that could flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the company’s businesses results of operations financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period 

in addition to the extent that insurance coverage is available significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the company’s various insurance programs 

retirement benefits 

the company maintains qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible us employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible nonus employees the company’s policy for funding its taxqualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable foreign laws 

the company recognizes the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci net of tax in the company’s consolidated balance sheets the gains and losses that exceed specified corridors 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the marketrelated value of plan assets are amortized prospectively out of aoci over a period that approximates the remaining life expectancy of participants in plans where substantially all participants are inactive or the average remaining service period of active participants for plans with active participants the vast majority of unrecognized losses relate to inactive plans and are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the participants 

the determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate mortality and assumed rate of salary increase the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are 

disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements the assumptions for expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate are discussed in more detail below 

the longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption is determined for each plan based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of the measurement date and the specific portfolio mix of each plan’s assets the company utilizes a model developed by mercer a subsidiary of the company to assist in the determination of this assumption the model takes into account several factors including actual and target portfolio allocation investment administrative and trading expenses incurred directly by the plan trust historical portfolio performance relevant forwardlooking economic analysis and expected returns variances and correlations for different asset classes these measures are used to determine probabilities using standard statistical techniques to calculate a range of expected returns on the portfolio 

the target asset allocation for the us plans is 64 equities and equity alternatives and 36 fixed income at the end of 2020 the actual allocation for the us plans was 64 equities and equity alternatives and 36 fixed income the target asset allocation for the uk plans which comprise approximately 81 of nonus plan assets is 32 equities and equity alternatives and 68 fixed income at the end of 2020 the actual allocation for the uk plans was 33 equities and equity alternatives and 67 fixed income 

the discount rate selected for each us plan is based on a model bond portfolio with coupons and redemptions that closely match the expected liability cash flows from the plan discount rates for nonus plans are based on appropriate bond indices adjusted for duration in the uk the plan duration is reflected using the mercer yield curve 

the table below shows the weighted average assumed rate of return and the discount rate at the december 31 2020 measurement date for measuring pension expense in 2021 for the total company the us and the rest of world row 



holding all other assumptions constant a halfpercentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the us and uk plans which together comprise approximately 85 of total pension plan liabilities as follows 



the impact of discount rate changes shown above relates to the increase or decrease in actuarial gains or losses being amortized through net periodic pension cost as well as the increase or decrease in interest expense with all other facts and assumptions held constant it does not contemplate nor include potential future impacts a change in the interest rate environment and discount rates might cause such as the impact on the market value of the plans’ assets in addition the assumed return on plan assets would likely be impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and other factors including equity valuations since these factors reflect the starting point used in the company’s projection models for example a reduction in interest rates may result in a reduction in the assumed return on plan assets changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant also may not be representative of the impact on expense because the longterm rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost 

the company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees the cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the us is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire but is funded by the company as incurred the key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions the company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the evaluation of a tax position is a twostep process 

• first the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on only the technical merits of the position if a tax position does not meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements 

• the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue 

the company recognizes interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense the company’s accounting policy follows the portfolio approach that leaves stranded income tax effects in aoci 

certain items are included in the companys tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as nondeductible expenses and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities which are measured at existing tax rates deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements the company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company also considers tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carry back of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law the underlying assumptions the company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the companys recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carryforwards are deductible or creditable valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction

the jlt transaction had a significant impact on the company’s results of operations in 2020 the company believes that in addition to the change in reported gaap revenue a comparison of 2020 gaap reported revenue to the combined 2019 revenue of mmc and jlt as if the companies were combined on january 1 2019 provides investors with meaningful information as to the company’s yearoveryear underlying operating results investors should not consider the comparison of these nongaap measures in isolation from or as a substitute for the financial information that the company reports in accordance with gaap 

the 2019 including jlt revenue information set forth in the table below presents revenue information as if the companies were combined on january 1 2019 and is not necessarily indicative of what the results would have been had we operated the business since january 1 2019

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk and credit risk 

certain of the company’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets 

interest rate risk and credit risk 

interest income generated from the company’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates 

the company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates 



based on the above balances if shortterm interest rates increased or decreased by 10 or 3 basis points over the full year annual interest income including interest earned on fiduciary funds would increase or decrease by approximately 2 million 

in addition to interest rate risk our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counterparty credit risk to minimize this risk the company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a board approved investment policy the policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counterparty limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment the company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions the majority of cash and fiduciary fund investments are invested in shortterm bank deposits and liquid money market funds 

foreign currency risk 

the translated values of revenue and expense from the company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates the nonus based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 53 of total revenue we periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business although the company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location as such under normal circumstances the us dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the us dollar generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk however there have been periods where the impact was not mitigated due to external market factors and external macroeconomic events may result in greater foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future if foreign exchange rates of major currencies euro sterling australian dollar and canadian dollar moved 10 in the same direction against the us dollar compared with the foreign exchange rates in 2020 the company estimates net operating income would increase or decrease by approximately 39 million the company has exposure to approximately 80 foreign currencies overall in continental europe the largest amount of revenue from renewals for the risk  insurance services segment occurs in the first quarter 

equity price risk 

the company holds investments in both public and private companies as well as private equity funds including investments of approximately 72 million that are valued using readily determinable fair values and approximately 33 million of investments without readily determinable fair values the company also has investments of approximately 280 million that are a ccounted for using the equity method the investments are subject to risk of decline in market value which if determined to be other than temporary for assets without readily determinable fair values could result in realized impairment losses the 

company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements 

at december 31 2020 the company owns approximately 14 of the common stock of af a south african company listed on the johannesburg stock exchange the investment in af is accounted at fair value with unrealiz ed gains and losses recorded as investment income in the consolidated statement of income the fair value of this investment at december 31 2020 was approximately 54 million

regulation 

the companys activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under us federal and state laws as well as laws of other countries in which the companys subsidiaries operate see part i item 1a risk factors below for a discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our businesses 

risk and insurance services  while laws and regulations vary from location to location every state of the united states and most foreign jurisdictions require insurance market intermediaries and related service providers such as insurance brokers agents and consultants reinsurance brokers and managing general agents to hold an individual or company license from a government agency or selfregulatory organization some jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locallyowned business entities in those instances if the company has no licensed subsidiary it may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction such arrangements are subject to an internal review and approval process licensing of reinsurance intermediaries is generally less rigorous compared to that of insurance brokers and most jurisdictions require only corporate reinsurance intermediary licenses 

in 2005 the insurance mediation directive which as from october 1 2018 has been superseded by the insurance distribution directive was adopted by the united kingdom and 27 other european union member states its implementation gave powers to the financial services authority fsa the united kingdom regulator at the time to expand its responsibilities in line with the financial services and 

markets act 2000 the result of which was the regulation of insurance and reinsurance intermediaries the enhanced regulatory regime implemented in the united kingdom created a licensing system based on an assessment of factors which included professional competence financial capacity and the requirement to hold professional indemnity insurance in april 2013 the fsa was superseded by the financial conduct authority fca in april 2014 the fca’s responsibilities were expanded further to include the regulation of credit activities for consumers this included the broking of premium finance to consumers who wished to spread the cost of their insurance in april 2015 the fca obtained concurrent competition powers enabling it to enforce prohibitions on anticompetitive behavior in relation to financial services 

insurance authorities in the united states and certain other jurisdictions in which the companys subsidiaries do business including the fca in the united kingdom also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others these laws and regulations typically provide for segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them and generally apply to both the insurance and reinsurance business 

certain of the companys risk and insurance services activities are governed by other regulatory bodies such as investment securities and futures licensing authorities in the united states marsh and guy carpenter use the services of mmc securities llc a sec registered brokerdealer in the united states investment adviser and introducing broker mmc securities llc is a member of the financial industry regulatory authority finra the national futures association and the securities investor protection corporation sipc primarily in connection with capital markets and other investment bankingrelated services relating to insurancelinked and alternative risk financing transactions also in the united states marsh uses the services of mma securities llc a sec registered brokerdealer investment adviser and member of finra and sipc and jsl securities inc a sec registered brokerdealer and member of finra sipc and the municipal securities rulemaking board primarily in connection with retirement executive compensation and benefits consulting and advisory services to qualified and nonqualified benefits plans companies and executives in the united kingdom marsh and guy carpenter use the expertise of mmc securities europe limited which is authorized and regulated by the fca to provide advice on securities and investments including mergers  acquisitions in the european union mmc securities llc mmc securities europe limited mma securities llc and jsl securities inc are indirect whollyowned subsidiaries of marsh  mclennan companies inc 

consulting  mercers retirementrelated consulting and investment services are subject to pension law and financial regulation in many countries in addition the trustee services investment services including advice to persons institutions and other entities on the investment of pension assets and assumption of discretionary investment management responsibilities and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services provided by mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are also subject to investment and securities regulations in various jurisdictions including regulations imposed or enforced by the sec and the department of labor in the united states the fca in the united kingdom the central bank of ireland and the australian prudential regulation authority and the australian securities and investments commission in the united states mercer provides investment services through mercer investments llc formerly mercer investment management inc an secregistered investment adviser which consolidated the activities of each of mercer’s affiliated investment adviser entities in the united states including mercer investment consulting llc and pavilion advisory group earlier in 2019 mercer trust company a limited purpose new hampshire chartered trust bank may also provide services for certain clients of mercer’s investment management business in the united states the benefits insurance consulting and brokerage services provided by mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to the same licensing requirements and regulatory oversight as the insurance market intermediaries described above regarding our risk and insurance services businesses mercer uses the services of mmc securities llc to provide certain services including executive benefit and compensation services and securities dealing services 

fatca  regulations promulgated by the us treasury department pursuant to the foreign account tax compliance act and related legislation fatca require the company to take various measures relating to nonus funds transactions and accounts the regulations impose on mercer certain client financial account tracking and disclosure obligations with respect to nonus financial institution and insurance 

clients and until recently required marsh and guy carpenter and mercer in limited circumstances to collect validate and maintain certain documentation from each foreign insurance entity that insures a risk that is subject to the regulations on december 13 2018 the us treasury department modified these rules effectively relieving marsh and guy carpenter from fatca compliance with respect to its handling of noncash value premium payments as it relates to these noncash value insurance premiums the new rules were put into immediate effect 

competitive conditions

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information presented in this report these risks have the potential to materially adversely affect the companys business results of operations or financial condition 

risks relating to the company generally 

technology cybersecurity and data protection risks 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to develop and implement improvements in technology or respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological change 

we depend in large part on our technology systems for conducting business as well as for providing the data and analytics we utilize to manage our business as a result our business success is dependent on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and on continuing to develop and enhance technology systems that support our business processes and strategic initiatives in a cost and resource efficient manner particularly as our business processes become more digital we have a number of strategic initiatives involving investments in or partnerships with technology companies as well as investments in technology systems and infrastructure to support our growth strategy these investments may be costly and require significant capital expenditures may not be profitable or may be less profitable than what we have experienced historically in addition investments in technology systems may not deliver the benefits or perform as expected or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected which could result in operational difficulties or additional costs in some cases we also depend on key vendors and partners to provide technology and other support for our strategic initiatives if these vendors or partners fail to perform their obligations or otherwise cease to work with us our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected if we do not keep up with technological changes or execute effectively on our strategic initiatives our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

in addition to remain competitive in many of our business areas we must anticipate and respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological change the threat comes from traditional players such as insurers through disintermediation as well as from new entrants such as technology companies insurtech startup companies and others these players are focused on using technology and innovation including artificial intelligence ai digital platforms data analytics robotics and blockchain to simplify and improve the client experience increase efficiencies alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the industries in which we operate 

we could incur significant liability or our reputation could be damaged if our information systems are breached or we otherwise fail to protect client or company data or information systems 

in operating our business and providing services and solutions to clients we collect use store transmit and otherwise process certain electronic information including personal confidential proprietary and sensitive data such as information related to financial records health care mergers and acquisitions and personal data of our clients colleagues and vendors we rely on the efficient uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business and securely process transmit and store electronic information in the normal course of business we also share electronic information with our vendors and other third parties this electronic information comprises sensitive and confidential data including information related to financial records health care mergers and acquisitions and clients’ personal data our information technology systems and safety control systems and those of our numerous thirdparty providers as well as the control systems of critical infrastructure they rely on such as power grids are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access damage or interruption from a variety of external threats including cyberattacks computer viruses and other malware ransomware and other types of data and systemsrelated modes of attack our systems are also subject to compromise from internal threats such as improper action by employees vendors and other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems moreover we face the ongoing challenge of managing access controls in a complex environment the latency of a compromise is often measured in months but could be years and we may not be able to detect a compromise in a timely manner we could experience significant financial and reputational harm if our information systems are breached sensitive client or company data are compromised surreptitiously modified rendered 

inaccessible for any period of time or maliciously made public or if we fail to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public or law enforcement agencies following any such event whether due to delayed discovery or a failure to follow existing protocols 

cyberattacks are increasing in frequency and evolving in nature we are at risk of attack by a variety of adversaries including statesponsored organizations organized crime hackers or hactivists activist hackers through use of increasingly sophisticated methods of attack including the deployment of artificial intelligence to find and exploit vulnerabilities such as “deep fakes” and longterm persistent attacks referred to as advanced persistent threats these techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems include among other things computer viruses malicious or destructive code ransomware social engineering attacks including phishing and impersonation hacking and denialofservice attacks because these techniques change frequently and new techniques may not be identified until they are launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures resulting in potential data loss data unavailability data corruption or other damage to information technology systems 

as the breadth and complexity of the technologies we use and the software and platforms we develop continue to grow including as a result of the use of mobile devices cloud services open source software social media and the increased reliance on devices connected to the internet known as the internet of things the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks also increases despite ongoing efforts to improve our ability to protect data from compromise we may not be able to protect all of our data across our diverse systems our efforts to improve and protect data from compromise may also identify previously undiscovered instances of security breaches or other cyber incidents our policies employee training including phishing prevention training procedures and technical safeguards may also be insufficient to prevent or detect improper access to confidential personal or proprietary information in addition the competition for talent in the data privacy and cybersecurity space is intense and we may also be unable to hire develop or retain suitable talent capable of adequately detecting mitigating or remediating these risks 

should an attacker gain access to our network using compromised credentials of an authorized user we are at risk that the attacker might successfully leverage that access to compromise additional systems and data certain measures that could increase the security of our systems such as data encryption including encryption of data at rest heightened monitoring and logging scanning for source code errors or deployment of multifactor authentication take significant time and resources to deploy broadly and such measures may not be deployed in a timely manner or be effective against an attack the inability to implement maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our information systems must be continually updated patched and upgraded to protect against known vulnerabilities the volume of new software vulnerabilities has increased markedly as has the criticality of patches and other remedial measures including those in the existing jlt information systems in addition to remediating newly identified vulnerabilities previously identified vulnerabilities must also be continuously addressed accordingly we are at risk that cyberattackers exploit these known vulnerabilities before they have been communicated by vendors or addressed due to the large number and age of the systems and platforms that we operate the increased frequency at which vendors are issuing security patches to their products the need to test patches and in some cases coordinate with clients and vendors before they can be deployed we perpetually face the substantial risk that we cannot deploy patches in a timely manner we are also dependent on third party vendors to keep their systems patched and secure in order to protect our data any failure related to these activities could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we have numerous vendors and other third parties who receive personal information from us in connection with the services we offer our clients in addition we have migrated certain data and may increasingly migrate data to the cloud hosted by thirdparty providers some of these vendors and third parties also have direct access to our systems we are at risk of a cyberattack involving a vendor or other third party which could result in a breakdown of such third party’s data protection processes or the cyberattackers gaining access to our infrastructure through the third party to the extent that a vendor or third party suffers a cyberattack that compromises its operations we could incur significant costs and possible service interruption which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have a history of making acquisitions and investments and in april 2019 we completed the acquisition of jlt the process of integrating the information systems of jlt and of such other businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk for instance we may not adequately identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities in an acquired entity’s information systems either before or after the acquisition which could affect the value we are able to derive from the acquisition expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to a cyberattack in addition if we discover a historical compromise security breach or other cyber incident related to the target’s information systems following the close of the acquisition we may be liable and exposed to significant costs and other unforeseen liabilities we may also be unable to integrate the systems of the businesses we acquire into our environment in a timely manner which could further increase these risks until such integration takes place in the case of jlt our integration of the information systems is ongoing and given the size and complexity of the integration project we remain exposed to these risks until the integration is complete 

we have from time to time experienced data incidents and cybersecurity breaches such as malware incursions including computer viruses and ransomware users exceeding their data access authorization employee misconduct and incidents resulting from human error such as loss of portable and other data storage devices or misconfiguration of software or hardware resulting in inadvertent exposure of personal sensitive confidential or proprietary information like many companies we are subject to social engineering attacks such as regular phishing email campaigns directed at our employees that can result in malware infections and data loss although these incidents have resulted in data loss and other damages to date they have not had a material adverse effect on our business or operations in the future these types of incidents could result in personal sensitive confidential or proprietary information being lost or stolen surreptitiously modified rendered inaccessible for any period of time or maliciously made public including client employee or company data which could have a material adverse effect on our business in the event of a cyberattack we might have to take our systems offline which could interfere with services to our clients or damage our reputation we also may be unable to detect an incident assess its severity or impact or appropriately respond in a timely manner in addition our liability insurance which includes cyber insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches cyberattacks and other related data and system incidents 

the costs to comply with or our failure to comply with us and foreign laws related to privacy data security and data protection such as the eu general data protection regulation gdpr and the california consumer privacy act ccpa could adversely affect our financial condition operating results and our reputation 

in operating our business and providing services and solutions to clients we store and transfer sensitive employee and client data including personal data in and across multiple jurisdictions we leverage systems and applications that are spread all over the world requiring us to regularly move data across national borders as a result we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states europe and around the world regarding privacy data protection data security and cybersecurity these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing some of these laws and regulations are increasing the level of data handling restrictions including rules on data localization all of which could affect our operations and result in regulatory liability and high fines in particular highprofile security breaches at major companies continue to be disclosed regularly which is leading to even greater regulatory scrutiny and fines at the highest levels they have ever been 

the scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting for example the gdpr which became effective in may 2018 greatly increased the european commission’s jurisdictional reach of its laws and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data such as the public disclosure of data breaches privacy impact assessments data portability and the appointment of data protection officers in some cases in the us the ccpa came into effect in january 2019 and introduced several new concepts to local privacy requirements including increased transparency and rights such as access and deletion and an ability to opt out of the “sale” of personal information despite a proliferation of regulatory guidance papers much remains unclear with respect to how to interpret and implement the gdpr and the ccpa and that lack of clarity could result in potential liability for our failure to meet our obligations under the gdpr and the ccpa given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations including classifying data and committing to a range 

of administrative technical and physical controls to protect data and enable data transfers outside of the eu our compliance with laws such as the gdpr and the ccpa will continue to require time resources and review of the technology and systems we use further brexit has created uncertainty with regard to the future of the flow of personal information between the united kingdom and the eu and that uncertainty may impair our ability to offer our existing and planned products and services or increase our cost of doing business 

following the implementation of the gdpr other jurisdictions have sought to amend or propose legislation to amend their existing data protection laws to align with the requirements of the gdpr with the aim of obtaining an adequate level of data protection to facilitate the transfer of personal data to most jurisdictions from the eu accordingly the challenges we face in the eu will likely also apply to other jurisdictions that adopt laws similar to the gdpr or regulatory frameworks of equivalent complexity for example brazil has enacted its general data protection law the lei geral de proteção de dados pessoais which is due to come into effect in august 2020 china has modified its law india has a new draft privacy law and japan has adopted sweeping changes to its privacy law in some cases including china and india the laws include data localization elements that will require that certain personal data stay within their borders looking at the us following the passage of the ccpa multiple other states have introduced similar bills some more comprehensive than the ccpa there is also continued legislative interest in passing a federal privacy law in addition to data protection laws countries and states in the us are enacting cybersecurity laws and regulations for example the new york state department of financial services issued in 2017 cybersecurity regulations which imposed an array of detailed security measures on covered entities these requirements were phased in and the last of them came into effect on march 1 2019 all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time may divert resources from other initiatives and projects and could restrict the way services involving data are offered all of which may adversely affect our results of operations 

many statutory requirements both in the united states and abroad include obligations for companies to notify individuals of security breaches involving certain personal information which could result from breaches experienced by us or our vendors in addition to government regulation privacy advocates and industry groups have and may in the future propose selfregulatory standards from time to time these and other industry standards may legally or contractually apply to us or we may elect to comply with such standards we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws and regulations concerning data privacy and security and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws regulations and standards may have on our business 

furthermore enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase unauthorized disclosure or transfer of sensitive or confidential client or company data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation by the company our vendors or other parties with whom we do business if they fail to meet the standards we impose could subject us to significant litigation monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines and criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions given the complexity of operationalizing the various privacy laws such as the gdpr and the ccpa the maturity level of proposed compliance frameworks and the continued lack of clarity on how to implement their requirements we and our clients are at risk of enforcement actions taken by eu and other data protection authorities or litigation from consumer advocacy groups acting on behalf of data subjects we may not be able to respond quickly or effectively to regulatory legislative and other developments and these changes may in turn impair our ability to offer our existing or planned products and services andor increase our cost of doing business 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from errors and omissions breach of fiduciary duty and other claims 

our businesses provide numerous professional services including the placement of insurance and the provision of consulting investment advisory and actuarial services to clients around the world as a result the company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of errors and omissions breach of fiduciary duty and similar claims which we refer to collectively as eo claims in our risk and 

insurance services segment such claims include allegations of damages arising from our failure to assess clients’ risks advise clients place coverage or notify insurers of potential claims on behalf of clients in accordance with our obligations to them in our consulting segment where we increasingly act in a fiduciary capacity through our investments business such claims could include allegations of damages arising from the provision of consulting investments actuarial pension administration and other services we may also be exposed to claims related to assets or solutions offered by the consulting segment in complement to its traditional consulting services these consulting segment services frequently involve complex calculations and other analysis including i making assumptions about and preparing estimates concerning contingent future events ii drafting and interpreting complex documentation governing pension plans iii calculating benefits within complex pension structures iv providing individual financial planning advice including investment advice and advice relating to cashing out of defined benefit pension plans v providing investment advice including guidance on asset allocation and investment strategy and vi managing client assets including the selection of investment managers and implementation of the client’s investment policy we provide these services to a broad client base including clients in the public sector for our investment services matters often relate to services provided by the company dating back many years such claims may subject us to significant liability for monetary damages including punitive and treble damages negative publicity and reputational harm and may divert personnel and management resources we may be unable to effectively limit our potential liability in certain jurisdictions including through insurance or in connection with certain types of claims particularly those concerning claims of a breach of fiduciary duty 

in establishing liabilities for eo claims under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap the company uses case level reviews by inside and outside counsel actuarial analysis by oliver wyman group a subsidiary of the company and other methods to estimate potential losses a liability is established when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable the liability is assessed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable given the judgment involved in estimating and establishing liabilities in accordance with us gaap as well as the unpredictability of eo claims and the litigation that can flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations or financial condition 

we are subject to regulatory investigations reviews and other inquiries that consume significant management time and if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are subject to regulatory investigations reviews and other inquiries that consume significant management time and if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition for example in october 2017 the company received a notice that the directorategeneral for competition of the european commission had commenced a civil investigation of a number of insurance brokers including both marsh and jlt regarding the exchange of commercially sensitive information between competitors in relation to aviation and aerospace insurance and reinsurance broking products and services in the european economic area as well as possible coordination between competitors in january 2019 we received a notice that the administrative council for economic defense antitrust agency in brazil had commenced an administrative proceeding against a number of insurance brokers including both marsh and jlt and insurers “to investigate an alleged sharing of sensitive commercial and competitive confidential information” in the aviation insurance and reinsurance sector in addition upon the consummation of the acquisition of jlt the company assumed the legal liabilities and became responsible for jlt’s litigation and regulatory exposures as of april 1 2019 

these regulatory matters are ongoing and we are unable to predict their likely timing outcome or ultimate impact additional information regarding these investigations and certain other legal and regulatory proceedings is set forth in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item 8 of this report 

we cannot guarantee that we are or will be in compliance with all current and potentially applicable us federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states and its various states the united kingdom the european union and its member states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate for example we are subject to regulation by agencies such as the securities and exchange commission finra and state insurance regulators in the united states the fca and the competition and markets authority cma in the united kingdom and the european commission in the european union as further described above under part i item 1  business regulation of this report we are also subject to trade sanctions laws relating to countries such as cuba crimea iran north korea russia syria and venezuela and anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk antibribery act we are subject to numerous other laws on matters as diverse as internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures securities regulation data privacy and protection cybersecurity taxation antitrust and competition immigration wageandhour standards and employment and labor relations 

the us and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our operations are complex and may change rapidly and our efforts to comply and keep up with them require significant resources in some cases these laws and regulations may decrease the need for our services increase our costs negatively impact our revenues or impose operational limitations on our business including on the products and services we may offer or on the amount or type of compensation we may collect while we attempt to comply with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we our employees our consultants and our contractors and other agents are in full compliance with such laws and regulations or interpretations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws or regulations if we fail to comply or are accused of failing to comply with applicable laws and regulations including those referred to above we may become subject to investigations criminal penalties civil remedies or other consequences including fines injunctions loss of an operating license or approval increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in a particular business or redress to clients or other parties and we may become exposed to negative publicity or reputational damage moreover our failure to comply with laws or regulations in one jurisdiction may result in increased regulatory scrutiny by other regulatory agencies in that jurisdiction or regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions the cost of compliance and the consequences of failing to be in compliance could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in most jurisdictions government regulatory authorities have the power to interpret and amend or repeal applicable laws and regulations and have discretion to grant renew and revoke the various licenses and approvals we need to conduct our activities such authorities may require the company to incur substantial costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations in some areas of our businesses we act on the basis of our own or the industrys interpretations of applicable laws or regulations which may conflict from state to state or country to country in the event those interpretations eventually prove different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities we may be penalized or precluded from carrying on our previous activities moreover the laws and regulations to which we are subject may conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate which increases the likelihood of our businesses being noncompliant in one or more jurisdictions 

our business or reputation could be harmed by our reliance on thirdparty providers or introducers 

we currently partner with a large volume of thirdparty providers to meet the needs of our clients around the world in certain limited instances we also work with thirdparty introducers that provide services for public sector clients 

there is a risk that our thirdparty providers or introducers engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies or violate applicable laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk antibribery act 

acquisitions and dispositions risks 

we face risks when we acquire businesses including risks relating to our integration of jlt 

we have a history of making acquisitions and investments including a total of 123 in the period from 2013 to 2019 in particular we completed the acquisition of the jardine lloyd thompson group plc jlt on april 1 2019 the “jlt transaction” we may not be able to successfully integrate the business of jlt or any other businesses that we acquire into our own business or achieve any expected cost savings or synergies from the integration of jlt or any other such integration the potential difficulties that we may face which could cause the results of the acquisition of jlt or any other business to differ from our expectations include but are not limited to the following 

 in addition if in the future the performance of our reporting units or an acquired business varies from our projections or assumptions or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units or an acquired business change the estimated fair value of our reporting units or an acquired business could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill and other acquisitionrelated intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet or in adjustments in contingent payment amounts given the significant size of the companys goodwill and intangible assets an impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given period 

we expect that acquisitions will continue to be a key part of our business strategy our success in this regard will depend on our ability to identify and compete for appropriate acquisition candidates and to finance and complete the transactions we decide to pursue on favorable terms with positive results 

when we dispose of businesses we may continue to be subject to certain liabilities of that business after its disposition relating to the prior period of our ownership and may not be able to negotiate for limitations on those liabilities we are also subject to the risk that the sales price is less than the amount reflected on our balance sheet 

competitive risks 

the loss of members of our senior management team or other key colleagues could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we rely upon the contributions of our senior management team to establish and implement our business strategy and to manage the future growth of our business the loss of any of the senior management team could limit our ability to successfully execute our business strategy or adversely affect our ability to retain existing and attract new clients moreover we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team 

across all of our businesses our colleagues are critical to developing and retaining client relationships as well as performing the services on which our revenues are earned it is therefore important for us to attract incentivize and retain significant revenueproducing employees and the key managerial and other professionals who support them we face numerous challenges in this regard including the intense competition for talent the general mobility of colleagues and fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace 

losing colleagues who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements which could adversely affect our results of operations and subject to applicable enforceable restrictive covenants if a key employee were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 

failure to maintain our corporate culture could damage our reputation 

we strive to foster a culture in which our colleagues act with integrity and feel comfortable speaking up about potential misconduct we are a people business and our ability to attract and retain colleagues and clients is dependent upon our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workplace trustworthiness ethical business practices and other qualities our colleagues are the cornerstone of this culture and acts of misconduct by any colleague and particularly by senior management could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients and other stakeholders 

in addition there is increased focus including from governmental organizations investors colleagues and clients on environmental social and governance esg issues such as climate change our reputation could be damaged if we do not or are perceived not to adequately address these issues 

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses including from disintermediation as our competitive landscape continues to evolve 

as a global professional services firm the company faces intense sustained competition in each of its businesses and the competitive landscape continues to change and evolve our ability to compete successfully depends on a variety of factors including the quality and expertise of our colleagues our geographic reach the sophistication and quality of our services our pricing relative to competitors our clients’ ability to selfinsure or use internal resources instead of consultants and our ability to respond to changes in client demand and industry conditions some of our competitors may have greater financial resources or may be better positioned to respond to technological and other changes in the industries we serve and they may be able to compete more effectively if we are unable to respond successfully to the changing conditions we face our businesses results of operations and financial condition will be adversely impacted 

in our risk and insurance services segment in addition to the challenges posed by capital market alternatives to traditional insurance and reinsurance we compete intensely against a wide range of other insurance and reinsurance brokerage and risk advisory firms that operate on a global regional national or local scale for both client business and employee talent in recent years private equity sponsors have invested tens of billions of dollars into the insurance brokerage sector transforming existing players and creating new ones to compete with large global and regional brokers we also compete with inhouse brokers captive insurance companies insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service 

their insurance products directly to consumers and without the assistance of brokers or other market intermediaries and with various other companies that provide riskrelated services or alternatives to traditional brokerage services including those that rely almost exclusively on technological solutions or platforms this competition is intensified by an often syndicated or distributed approach to the purchase of insurance and reinsurance brokerage services where a client engages multiple brokers to service different portions of the clients account in addition third party capital providers have entered the insurance and reinsurance risk transfer market offering products and capital directly to our clients that serve as substitutes for traditional insurance 

in our consulting segment we compete for business with numerous consulting firms and similar organizations many of whom also provide or are affiliated with firms that provide accounting information systems technology and financial services such competitors may be able to offer more comprehensive products and services to potential clients which may give them a competitive advantage 

consolidation in the industries we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate or combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work any of these or similar possible results of increasing or evolving industry consolidation could adversely affect our business for example as insurance and reinsurance companies continue to consolidate guy carpenter’s smaller client base may be more susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the marketplace in addition in our consulting segment in australia mercer faces increased competitive pressure as the superannuation industry is consolidating and superannuation providers such as mercer face increased downward pressure on fees 

we rely on a large number of vendors and other third parties to perform key functions of our business operations and to provide services to our clients these vendors and third parties may act in ways that could harm our business 

we rely on a large number of vendors and other third parties and in some cases subcontractors to provide services data and information such as technology information security funds transfers business process management and administration and support functions that are critical to the operations of our business these third parties include correspondents agents and other brokers and intermediaries insurance markets data providers plan trustees payroll service providers software and system vendors health plan providers investment managers risk modeling providers and providers of human resource functions such as recruiters many of these providers are located outside the us which exposes us to business disruptions and political risks inherent when conducting business outside of the us as we do not fully control the actions of these third parties we are subject to the risk that their decisions or operations may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay in services or operations and additional expense 

a failure by the third parties to i comply with service level agreements in a high quality and timely manner particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services ii maintain adequate internal controls that may impact our own financial reporting or iii adequately maintain the confidentiality of any of our data or trade secrets or adequately protect or properly use other intellectual property to which they may have access could result in economic and reputational harm to us these third parties also face their own technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information or failure to comply with applicable law could cause harm to our reputation or otherwise expose us to liability an interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints noncompliance with legal regulatory or contractual obligations financial difficulties or for any other reason could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in contractual or regulatory penalties liability claims from clients or employees damage to our reputation and harm to our business 

business resiliency risks 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity or data recovery problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

if we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event such as an earthquake hurricane flood terrorist attack pandemic security breach cyberattack including manipulating the control systems of critical infrastructure power loss or telecommunications failure our ability to operate will depend in part on the continued availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we could experience operational challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business the risk of business disruption is more pronounced in certain geographic areas including major metropolitan centers like new york or london where we have significant operations and approximately 3300 and 5200 colleagues in those respective locations and in certain countries and regions in which we operate that are subject to higher potential threat of terrorist attacks or military conflicts 

our operations depend in particular upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage if a business continuity event occurs we could lose client or company data or experience interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients which could have a material adverse effect a cyberattack or other business continuity event affecting us or a key vendor or other third party could result in a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or operations or our ability to recover data requiring us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues for example hackers have increasingly targeted companies by attacking internetconnected industrial control and safety control systems an extended outage could result in the loss of clients and a decline in our revenues in the worst case any manipulation of the control systems of critical infrastructure may even result in the loss of life 

we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity disaster recovery and data recovery plans and key management succession however a disaster or other continuity event on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover from such an event could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships and legal liability our business disruption insurance may also not fully cover in type or amount the cost of a successful recovery in the event of such a disruption 

financial risks 

our results of operations and investments could be adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions political events and market conditions 

macroeconomic conditions political events and other market conditions around the world affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve these conditions may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing for those services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations changes in macroeconomic and political conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have a competitive advantage and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain 

the united kingdom’s exit from the european union referred to as brexit continues to create political and economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom and the european union the british government and the eu continue to negotiate the terms of the uks future relationship with the eu there remains inevitable uncertainty on topics such as financial laws and regulations tax and free trade agreements immigration laws and employment laws we have significant operations and a substantial workforce in the uk approximately 16 of our revenue is from the uk and the uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of brexit may cause increased economic volatility affecting our operations and business the effects of brexit will depend on the agreements the uk makes to retain access to european union markets during a transitional period and more permanently the measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose clients and colleagues in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which european union laws to replace or replicate these developments may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of financial markets both in the uk and 

globally any of these factors could affect the demand for our services furthermore currency exchange rates in gbp and the euro with respect to each other and the us dollar have already been adversely affected by these developments should this foreign exchange volatility continue it could cause volatility in our quarterly financial results 

in addition any changes in us trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries resulting in “trade wars” which could affect the volume of economic activity and performance of stock markets in the united states including demand for our services 

our investments including our minority investments in other companies as well as our cash investments and those held in a fiduciary capacity are subject to general credit liquidity counterparty foreign exchange market and interest rate risks these risks may be exacerbated by global macroeconomic conditions market volatility and regulatory financial and other difficulties affecting the companies in which we have invested or that may be faced by financial institution counterparties during times of stress in the banking industry counterparty risk can quickly escalate potentially resulting in substantial trading and investment losses for corporate and other investors in addition we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may continue to experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels if the banking system or the fixed income interest rate credit or equity markets deteriorate the value and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected finally the value of the companys assets held in other jurisdictions including cash holdings may decline due to foreign exchange fluctuations 

if we are unable to collect our receivables our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for the work we perform as of december 31 2019 our receivables for our commissions and fees were approximately 46 billion or approximately onequarter of our total annual revenues and portions of our receivables are increasingly concentrated in certain businesses and geographies 

macroeconomic or political conditions could result in financial difficulties for our clients which could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us 

we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms 

the maintenance and growth of our business including our ability to finance acquisitions the payment of dividends and our ability to make share repurchases rely on our access to capital which depends in large part on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of equity and debt financing certain of our businesses such as gc securities a division of mmc securities llc and mmc securities europe limited also rely on financings by us to fund their underwriting of debt and equity capital raising offerings by their clients we incurred significant debt to finance the jlt transaction and there can be no assurance that our operations will generate sufficient positive cash flow to finance all of our capital needs or that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on favorable terms in addition our ability to obtain financing will depend in part upon prevailing conditions in credit and capital markets which are beyond our control 

our defined benefit pension plan obligations could cause the companys financial position earnings and cash flows to fluctuate 

our defined benefit pension obligations and the assets set aside to fund those obligations are sensitive to certain changes in the financial markets any such changes may result in increased pension expense or additional cash payments to fund these plans 

the company has significant defined benefit pension obligations to its current and former employees including obligations assumed as part of the jlt transaction totaling approximately 176 billion and related plan assets of approximately 170 billion at december 31 2019 on a us gaap basis as part of the jlt transaction the company assumed responsibility for a number of pension plans throughout the world with 255 million of net pension liabilities as of december 31 2019 1003 million in liabilities and 748 million of plan assets as of december 31 2019 the companys policy for funding its defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set 

forth by law in the united states contributions to these plans are based on erisa guidelines outside the united states contributions are generally based on statutory requirements and local funding practices which may differ from measurements under us gaap in the uk for example the assumptions used to determine pension contributions are the result of legallyprescribed negotiations between the company and the plans trustees currently the use of these assumptions results in a lower funded status than determined under us gaap and may result in contributions irrespective of the us gaap funded status 

the financial calculations relating to our defined benefit pension plans are complex pension plan assets could decrease as the result of poor future asset performance in addition the estimated return on plan assets would likely be impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and other factors including equity valuations since these factors reflect the starting point used in the company’s projection models for example a reduction in interest rates may result in a reduction in the estimated return on plan assets also pension plan liabilities periodic pension expense and future funding amounts could increase as a result of a decline in the interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities longer lifespans than those reflected in our mortality assumptions changes in investment markets that result in lower expected returns on assets actual investment return that is less than the expected return on assets adverse changes in laws or regulations and other variables 

while we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of pension volatility on our earnings and cash funding requirements these strategies may not be successful accordingly given the magnitude of our worldwide pension plans variations in or reassessment of the preceding or other factors or potential miscalculations relating to our defined benefit pension plans could cause significant fluctuation from year to year in our earnings and cash flow as well as our pension plan assets liabilities and equity and may result in increased levels of contributions to our pension plans 

our significant nonus operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business 

approximately 53 of our business is located outside of the united states we are subject to exchange rate movement because we must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars and also because some of our subsidiaries receive revenue other than in their functional currencies exchange rate movements may change over time and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows reported in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in certain jurisdictions however while risk and insurance services operations generate revenue in a number of different currencies expenses are almost entirely incurred in local currency due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we are subject to economic exposure as well as currency translation exposure on the net operating results of our operations because the nonus based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 53 of total revenue exchange rate movement can have a significant impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow for additional discussion see market risk and credit riskforeign currency risk in part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this report 

we may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

the company is organized as a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries because we do not have significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations paying dividends to stockholders repurchasing our common stock under our share repurchase program and paying corporate expenses in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and make other payments to the company we may not be able to service our debt pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock or meet our other obligations 

further the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the united states funds from the current year’s earnings of the companys nonus operating subsidiaries are regularly repatriated to the united states a number of factors could arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or could make repatriation costprohibitive including but not limited to the imposition of currency controls and other government restrictions on repatriation in 

the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the imposition of withholding and other taxes on such payments 

in the event we are unable to generate or repatriate cash from our operating subsidiaries our overall liquidity could deteriorate and our ability to finance our obligations including to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock could be adversely affected 

our quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly 

quarterly variations in revenues and operating results may occur due to several factors these include 

 a significant portion of our total operating expenses is relatively fixed in the short term therefore a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results for these businesses 

credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk 

currently the companys senior debt is rated a by sp and baa1 by moodys the ratings from both sp and moodys currently carry a negative outlook 

if we need to raise capital in the future for example in order to fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could limit our access to financing sources further a downgrade to a rating below investmentgrade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures 

we have significantly increased our debt as a result of the jlt acquisition which could adversely affect our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2019 we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 120 billion in 2019 alone we incurred 65 billion of additional debt to finance the jlt acquisition 

the level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility by reducing our cash flows and our ability to use cash from operations for other purposes including working capital dividends to shareholders share repurchases acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate purposes in addition we are subject to risks that at the time any of our outstanding debt matures we will not be able to retire or refinance the debt on terms that are acceptable to us we also face the risk of a credit rating downgrade if we do not retire or refinance the debt to levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies in a timely manner 

the ongoing effects from the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act continue to make our results more difficult to predict 

our effective tax rate may fluctuate in the future as a result of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the tcja and the continuing issuance of interpretive guidance related to the tcja the tcja included significant changes in us income tax law that has a meaningful impact on our provision for income taxes and requires significant judgments and estimates in interpretation and calculations given the significant complexity of the tcja the potential for new legislation or additional guidance from us treasury the securities and exchange commission the financial accounting standards board or other regulatory authorities related to the tcja recognized impacts in future periods could be significantly different from our current estimates such uncertainty may also result in increased scrutiny from or disagreements with tax authorities 

the enacted tax legislation included among other provisions a reduction in the corporate tax rate new limitations on the deductibility of net interest a tax on global intangible lowtaxed income gilti and the base erosion and antiabuse tax beat with respect to gilti we are experiencing relatively high effective tax rates on our foreign source earnings because of the limitation on foreign tax credits on income already subject to tax rates higher than the us rate the provision continues to be subject to regulatory guidance and possible legislative changes which make predicting its impact on our tax rate difficult in addition the interaction of gilti with the interest expense limitations may negatively impact our effective tax rate also due to the lack of court cases testing the tcja and related regulations it cannot be certain that we will not be subject to the beat the beat levies a significant tax on cross border payments to related group companies while we operate in a manner that currently limits our exposure to beat uncertainty about the financial impact on us of this tax remains and there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to material amounts of beat in the future 

global operations 

we are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations 

we conduct business globally in 2019 approximately 53 of the companys total revenue was generated from operations outside the united states and over onehalf of our employees were located outside the united states the jlt transaction significantly expanded our nonus operations in jurisdictions such as the uk asia south america and australia and we expect to expand our nonus operations further 

the geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal economic operational market compliance and reputational risks these include among others risks relating to 



 risks relating to our risk and insurance services segment 

our risk and insurance services segment conducted through marsh and guy carpenter represented 57 of the companys total revenue in 2019 our business in this segment is subject to particular risks 

results in our risk and insurance services segment may be adversely affected by a general decline in economic activity 

demand for many types of insurance and reinsurance generally rises or falls as economic growth expands or slows this dynamic affects the level of commissions and fees generated by marsh and guy carpenter to the extent our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions they may choose to limit their purchases of insurance and reinsurance coverage as applicable which would inhibit our ability to generate commission revenue and other revenue based on premiums placed by us also the insurance they seek to obtain through us may be impacted by changes in their assets property values sales or number of employees which may reduce our commission revenue and they may decide not to purchase our risk advisory or other services which would inhibit our ability to generate fee revenue moreover insolvencies and combinations associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies and combinations in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by limiting our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business as well as our revenues from insurers guy carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the marketplace 

volatility or declines in premiums and other market trends may significantly impede our ability to grow revenues and profitability 

a significant portion of our risk and insurance services revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based our revenues and profitability are 

subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to the normal cycles of pricing in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

as traditional insurance companies continue to rely on nonaffiliated brokers or agents to generate premium those insurance companies may seek to reduce their expenses by lowering their commission rates the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility or declines in premiums may significantly affect our revenue and profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes it is difficult to accurately forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result we may have to adjust our plans for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by disintermediation and the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their riskprotection needs this trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to selfinsure the use of captive insurers and the presence of capital marketsbased solutions for traditional insurance and reinsurance needs further the profitability of our risk and insurances services segment depends in part on our ability to be compensated for the analytical services and other advice that we provide including the consulting and analytics services that we provide to insurers if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for all of our services our margins and profitability could decline 

adverse legal developments and future regulations concerning how intermediaries are compensated by insurers or clients as well as allegations of anticompetitive behavior or conflicts of interest more broadly could have a material adverse effect on marsh’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the ways in which insurance intermediaries are compensated receive scrutiny from regulators in part because of the potential for anticompetitive behavior and conflicts of interest the vast majority of the compensation that marsh receives is in the form of retail fees and commissions that are paid by the client or paid from premium that is paid by the client the amount of other compensation that we receive from insurance companies separate from retail fees and commissions has increased in the last several years both on an underlying basis and through acquisition this other compensation includes payment for i consulting and analytics services provided to insurers ii administrative and other services provided to insurers including services relating to the administration and management of quota shares panels and other facilities and iii contingent commissions primarily at mma and outside the us paid by insurers based on factors such as volume or profitability these other revenue streams present potential regulatory litigation and reputational risks that may arise from alleged anticompetitive behavior or conflicts of interest and future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect such revenue adverse regulatory legal or other developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and expose the company to negative publicity and reputational harm 

risks relating to our consulting segment 

our consulting segment conducted through mercer and oliver wyman group represented 43 of our total revenue in 2019 our businesses in this segment are subject to particular risks 

mercer’s investments business is subject to a number of risks including risks related to thirdparty investment managers operational risk conflicts of interest asset performance and regulatory compliance that if realized could result in significant damage to our business 

mercer’s investments business provides clients with investment consulting and investment management also referred to as delegated solutions or fiduciary management services in the investment consulting business clients make and implement their own investment decisions based upon advice provided by mercer in its delegated solutions business mercer implements the client’s investment policy by engaging and overseeing thirdparty asset managers who determine which investments to buy and sell to effect implementation of a client’s investment policy mercer may utilize its manager of managers investment funds 

mercer’s investments business is subject to a number of risks including risks related to thirdparties our operations conflicts of interest asset performance and regulatory compliance and scrutiny which could arise in connection with these offerings for example mercer’s due diligence on an asset manager may fail to uncover material deficiencies or fraud that could result in investment losses to a client there is a risk that mercer will fail to properly implement a client’s investment policy which could cause an incorrect or untimely allocation of client assets among asset managers or strategies mercer may also be perceived as recommending certain asset managers to clients or offering delegated solutions to an investment consulting client solely to enhance its own compensation asset classes may perform poorly or asset managers may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance a downturn in the global equity markets negligence or other reasons resulting in poor returns or loss of client capital changes in the value levels of equity debt real assets commodities foreign exchange or other asset markets in particular as a result of a downturn in the global markets may cause our assets under management revenue and earnings to decline these risks if realized could result in significant liability and damage our business 

revenues for the services provided by our consulting segment may decline for various reasons including as a result of changes in economic conditions the value of equity debt and other asset markets our clients’ or an industrys financial condition or government regulation or an accelerated trend away from actively managed investments to passively managed investments 

global economic conditions may negatively impact businesses and financial institutions many of our clients including financial institutions corporations government entities and pension plans have reduced expenses including amounts spent on consulting services and used internal resources instead of consultants during difficult economic periods the evolving needs and financial circumstances of our clients may reduce demand for our consulting services and could adversely affect our revenues and profitability if the economy or markets in which we operate experience weakness or deteriorate our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition some of mercers investments business generate fees based upon the value of the clients’ assets under management or advisement changes in the value of equity debt currency real estate commodities or other asset classes could cause the value of assets under management or advisement and the fees received by mercer to decline such changes could also cause clients to withdraw funds from mercer’s investments business in favor of other investment service providers in either case our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected mercer’s investments business also could be adversely affected by an accelerated shift away from actively managed investments to passively managed investments with associated lower fees further revenue received by mercer as investment manager to the majority of the mercermanaged investment funds is reported in accordance with us gaap on a gross basis rather than a net basis with subadvisor fees reflected as an expense therefore the reported revenue for these offerings does not fully reflect the amount of net revenue ultimately attributable to mercer 

demand for many of mercers benefits services is affected by government regulation and tax laws rulings policies and interpretations which drive our clients needs for benefitsrelated services significant changes in government regulations affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of mercers services 

factors affecting defined benefit pension plans and the services we provide relating to those plans could adversely affect mercer 

mercer currently provides corporate trustees multiemployer and public clients with actuarial consulting and administration services relating to defined benefit pension plans the nature of our work is complex many clients particularly in the public sector have sizeable pension deficits and are subject to impact from volatility in the global stock markets and interest rate fluctuations a number of mercers clients have frozen or curtailed their defined benefit plans and have moved to defined contribution plans resulting in reduced revenue for mercers retirement business these developments and a continued or accelerated rate of decline in revenues for our defined benefit pension plans business could adversely affect mercers business and operating results in addition our actuarial services involve numerous assumptions and estimates regarding future events including interest rates used to discount future liabilities estimated 

rates of return for a plans assets healthcare cost trends salary projections and participants life expectancies our consulting services involve the drafting and interpretation of trust deeds and other complex documentation governing pension plans our administration services include calculating benefits within complicated pension plan structures our investments services include investment advice and management relating to defined benefit pension plan assets intended to fund present and future benefit obligations clients dissatisfied with our services have brought and may bring significant claims against us particularly in the united states and the united kingdom 

the profitability of our consulting segment may decline if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and pricing rates for our consultants 

the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on ensuring that our consultants maintain adequate utilization rates ie the percentage of our consultants working hours devoted to billable activities our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 if the utilization rate for our consulting professionals declines our profit margin and profitability could decline 

in addition the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on the prices we are able to charge for our services the prices we charge are affected by a number of factors including 

 if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for our services our profit margin and profitability could decline

these funds the increase in interest expense was primarily due to new debt issuances related to the jlt acquisition 

investment income 

the caption investment income in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments it includes when applicable otherthantemporary declines in the value of securities marktomarket increasesdecreases in equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity method gains or losses on its investments in private equity funds the companys investments may include direct investments in insurance consulting or other strategically linked companies and investments in private equity funds 

as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements effective january 1 2018 the company prospectively adopted a new accounting standard that requires equity investments except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income the company holds certain equity investments that under legacy us gaap were previously treated as available for sale securities whereby the marktomarket change was recorded to other comprehensive income in its consolidated balance sheet the company recorded a cumulativeeffect adjustment increase to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption of 14 million reflecting the reclassification of cumulative unrealized gains net of tax as of december 31 2017 from other comprehensive income to retained earnings prior periods have not been restated

income taxes 

as noted above on april 1 2019 the company completed the jlt transaction the integration of this global organization required intercompany transfers of acquired entities into the companys country structures and combination of those entities within the equivalent company businesses the integration transactions were designed to be tax efficient the companys global effective tax rate on jlts earnings was reduced compared to jlts preacquisition tax rate by utilizing debt for the restructuring transactions to be capital efficient and reducing the generation of postacquisition tax losses by merging historically unprofitable jlt entities with profitable company operations the provisions for deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions have been established as part of the purchase price allocation as of april 1 2019 

the broader jlt organization is now held under the company which makes it part of a usbased multinational company and subjects it to full us taxation 

in 2017 the tax reform legislation known as the tax cuts and jobs act the tcja significantly changed the us federal income tax regime it provided for a reduction in the us corporate tax rate to 21 and the creation of a quasiterritorial system to tax nonus based operations including adding a minimum tax on global intangible lowtaxed income gilti the tcja also changed the deductibility of certain expenses primarily meals and entertainment executive officers’ compensation and interest as further discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2017 the company recorded a provisional charge of 460 million related to the enactment of the tcja and this provisional charge was finalized in 2018 state treatment of certain tcja provisions is still evolving 

the companys consolidated effective tax rate was 273 256 and 429 in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the rates in 2019 and 2018 reflect ongoing impacts of the tcja primarily the reduced 21 us statutory tax rate and certain tax planning benefits largely offset by higher us tax costs under the quasiterritorial system greater disallowance of compensation and entertainment deductions a decrease in excess tax benefits related to share compensation primarily due to the lower us tax rate lower federal benefit for state taxes and treatment by states of certain tcja provisions the 2019 rate reflects items related to the jlt acquisition including nondeductible goodwill allocated to the sale of aerospace 

and nondeductible expenses incurred in relation to the jlt acquisition the 2018 rate includes the effect of a charge related to the company’s investment in alexander forbes as discussed in note 10 the tax rates in all periods reflect the impact of discrete tax matters tax legislation and nontaxable adjustments to contingent acquisition consideration 

the effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future the effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of the companys earnings which may result in higher or lower tax rates thus a shift in the mix of profits among jurisdictions can affect the effective tax rate in 2019 pretax income in barbados canada australia ireland germany the uk and bermuda accounted for approximately 60 of the companys total nonus pretax income with effective rates in those countries of 1 28 32 14 29 105 and 1 respectively 

in addition losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate depending on estimates of the value of associated deferred tax assets which can be realized a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that the company believes is more likely than not to be realized the details are provided in note 7 of the consolidated financial statements the effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation 

changes in tax laws rulings policies or related legal and regulatory interpretations occur frequently and may also have significant favorable or adverse impacts on our effective tax rate 

as a us domiciled parent holding company the company is the issuer of essentially all of the companys external indebtedness and incurs the related interest expense in the us the company’s interest expense deductions are not currently limited further most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the us and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the united states some of these expenses may not be deductible in the us which may impact the effective tax rate 

the quasiterritorial tax regime provides an opportunity for the company to repatriate foreign earnings more tax efficiently and there is less incentive for permanent reinvestment of these earnings however permanent reinvestment continues to be a component of the company’s global capital strategy the company revised its permanent reinvestment assertion related to accumulated earnings that were subject to the 2017 transition tax of the tcja to facilitate repatriation of most of those accumulated earnings for post2017 years including 2019 the company continues to evaluate its global investment and repatriation strategy in light of our capital requirements considering the tcja and the quasiterritorial tax regime for future foreign earnings 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company is organized as a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries as the company does not have significant operations of its own the company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt obligations pay dividends to stockholders repurchase its shares and pay corporate expenses the company can also provide financial support to its operating subsidiaries for acquisitions investments and certain parts of their business that require liquidity such as the capital markets business of guy carpenter other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows 

the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the united states funds from those operating subsidiaries are regularly repatriated to the united states out of annual earnings at december 31 2019 the company had approximately 10 billion of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations which includes 178 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements the company expects to continue its practice of repatriating available funds from its nonus operating subsidiaries out of current annual earnings where appropriate a portion of the current year earnings will continue to be permanently reinvested with respect to repatriating 2018 and prior earnings the company has evaluated such factors as its short and longterm capital needs acquisition and borrowing strategies and the availability of cash for repatriation for each of its subsidiaries the company has determined that in general its permanent reinvestment assertions in light of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act should allow the company to repatriate previously taxed earnings from the deemed repatriations as cash becomes available 

during 2019  the company recorded foreign currency translation adjustments which increased net equity by 151 million  continued weakening of the us dollar against foreign currencies would further increase the translated us dollar value of the company’s net investments in its nonus subsidiaries as well as the translated us dollar value of cash repatriations from those subsidiaries 

cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the company 

operating cash flows 

the company generated 24 billion of cash from operations in both 2019 and 2018  these amounts reflect the net income of the company during those periods excluding gains or losses from investments adjusted for noncash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments of accrued liabilities or receipts of assets and pension contributions 

pensionrelated items 

contributions 

during 2019  the company contributed 35 million to its us pension plans and 87 million to nonus pension plans compared to contributions of 30 million to us plans and 82 million to nonus plans in 2018 

in the united states contributions to the taxqualified defined benefit plans are based on erisa guidelines and the company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80 or more of the liability determined under the erisa guidelines in 2019 the company made 31 million of contributions to its nonqualified plans and 4 million to plans acquired in the jlt acquisition the company expects to contribute approximately 76 million to its us pension plans in 2020 including 47 million to the us qualified plans to meet erisa funding requirements and 29 million for its nonqualified plans 

the company contributed 27 million to the uk plans in 2019  including an expense allowance of approximately 10 million the companys contributions to the uk plans in 2020 are expected to be approximately 39 million including an expense allowance of 10 million 

outside the united states the company has a large number of nonus defined benefit pension plans the largest of which are in the uk which comprise approximately 81 of nonus plan assets at december 31 2019 contribution rates for nonus plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements which may differ significantly from measurements under us gaap in the uk the assumptions used to determine pension contributions are the result of legallyprescribed negotiations between the company and the plans trustee that typically occur every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans currently this results in a lower funded status than under us gaap and may result in contributions irrespective of the us gaap funded status for the mmc uk pension fund a new agreement was reached with the trustee in the fourth quarter of 2019 based on the surplus funding position at december 31 2018 under the agreement no deficit funding is required until 2023 the funding level will be reassessed during 2022 to determine if contributions are required in 2023 as part of a longterm strategy which depends on having greater influence over asset allocation and overall investment decisions in november 2019 the company renewed its agreement to support annual deficit contributions by the uk operating companies under certain circumstances up to gbp 450 million over a sevenyear period in addition in the uk the company assumed responsibility for jlts pension scheme jlt uk plan deficit funding of approximately 28 million is expected during 2020 with a new funding agreement expected to be reached with the trustee during 2020 

in the aggregate the company expects to contribute approximately 84 million to its nonus defined benefit plans in 2020 comprising approximately 45 million to plans outside of the uk and 39 million to the uk plans

benefit section which was frozen to future accruals in 2006 and a defined contribution section the assets of the jlt uk plan are held in a trustee administered fund separate from the company 

changes in funded status and expense 

the yearoveryear change in the funded status of the companys pension plans is impacted by the difference between actual and assumed results particularly with regard to return on assets and changes in the discount rate as well as the amount of company contributions if any unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately 21 billion and 31 billion at december 31 2019 for the us plans and nonus plans respectively compared with losses of 19 billion and 26 billion at december 31 2018 the increases in both the us and nonus plans was primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities partly offset by an increase in asset values in the past several years the amount of unamortized losses has been significantly impacted both positively and negatively by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities in 2019 decreased in the us and uk the companys largest plans following increases in the us and the uk in 2018 the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities decreased in 2017 an increase in the discount rate decreases the measured plan benefit obligation resulting in actuarial gains while a decrease in the discount rate increases the measured plan obligation resulting in actuarial losses during 2019 the companys defined benefit pension plan assets had gains of 214 and 131 in the us and uk respectively as compared to losses of 74 and 10 in the us and uk respectively in 2018 during 2017 the companys defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 193 in the us and 91 in the uk 

overall based on the measurement at december 31 2019 total benefit credits related to the company’s defined benefit plans are expected to decrease in 2020 by approximately 5 million compared to 2019 reflecting a decrease in nonus plans of approximately 8 million offset by an increase in us plans of 3 million

management’s discussion of critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from those estimates 

purchase price allocation 

assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business acquisition are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition the excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill the jlt transaction has increased the significance of judgments and estimates management must make to complete the purchase price allocation determining fair value of identifiable assets particularly intangibles and liabilities acquired also requires management to make estimates which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset these estimates directly impact the amount of identified intangible assets recognized and the related amortization expense in future periods 

revenue recognition 

the adoption of the new revenue standard on january 1 2018 has increased the significance of judgments and estimates management must make to apply the guidance in particular in the risk and insurance services segment judgments related to the amount of variable revenue consideration to ultimately be received on placement of quota share reinsurance treaties and contingent commission from insurers which was previously recognized when the contingency was resolved now requires significant judgments and estimates 

under the new standard certain costs to obtain or fulfill a contract that were previously expensed as incurred have been capitalized the company capitalizes the incremental costs to obtain contracts primarily related to commissions or sales bonus payments these deferred costs are amortized over the expected life of the underlying customer relationships the company also capitalizes certain preplacement costs that are considered fulfillment costs that are amortized at a point in time when the associated revenue is recognized 

management also makes significant judgments and estimates to measure the progress toward completing performance obligations and realization rates for consideration related to contracts as well as potential performancebased fees in the consulting segment 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

legal and other loss contingencies 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions eo gaap requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance the company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel an internal actuarial analysis by oliver wyman group a subsidiary of the company and other methods to estimate potential losses the liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable given the unpredictability of eo claims and of litigation that could flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the company’s businesses results of operations financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period 

in addition to the extent that insurance coverage is available significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the company’s various insurance programs 

retirement benefits 

the company maintains qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible us employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible nonus employees the company’s policy for funding its taxqualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable foreign laws 

the company recognizes the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci net of tax in the company’s consolidated balance sheets the gains and losses that exceed specified corridors are amortized prospectively out of aoci over a period that approximates the remaining life expectancy of participants in plans where substantially all participants are inactive or the average remaining service period of active participants for plans with active participants the vast majority of unrecognized losses relate to inactive plans and are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the participants 

the determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate mortality and assumed rate of salary increase the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements the assumptions for expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate are discussed in more detail below 

the longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption is determined for each plan based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of the measurement date and the specific portfolio mix of each plan’s assets the company utilizes a model developed by mercer a subsidiary of the company to assist in the determination of this assumption the model takes into account several factors including actual and target portfolio allocation investment administrative and trading expenses incurred directly by the plan trust historical portfolio performance relevant forwardlooking economic analysis and expected returns variances and correlations for different asset classes these measures are used to determine probabilities using standard statistical techniques to calculate a range of expected returns on the portfolio 

the target asset allocation for the us plans is 64 equities and equity alternatives and 36 fixed income at the end of 2019  the actual allocation for the us plans was 64 equities and equity alternatives and 36 fixed income the target asset allocation for the uk plans which comprise approximately 81 of nonus plan assets is 34 equities and equity alternatives and 66 fixed income at the end of 2019  the actual allocation for the uk plans was 35 equities and equity alternatives and 65 fixed income 

the discount rate selected for each us plan is based on a model bond portfolio with coupons and redemptions that closely match the expected liability cash flows from the plan discount rates for nonus plans are based on appropriate bond indices adjusted for duration in the uk the plan duration is reflected using the mercer yield curve 

the table below shows the weighted average assumed rate of return and the discount rate at the december 31 2019 measurement date for measuring pension expense in 2020 for the total company the us and the rest of world row 



holding all other assumptions constant a halfpercentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the us and uk plans which together comprise approximately 85 of total pension plan liabilities as follows 



the impact of discount rate changes shown above relates to the increase or decrease in actuarial gains or losses being amortized through net periodic pension cost as well as the increase or decrease in interest expense with all other facts and assumptions held constant it does not contemplate nor include potential future impacts a change in the interest rate environment and discount rates might cause such as the impact on the market value of the plans’ assets in addition the assumed return on plan assets would likely be impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and other factors including equity valuations since these factors reflect the starting point used in the company’s projection models for example a reduction in interest rates may result in a reduction in the assumed return on plan assets changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant also may not be representative of the impact on expense because the longterm rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost 

the company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees the cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the us is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire but is funded by the company as incurred the key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions the company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the evaluation of a tax position is a twostep process 

 the company recognizes interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

certain items are included in the companys tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as nondeductible expenses and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities which are measured at existing tax rates deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the 

financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements the company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company also considers tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carryback of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law the underlying assumptions the company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the companys recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carryforwards are deductible or creditable valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction 

fair value determinations 

goodwill impairment testing – the company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred the company performs the annual impairment assessment for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year in accordance with applicable accounting guidance a company can assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a goodwill impairment test alternatively the company may elect to proceed directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test in 2019 the company elected to perform a quantitative impairment assessment fair values of the reporting units were estimated using a market approach carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level the company completed its 2019 annual review in the third quarter and concluded goodwill was not impaired as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin 

sharebased payment 

the guidance for accounting for sharebased payments requires among other things that the estimated grant date fair value of stock options be charged to earnings significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values in addition management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards as defined by the accounting guidance 

as of december 31 2019 there was  19 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards the weightedaverage period over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 125 years also as of december 31 2019 there was  357 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the company’s restricted stock restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards the weightedaverage period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is approximately 111 years

in connection with the jlt transaction the company entered into several derivative contracts described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements these derivative contracts are recorded at fair value at the end of each period with the change in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of income prior to the settlement determination of the fair value of these contracts in particular the deal contingent foreign exchange contract required significant management judgments or estimates about the potential closing dates of the transaction and remaining value of the deal contingency feature all derivative contracts related to the jlt transaction were settled during 2019 

new accounting pronouncements

reconciliation of nongaap measures 

on april 1 2019 the company completed its previously announced acquisition of jlt jlts results of operations for the three months ended december 31 2019 are included in the company’s results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2019 jlts results of operations from april 1 2019 are included in the companys results of operations for the twelve monthperiod ended december 31 2019 prior periods in 2018 do not include jlt’s results prior to being acquired by the company jlt operated in three segments specialty reinsurance and employee benefits as of april 1 2019 the historical jlt businesses were combined into mmc operations as follows jlt specialty is included by geography within marsh jlt reinsurance is included within guy carpenter and the majority of the jlt employee benefits business is included in mercer health and wealth 

the jlt transaction had a significant impact on the company’s results of operations in 2019 the company believes that in addition to the change in reported gaap revenue a comparison of 2019 gaap reported revenue to the combined 2018 revenue of mmc and jlt as if the companies were combined on april 1 2018 provides investors with meaningful information as to the company’s yearoveryear underlying operating results investors should not consider the comparison of these nongaap measures in isolation from or as a substitute for the financial information that the company reports in accordance with gaap

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk and credit risk 

certain of the company’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets 

interest rate risk and credit risk 

interest income generated from the company’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates 

the company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates   



based on the above balances if shortterm interest rates increased or decreased by 10 or 15 basis points over the full year annual interest income including interest earned on fiduciary funds would increase or decrease by approximately 8 million 

in addition to interest rate risk our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counterparty credit risk to minimize this risk the company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a board approved investment policy the policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counterparty limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment the company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions the majority of cash and fiduciary fund investments are invested in shortterm bank deposits and liquid money market funds 

foreign currency risk 

the translated values of revenue and expense from the company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates the nonus based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 53 of total revenue we periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business although the company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location as such under normal circumstances the us dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the us dollar generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk however there have been periods where the impact was not mitigated due to external market factors and external macroeconomic events such as the impact of brexit in the united kingdom may result in greater foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future if foreign exchange rates of major currencies euro sterling australian dollar and canadian dollar moved 10 in the same direction against the us dollar compared with the foreign exchange rates in 2019  the company estimates net operating income would increase or decrease by approximately 53 million the company has exposure to approximately 85 foreign currencies overall in continental europe the largest amount of revenue from renewals for the risk  insurance services segment occurs in the first quarter 

equity price risk

the company holds investments in both public and private companies as well as private equity funds including investments of approximately 19 million that are valued using readily determinable fair values and approximately 67 million of investments without readily determinable fair values the company also has investments of approximately 434 million that are accounted for using the equity method including the companys investment in alexander forbes the investments are subject to risk of decline in market value which if determined to be other than temporary for assets without readily determinable fair values could result in realized impairment losses the company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements 

the company owns approximately 34 of the common stock of alexander forbes a south african company listed on the johannesburg stock exchange which it purchased in 2014 for 750 south african rand per share in the third quarter of 2018 the company concluded the decline in value of the investment was other than temporary and recorded an impairment charge of  83 million in 2018 as of december 31 2019  the carrying value of the company’s investment in alexander forbes was approximately  144 million  as of december 31 2019  the market value of the approximately 443 million shares of alexander forbes owned by the company based on the december 31 2019 closing share price of 555 south african rand per share was approximately 173 million  see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the pending sale of the companys remaining investment in af

regulation 

the companys activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under us federal and state laws as well as laws of other countries in which the companys subsidiaries operate see part i item 1a risk factors below for a discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our businesses 

risk and insurance services  while laws and regulations vary from location to location every state of the united states and most foreign jurisdictions require insurance market intermediaries and related service providers such as insurance brokers agents and consultants reinsurance brokers and managing general agents to hold an individual or company license from a government agency or selfregulatory organization some jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locallyowned business entities in those instances if the company has no licensed subsidiary it may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction such arrangements are subject to an internal review and approval process licensing of reinsurance intermediaries is generally less rigorous compared to that of insurance brokers and most jurisdictions require only corporate reinsurance intermediary licenses 

in 2005 the insurance mediation directive which as from october 1 2018 has been superseded by the insurance distribution directive was adopted by the united kingdom and 26 other european union member states its implementation gave powers to the financial services authority fsa the united 

kingdom regulator at the time to expand their responsibilities in line with the financial services and markets act 2000 the result of which was the regulation of insurance and reinsurance intermediaries the enhanced regulatory regime implemented in the united kingdom created a licensing system based on an assessment of factors which included professional competence financial capacity and the requirement to hold professional indemnity insurance in april 2013 the fsa was superseded by the financial conduct authority fca in april 2014 the fca’s responsibilities were expanded further to include the regulation of credit activities for consumers this included the broking of premium finance to consumers who wished to spread the cost of their insurance in april 2015 the fca obtained concurrent competition powers enabling it to enforce prohibitions on anticompetitive behavior in relation to financial services 

insurance authorities in the united states and certain other jurisdictions in which the companys subsidiaries do business including the fca in the united kingdom also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others these laws and regulations typically provide for segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them and generally apply to both the insurance and reinsurance business 

certain of the companys risk and insurance services activities are governed by other regulatory bodies such as investment securities and futures licensing authorities in the united states marsh and guy carpenter use the services of mmc securities llc a sec registered brokerdealer in the united states investment adviser and introducing broker mmc securities llc is a member of the financial industry regulatory authority finra the national futures association and the securities investor protection corporation sipc primarily in connection with capital markets and other investment bankingrelated services relating to insurancelinked and alternative risk financing transactions also in the united states marsh uses the services of mma securities llc a sec registered brokerdealer investment adviser and member of finra and sipc and jsl securities inc a sec registered brokerdealer and member of finra sipc and the municipal securities rulemaking board primarily in connection with retirement executive compensation and benefits consulting and advisory services to qualified and nonqualified benefits plans companies and executives in the united kingdom marsh and guy carpenter use the expertise of mmc securities europe limited which is authorized and regulated by the fca to provide advice on securities and investments including mergers  acquisitions in the european union mmc securities llc mmc securities europe limited mma securities llc and jsl securities inc are indirect whollyowned subsidiaries of marsh  mclennan companies inc 

consulting  mercers retirementrelated consulting and investment services are subject to pension law and financial regulation in many countries in addition the trustee services investment services including advice to persons institutions and other entities on the investment of pension assets and assumption of discretionary investment management responsibilities and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services provided by mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are also subject to investment and securities regulations in various jurisdictions including regulations imposed or enforced by the sec and the department of labor in the united states the fca in the united kingdom the central bank of ireland and the australian prudential regulation authority and the australian securities and investments commission in the united states mercer provides investment services through mercer investment management inc and mercer investment consulting llc each an secregistered investment adviser in the united states mercer trust company a new hampshire chartered trust bank provides services for mercer’s investment management business in the united states the benefits insurance consulting and brokerage services provided by mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to the same licensing requirements and regulatory oversight as the insurance market intermediaries described above regarding our risk and insurance services businesses mercer uses the services of mmc securities llc to provide certain retirement and employee benefit services oliver wyman group uses the services of mmc securities europe limited in the european union primarily in connection with corporate finance advisory services 

fatca    regulations promulgated by the us treasury department pursuant to the foreign account tax compliance act and related legislation fatca require the company to take various measures relating to nonus funds transactions and accounts the regulations impose on mercer certain client financial account tracking and disclosure obligations with respect to nonus financial institution and insurance 

clients and until recently required marsh and guy carpenter and mercer in limited circumstances to collect validate and maintain certain documentation from each foreign insurance entity that insures a risk that is subject to the regulations on december 13 2018 the us treasury department modified these rules effectively relieving marsh and guy carpenter from fatca compliance with respect to its handling of noncash value premium payments as it relates to these noncash value insurance premiums the new rules were put into immediate effect 

competitive conditions 

the company faces strong competition in all of its businesses from providers of similar products and services including competition with regard to identifying and pursuing acquisition candidates the company also encounters strong competition throughout its businesses from both public corporations and private firms in attracting and retaining qualified employees in addition to the discussion below see risks relating to the company generally — competitive risks in part i item 1a of this report 

risk and insurance services  the companys combined insurance and reinsurance services businesses are global in scope our insurance and reinsurance businesses compete principally on sophistication range quality and cost of the services and products they offer to clients the company encounters strong competition from other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a global regional national or local scale from a large number of regional and local firms in the united states the european union and elsewhere from insurance and reinsurance companies that market distribute and service their insurance and reinsurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses including commercial and investment banks accounting firms consultants and online platforms that provide riskrelated services and products or alternatives to traditional insurance brokerage services in addition third party capital providers have entered the insurance and reinsurance risk transfer market offering products and capital directly to the company’s clients their presence in the market increases the competitive pressures that the company faces 

certain insureds and groups of insureds have established programs of selfinsurance including captive insurance companies as a supplement or alternative traditional thirdparty insurance thereby reducing in some cases their need for insurance placements certain insureds also obtain coverage directly from insurance providers there are also many other providers of managing general agency affinity programs and private client services including specialized firms insurance companies and other institutions 

consulting  the companys consulting businesses face strong competition from other privately and publicly held worldwide and national companies as well as regional and local firms these businesses generally compete on the basis of the range quality and cost of the services and products they provide to clients competitors include independent consulting and outsourcing firms as well as consulting and outsourcing operations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms mercers investments business faces competition from many sources including investment consulting firms many of which offer delegated services and other financial institutions in some cases clients have the option of handling the services provided by mercer and oliver wyman group internally without assistance from outside advisors

we have a history of making acquisitions and investments including a total of 114 in the period from 2013 to 2018 in september 2018 we announced our agreement to acquire the jardine lloyd thompson group plc jlt we expect the acquisition of jlt the jlt transaction to close in the spring of 2019 however we can provide no assurance that the various conditions to closing the jlt transaction will be satisfied 

we may not be able to successfully integrate the business of jlt or any other business that we may acquire into our own business or achieve any expected cost savings or synergies from such integration the potential difficulties that we may face which could cause the results of the acquisition of jlt or any other business to differ from our expectations include but are not limited to the following 



in addition if in the future the performance of our reporting units or an acquired business varies from our projections or assumptions or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units or an acquired business change the estimated fair value of our reporting units or an acquired business could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill and other acquisitionrelated intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet or in adjustments in contingent payment amounts given the significant size of the companys goodwill and intangible assets an impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given period 

we expect that acquisitions will continue to be a key part of our business strategy our success in this regard will depend on our ability to identify and compete for appropriate acquisition candidates and to complete the transactions we decide to pursue with favorable results 

when we dispose of businesses we may continue to be subject to certain liabilities of that business after its disposition relating to the prior period of our ownership and may not be able to negotiate for limitations on those liabilities we are also subject to the risk that the sales price is less than the amount reflected on our balance sheet 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from errors and omissions breach of fiduciary duty and other claims 

our operating companies provide numerous professional services including the placement of insurance and the provision of consulting investment advisory and actuarial services to clients around the world as a result the company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of errors and omissions breach of fiduciary duty and similar claims which we refer to collectively as eo claims in our risk and insurance services segment such claims include allegations of damages arising from our failure to assess clients’ risks advise clients place coverage or notify insurers of potential claims on behalf of clients in accordance with our obligations to them in our consulting segment where we increasingly act in a fiduciary capacity through our investments business such claims could include allegations of damages arising from the provision of consulting investments actuarial pension administration and other services these consulting segment services frequently involve complex calculations and other analysis including i making assumptions about and preparing estimates concerning contingent future events ii drafting and interpreting complex documentation governing pension plans iii calculating benefits within complex pension structures iv providing investment advice including guidance on asset allocation and investment strategy and v managing client assets including the selection of investment managers and implementation of the client’s investment policy we provide these services to a broad client base including clients in the public sector for our investment services matters often relate to services provided by the company dating back many years such claims may subject us to significant liability for monetary damages including punitive and treble damages negative publicity and reputational harm and may divert personnel and management resources we may be unable to effectively limit our potential liability in certain jurisdictions including through insurance or in connection with certain types of claims particularly those concerning claims of a breach of fiduciary duty 

in establishing liabilities for eo claims under generally accepted accounting principles gaap the company uses case level reviews by inside and outside counsel actuarial analysis by oliver wyman group a subsidiary of the company and other methods to estimate potential losses a liability is established when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable the liability is assessed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable given the challenges inherent in establishing liabilities in accordance with gaap as well as the unpredictability of eo claims and the litigation that can flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations or financial condition 

we are subject to regulatory investigations reviews and other inquiries that consume significant management time and if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are subject to regulatory investigations reviews and other inquiries that consume significant management time and if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our 

business results of operations or financial condition for example in october 2017 the company received a notice that the directorategeneral for competition of the european commission had commenced a civil investigation of a number of insurance brokers including marsh regarding the exchange of commercially sensitive information between competitors in relation to aviation and aerospace insurance and reinsurance broking products and services in the european economic area as well as possible coordination between competitors in july 2017 the directorategeneral for competition of the european commission together with the irish competition and consumer protection commission conducted onsite inspections at the offices of marsh and other industry participants in dublin in connection with an investigation regarding the possible participation in anticompetitive agreements andor concerted practices contrary to eu competition law in the market for commercial motor insurance in the republic of ireland in january 2019 we received a notice that the administrative council for economic defense antitrust agency in brazil had commenced an administrative proceeding against a number of insurance brokers including marsh and insurers “to investigate an alleged sharing of sensitive commercial and competitive confidential information” in the aviation insurance and reinsurance sector 

these regulatory matters are ongoing   and we are unable to predict their likely timing outcome or ultimate impact additional information regarding these investigations and certain other legal and regulatory proceedings is set forth in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item 8 of this report in addition by virtue of the acquisition of jlt we will assume the legal liabilities of jlt upon closing accordingly upon closing of the acquisition we will become responsible for jlt’s legal and regulatory exposures some of which may be currently unidentified 

we cannot guarantee that we are or will be in compliance with all current and potentially applicable us federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states and its various states the united kingdom the european union and its member states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate for example we are subject to regulation by agencies such as the securities and exchange commission finra and state insurance regulators in the united states the fca and the competition and markets authority cma in the united kingdom and the european commission in the european union as further described above under part i item 1  business regulation of this report we are also subject to trade sanctions laws relating to countries such as cuba iran russia sudan and syria and anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk antibribery act we are subject to numerous other laws on matters as diverse as internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures securities regulation data privacy and protection cybersecurity taxation antitrust and competition immigration wageandhour standards and employment and labor relations 

the us and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our operations are complex and may change rapidly and our efforts to comply and keep up with them require significant resources in some cases these laws and regulations may decrease the need for our services increase our costs negatively impact our revenues or impose operational limitations on our business including on the products and services we may offer or on the amount or type of compensation we may collect while we attempt to comply with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we our employees our consultants and our contractors and other agents are in full compliance with such laws and regulations or interpretations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws or regulations if we fail to comply or are accused of failing to comply with applicable laws and regulations including those referred to above we may become subject to investigations criminal penalties civil remedies or other consequences including fines injunctions loss of an operating license or approval increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in a particular business or redress to clients or other parties and we may become exposed to negative publicity or reputational damage moreover our failure to comply with laws or regulations in one jurisdiction may result in increased regulatory scrutiny by other regulatory agencies in that jurisdiction or regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions the cost of compliance and the consequences of failing to be in compliance could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in most jurisdictions government regulatory authorities have the power to interpret and amend or repeal applicable laws and regulations and have discretion to grant renew and revoke the various licenses and approvals we need to conduct our activities such authorities may require the company to incur substantial costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations in some areas of our businesses we act on the basis of our own or the industrys interpretations of applicable laws or regulations which may conflict from state to state or country to country in the event those interpretations eventually prove different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities we may be penalized or precluded from carrying on our previous activities moreover the laws and regulations to which we are subject may conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate which increases the likelihood of our businesses being noncompliant in one or more jurisdictions 

cybersecurity and data protection risks 

we could incur significant liability or our reputation could be damaged if our information systems are breached or we otherwise fail to protect client or company data or information systems 

we rely on the efficient uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business and securely process transmit and store electronic information in the normal course of business we also share electronic information with our vendors and other third parties this electronic information comprises sensitive and confidential data including information related to financial records health care mergers and acquisitions and clients’ personal data our information technology systems and safety control systems and those of our numerous thirdparty providers are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of external threats including cyberattacks computer viruses and other malware ransomware and other types of data and systemsrelated modes of attack our systems are also subject to compromise from internal threats such as improper action by employees vendors and other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems moreover we face the ongoing challenge of managing access controls in a complex environment the latency of a compromise is often measured in months but could be years and we may not be able to detect a compromise in a timely manner we could experience significant financial and reputational harm if our information systems are breached sensitive client or company data are compromised surreptitiously modified rendered inaccessible for any period of time or maliciously made public or if we fail to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public or law enforcement agencies following any such event whether due to delayed discovery or a failure to follow existing protocols 

we are at risk of attack by a variety of adversaries including statesponsored organizations organized crime hackers or hactivists activist hackers through use of increasingly sophisticated methods of attack including longterm persistent attacks referred to as advanced persistent threats these techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems include among other things computer viruses malicious or destructive code ransomware social engineering attacks including phishing and impersonation hacking and denialofservice attacks because these techniques change frequently and new techniques may not be identified until they are launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures resulting in potential data loss or other damage to information technology systems 

as the breadth and complexity of the technologies we use and the software and platforms we develop continue to grow including as a result of the use of mobile devices cloud services open source software social media and the increased reliance on devices connected to the internet known as the internet of things the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks also increases despite ongoing efforts to improve our ability to protect data from compromise we may not be able to protect all of our data across our diverse systems our policies employee training including phishing prevention training procedures and technical safeguards may also be insufficient to prevent or detect improper access to confidential personal or proprietary information in addition the competition for talent in the data privacy and cybersecurity space is intense and we may also be unable to hire develop or retain suitable talent capable of adequately detecting mitigating or remediating these risks 

should an attacker gain access to our network using compromised credentials of an authorized user we are at risk that the attacker might successfully leverage that access to compromise additional systems and data certain measures that could increase the security of our systems such as data encryption including data at rest encryption heightened monitoring and logging scanning for source code errors or 

deployment of multifactor authentication take significant time and resources to deploy broadly and such measures may not be deployed in a timely manner or be effective against an attack the inability to implement maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our information systems must be continually updated patched and upgraded to protect against known vulnerabilities the volume of new software vulnerabilities has increased markedly as has the criticality of patches and other remedial measures in addition to remediating newly identified vulnerabilities previously identified vulnerabilities must also be continuously addressed accordingly we are at risk that cyber attackers exploit these known vulnerabilities before they have been addressed due to the large number and age of the systems and platforms that we operate the increased frequency at which vendors are issuing security patches to their products the need to test patches and in some cases coordinate with clients and vendors before they can be deployed we perpetually face the substantial risk that we cannot deploy patches in a timely manner we are also dependent on third party vendors to keep their systems patched and secure in order to protect our data any failure related to these activities could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we have numerous vendors and other third parties who receive personal information from us in connection with the services we offer our clients in addition we have migrated certain data and may increasingly migrate data to the cloud hosted by thirdparty providers some of these vendors and third parties also have direct access to our systems we are at risk of a cyberattack involving a vendor or other third party which could result in a breakdown of such third party’s data protection processes or the cyberattackers gaining access to our infrastructure through the third party to the extent that a vendor or third party suffers a cyberattack that compromises its operations we could incur significant costs and possible service interruption which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have a history of making acquisitions and investments and in september 2018 we announced the agreement to acquire jlt the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk for instance we may not adequately identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities in an acquired entity’s information systems either before or after the acquisition which could affect the value we are able to derive from the acquisition expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to a cyberattack we may also be unable to integrate the systems of the businesses we acquire into our environment in a timely manner which could further increase these risks until such integration takes place 

we have from time to time experienced data incidents and cybersecurity breaches such as malware incursions including computer viruses and ransomware users exceeding their data access authorization employee misconduct and incidents resulting from human error such as loss of portable and other data storage devices or misconfiguration of software or hardware resulting in inadvertent exposure of confidential or proprietary information like many companies we are subject to social engineering attacks such as regular phishing email campaigns directed at our employees that can result in malware infections and data losses although these incidents have resulted in data loss and other damages to date they have not had a material adverse effect on our business or operations in the future these types of incidents could result in confidential personal or proprietary information being lost or stolen surreptitiously modified rendered inaccessible for any period of time or maliciously made public including client employee or company data which could have a material adverse effect on our business in the event of a cyberattack we might have to take our systems offline which could interfere with services to our clients or damage our reputation we also may be unable to detect an incident assess its severity or impact or appropriately respond in a timely manner in addition our liability insurance which includes cyber insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches cyberattacks and other related data and system incidents 

the costs to comply with or our failure to comply with us and foreign laws related to privacy data security and data protection such as the eu general data protection regulation could adversely affect our financial condition operating results and our reputation 

in operating our business and providing services and solutions to clients we store and transfer sensitive employee and client data including personal data in and across multiple jurisdictions we leverage systems and applications that are spread all over the world requiring us to regularly move data across national borders as a result we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states europe and around the world regarding privacy data protection data security and cybersecurity these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing in particular the number of highprofile security breaches at major companies continues to accelerate which will likely lead to even greater regulatory scrutiny 

the scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example the eu general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective in may 2018 greatly increased the european commission’s jurisdictional reach of its laws and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data such as the public disclosure of data breaches privacy impact assessments data portability and the appointment of data protection officers in some cases much remains unknown with respect to how to interpret and implement the gdpr eu member states are tasked under the gdpr to enact certain implementing legislation that would add to or further interpret the gdpr requirements and potentially extend our obligations and potential liability for failing to meet such obligations given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations including classification of data and our commitment to a range of administrative technical and physical controls to protect data and enable data transfers outside of the eu our compliance with the gdpr’s requirements will continue to require time resources and review of the technology and systems we use to satisfy the gdpr’s requirements including as eu member states enact their legislation 

the implementation of the gdpr has led other jurisdictions to amend or propose legislation to amend their existing data protection laws to align with the requirements of the gdpr with the aim of obtaining an adequate level of data protection to facilitate the transfer of personal data to most jurisdictions from the eu accordingly the challenges we face in the eu will likely also apply to other jurisdictions outside the eu that adopt laws similar in construction to the gdpr or regulatory frameworks of equivalent complexity for example brazil   china india and japan have also proposed or adopted sweeping new data protection laws in some cases including data localization laws that will require that personal data stay within their borders at a state level california has enacted a broad consumer privacy law that will come into effect in 2020 and several other states have introduced similar bills or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders in addition to data protection laws countries and states in the us are enacting cybersecurity laws and regulations for example the new york state department of financial services issued in 2017 cybersecurity regulations which impose an array of detailed security measures on covered entities these requirements are being phased in and the last of them comes into effect on march 1 2019 all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time may divert resources from other initiatives and projects and could restrict the way services involving data are offered all of which may adversely affect our results of operations 

furthermore enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase unauthorized disclosure or transfer of sensitive or confidential client or company data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation by the company our vendors or other parties with whom we do business if they fail to meet the standards we impose could subject us to significant litigation monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines and criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions given the complexity of operationalizing the gdpr the maturity level of proposed compliance frameworks and the relative lack of guidance in the interpretation of its numerous requirements we and our clients are at risk of enforcement actions taken by eu data protection authorities or litigation from consumer advocacy groups acting on behalf of data subjects 

competitive risks 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological change 

to remain competitive in many of our business areas we must anticipate and respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological change the threat comes from traditional players such as insurers through disintermediation as well as from new entrants such as technology companies insurtech startup companies and others these players are focused on using technology and innovation including artificial intelligence ai robotics and blockchain to simplify and improve the client experience increase efficiencies alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the industries in which we operate 

in order to maintain a competitive position we must continue to upgrade our legacy operating technology and invest in new technologies and new ways to deliver our products and services we have a number of strategic initiatives involving investments in or partnerships with technology companies as well as investments in technology systems and infrastructure to support our growth strategy these investments may be costly may not be profitable or may be less profitable than what we have experienced historically in some cases we depend on key vendors and partners to provide technology and other support for our strategic initiatives if these vendors or partners fail to perform their obligations or otherwise cease to work with us our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected if we do not keep up with technological changes or execute effectively on our strategic initiatives our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

failure to maintain our corporate culture or damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we strive to create a culture in which our colleagues act with integrity and respect and feel comfortable speaking up to report instances of misconduct or other concerns we are a people business and our ability to attract and retain employees and clients is highly dependent upon our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workplace our level of service trustworthiness ethical business practices and other qualities our colleagues are the cornerstone of this culture and acts of misconduct by any employee and particularly by senior management could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients and other stakeholders negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us in any number of activities or circumstances including operations employment  related offenses such as sexual harassment and discrimination regulatory compliance and the use and protection of data and systems satisfaction of client expectations and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct any damage to our reputation could affect the confidence of our clients rating agencies regulators stockholders and the other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

the loss of members of our senior management team or other key colleagues could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we rely upon the contributions of our senior management team to establish and implement our business strategy and to manage the future growth of our business the loss of any of the senior management team could limit our ability to successfully execute our business strategy or adversely affect our ability to retain existing and attract new clients moreover we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team 

across all of our businesses our colleagues are critical to developing and retaining client relationships as well as performing the services on which our revenues are earned it is therefore important for us to attract incentivize and retain significant revenueproducing employees and the key managerial and other professionals who support them we face numerous challenges in this regard including the intense competition for talent and the general mobility of colleagues 

losing colleagues who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements which could adversely affect our results of operations and subject to applicable enforceable restrictive 

covenants if a key employee were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses including from disintermediation 

as a global professional services firm the company faces intense sustained competition in each of its businesses and the competitive landscape continues to change and evolve our ability to compete successfully depends on a variety of factors including the quality and expertise of our colleagues our geographic reach the sophistication and quality of our services our pricing relative to competitors our clients’ ability to selfinsure or use internal resources instead of consultants and our ability to respond to changes in client demand and industry conditions some of our competitors may have greater financial resources or may be better positioned to respond to technological and other changes in the industries we serve and they may be able to compete more effectively if we are unable to respond successfully to the changing conditions we face our businesses results of operations and financial condition will be adversely impacted 

in our risk and insurance services segment in addition to the challenges posed by capital market alternatives to traditional insurance and reinsurance we compete intensely against a wide range of other insurance and reinsurance brokerage and risk advisory firms that operate on a global regional national or local scale for both client business and employee talent in the last ten years private equity sponsors have invested tens of billions of dollars into the insurance brokerage sector transforming existing players and creating new ones to compete with large global and regional brokers we also compete with inhouse brokers captive insurance companies insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products directly to consumers and without the assistance of brokers or other market intermediaries and with various other companies that provide riskrelated services or alternatives to traditional brokerage services including those that rely almost exclusively on technological solutions or platforms this competition is intensified by an industry trend toward a syndicated or distributed approach to the purchase of insurance and reinsurance brokerage services where a client engages multiple brokers to service different portions of the clients account in addition third party capital providers have entered the insurance and reinsurance risk transfer market offering products and capital directly to our clients that serve as substitutes for traditional insurance 

in our consulting segment we compete for business with numerous consulting firms and similar organizations many of whom also provide or are affiliated with firms that provide accounting information systems technology and financial services such competitors may be able to offer more comprehensive products and services to potential clients which may give them a competitive advantage 

consolidation in the industries we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate or combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work any of these or similar possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business the insurance industry continued to see robust market consolidation in 2018 and this trend could continue or accelerate in 2019 as insurance and reinsurance companies continue to consolidate guy carpenter’s smaller client base may be more susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the marketplace 

we rely on a large number of vendors and other third parties to perform key functions of our business operations and to provide services to our clients these vendors and third parties may act in ways that could harm our business 

we rely on a large number of vendors and other third parties and in some cases subcontractors to provide services data and information such as technology information security funds transfers business process management and administration and support functions that are critical to the operations of our business these third parties include correspondents agents and other brokers and intermediaries insurance markets data providers plan trustees payroll service providers software and system vendors health plan providers investment managers risk modeling providers outsourced providers of client 

related services and providers of human resource functions such as recruiters as we do not fully control the actions of these third parties we are subject to the risk that their decisions or operations may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay and expense a failure by the third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements in a high quality and timely manner particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services could result in economic and reputational harm to us in addition these third parties face their own technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information or failure to comply with applicable law could cause harm to our reputation or otherwise expose us to liability an interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints financial difficulties or for any other reason could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in contractual or regulatory penalties liability claims from clients or employees damage to our reputation and harm to our business 

business resiliency risks 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity or data recovery problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

if we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event such as an earthquake hurricane flood terrorist attack pandemic security breach cyberattack power loss or telecommunications failure our ability to operate will depend in part on the continued availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we could experience operational challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business the risk of business disruption is more pronounced in certain geographic areas including major metropolitan centers like new york or london where we have significant operations and approximately 3500 colleagues in each location and in certain countries and regions in which we operate that are subject to higher potential threat of terrorist attacks or military conflicts 

our operations depend in particular upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage if a business continuity event occurs we could lose client or company data or experience interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients which could have a material adverse effect a cyberattack or other business continuity event affecting us or a key vendor or other third party could result in a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or operations or our ability to recover data requiring us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues for example hackers have increasingly targeted companies by attacking internetconnected industrial control and safety control systems an extended outage could result in the loss of clients and a decline in our revenues 

we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity disaster recovery and data recovery plans and key management succession however a disaster or other continuity event on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover from such an event could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships and legal liability our business disruption insurance may also not fully cover in type or amount the cost of a successful recovery in the event of such a disruption 

financial risks 

the ongoing effects from the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act could make our results difficult to predict 

our effective tax rate may fluctuate in the future as a result of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the tcja which included significant changes in us income tax law that has a meaningful impact on our provision for income taxes and requires significant judgments and estimates in interpretation and calculations we made reasonable estimates of the effects of the deemed repatriation of earnings and other transitional provisions and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 the provisional estimates were trued up during 2018 pursuant to sab 118 however these estimates and the ongoing impact of the tcja are based on our current knowledge and 

assumptions and therefore the ultimate impacts remain uncertain given the significant complexity of the tcja the potential for new legislation or additional guidance from us treasury the securities and exchange commission the financial accounting standards board or other regulatory authorities related to the tcja recognized impacts in future periods could be significantly different from our current estimates such uncertainty may also result in increased scrutiny from or disagreements with tax authorities 

the enacted tax legislation included among other new provisions a reduction in the corporate tax rate new limitations on the deductibility of net interest a tax on global intangible lowtaxed income gilti and the base erosion and antiabuse tax beat with respect to gilti we are experiencing relatively high effective tax rates on our foreign source earnings because of the limitation on foreign tax credits on income already subject to tax rates higher than the us rate the provision continues to be subject to additional regulatory guidance and possible legislative changes which make predicting its impact on our tax rate difficult in addition the interaction of gilti with the interest expense limitations may negatively impact our effective tax rate in addition due to potential revisions to regulations issued by the us treasury or other legal or regulatory changes it cannot be certain that we will not be subject to the beat the beat levies a significant tax on cross border payments to related group companies while we operate in a manner that currently limits our exposure to beat uncertainty about the financial impact on us of this new tax remains and there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to material amounts of beat in the future 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions political events and market conditions 

macroeconomic conditions political events and other market conditions around the world affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve these conditions may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing for those services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations changes in macroeconomic and political conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have a competitive advantage and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain 

the united kingdom’s pending exit from the european union referred to as brexit continues to create political and economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom and the european union the uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of brexit may cause increased economic volatility affecting our operations and business the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to european union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently the measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose clients and colleagues in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which european union laws to replace or replicate these developments may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of financial markets both in the uk and globally any of these factors could affect the demand for our services furthermore currency exchange rates in gbp and the euro with respect to each other and the us dollar have already been adversely affected by these developments should this foreign exchange volatility continue it could cause volatility in our quarterly financial results 

in addition any changes in us trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries resulting in “trade wars” which could affect volume of economic activity in the united states including demand for our services 

our investments including our minority investments in other companies as well as our cash investments and those held in a fiduciary capacity are subject to general credit liquidity counterparty foreign exchange market and interest rate risks these risks may be exacerbated by global macroeconomic conditions market volatility and regulatory financial and other difficulties affecting the companies in which we have invested or that may be faced by financial institution counterparties during times of stress in the banking industry counterparty risk can quickly escalate potentially resulting in substantial trading and investment losses for corporate and other investors in addition we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may continue to experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels if the banking system or the fixed income interest rate credit or equity markets deteriorate the 

value and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected finally the value of the companys assets held in other jurisdictions including cash holdings may decline due to foreign exchange fluctuations 

if we are unable to collect our receivables our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for the work we perform as of december 31 2018 our receivables for our commissions and fees were approximately 40 billion  or approximately onequarter of our total annual revenues and portions of our receivables are increasingly concentrated in certain businesses and geographies 

macroeconomic or political conditions could result in financial difficulties for our clients which could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us 

we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms 

the maintenance and growth of our business the payment of dividends and our ability to make share repurchases rely on our access to capital which depends in large part on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of equity and debt financing certain of our businesses such as gc securities a division of mmc securities llc and mmc securities europe limited also rely on financings by us to fund their underwriting of debt and equity capital raising offerings by their clients there can be no assurance that our operations will generate sufficient positive cash flow to finance all of our capital needs or that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on favorable terms in addition our ability to obtain financing will depend in part upon prevailing conditions in credit and capital markets which are beyond our control 

our defined benefit pension plan obligations could cause the companys financial position earnings and cash flows to fluctuate 

our defined benefit pension obligations and the assets set aside to fund those obligations are sensitive to certain changes in the financial markets any such changes may result in increased pension expense or additional cash payments to fund these plans 

the company has significant defined benefit pension obligations to its current and former employees totaling approximately 145 billion  and related plan assets of approximately 144 billion  at december 31 2018 on a us gaap basis the companys policy for funding its defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth by law in the united states contributions to these plans are based on erisa guidelines outside the united states contributions are generally based on statutory requirements and local funding practices which may differ from measurements under us gaap in the uk for example the assumptions used to determine pension contributions are the result of legallyprescribed negotiations between the company and the plans trustee currently the use of these assumptions results in a lower funded status than determined under us gaap and may result in contributions irrespective of the us gaap funded status 

the financial calculations relating to our defined benefit pension plans are complex pension plan assets could decrease as the result of poor future asset performance also pension plan liabilities periodic pension expense and future funding amounts could increase as a result of a decline in the interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities longer lifespans than those reflected in our mortality assumptions changes in investment markets that result in lower expected returns on assets actual investment return that is less than the expected return on assets adverse changes in laws or regulations and other variables 

while we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of pension volatility on our earnings and cash funding requirements these strategies may not be successful accordingly given the magnitude of our worldwide pension plans variations in or reassessment of the preceding or other factors or potential miscalculations relating to our defined benefit pension plans could cause significant fluctuation from year to year in our earnings and cash flow as well as our pension plan assets liabilities and equity and may result in increased levels of contributions to our pension plans 

our significant nonus operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business 

approximately 52  of our business is located outside of the united states we are subject to exchange rate movement because we must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars and also because some of our subsidiaries receive revenue other than in their functional currencies exchange rate movements may change over time and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows reported in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in certain jurisdictions however while risk and insurance services operations generate revenue in a number of different currencies expenses are almost entirely incurred in local currency due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we are subject to economic exposure as well as currency translation exposure on the net operating results of our operations because the nonus based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 52  of total revenue exchange rate movement can have a significant impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow for additional discussion see market risk and credit riskforeign currency risk in part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this report 

the purchase price of the jlt transaction is denominated in gbp to hedge the risk of appreciation in gbp we entered into a deal contingent foreign exchange contract fx contract which is discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for each 1 increase or decrease in the gbpus dollar exchange rate the fair value of the fx contract will increase dollar weakens or decrease dollar strengthens by approximately 70 million as of december 31 2018 the gbp had depreciated 34 since we entered into the fx contract in september 2018 furthermore and as noted above the unknown impacts of brexit may expose us to additional exchange rate fluctuations in gbp we expect to record fair value gains or losses which may be significant through the consolidated statement of income until the closing of the jlt transaction 

we may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

the company is organized as a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries because we do not have significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations paying dividends to stockholders repurchasing our common stock under our share repurchase program and paying corporate expenses in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and make other payments to the company we may not be able to service our debt pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock or meet our other obligations 

further the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the united states funds from the current year’s earnings of the companys nonus operating subsidiaries are regularly repatriated to the united states a number of factors could arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or could make repatriation costprohibitive including but not limited to the imposition of currency controls and other government restrictions on repatriation in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the imposition of withholding and other taxes on such payments 

in the event we are unable to generate or repatriate cash from our operating subsidiaries our overall liquidity could deteriorate and our ability to finance our obligations including to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock could be adversely affected 

our quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly 

quarterly variations in revenues and operating results may occur due to several factors these include 



 a significant portion of our total operating expenses is relatively fixed in the short term therefore a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results for these businesses 

credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk 

currently the companys senior debt is rated a by sp and baa1 by moodys the ratings from both sp and moodys currently carry a negative outlook 

if we need to raise capital in the future for example in order to fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could limit our access to financing sources further a downgrade to a rating below investmentgrade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures 

we have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility 

we have incurred significant debt in order to finance the jlt transaction as of december 31 2018 we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 58 billion  in january 2019 we issued 5 billion aggregate amount of senior notes to finance in part the jlt transaction we expect to incur additional debt before the closing of the jlt transaction in order to finance the remaining purchase price 

the level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility by reducing our ability to use cash from operations for other purposes including working capital dividends to shareholders share repurchases acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate purposes in addition we are subject to risks that at the time any of our outstanding debt matures we will not be able to retire or refinance the debt on terms that are acceptable to us we also face the risk of a credit rating downgrade if we do not retire or refinance the debt to levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies in a timely manner 

global operations 

we are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations 

we conduct business globally in 2018 approximately 52  of the companys total revenue was generated from operations outside the united states and over onehalf of our employees were located outside the united states we expect to expand our nonus operations further in particular the jlt transaction will significantly expand our nonus operations in jurisdictions such as the uk asia south america and australia upon close 

the geographic breadth of our activities and the activities of jlt upon the consummation of the jlt transaction subjects us to significant legal economic operational market compliance and reputational risks these include among others risks relating to 



risks relating to our risk and insurance services segment 

our risk and insurance services segment conducted through marsh and guy carpenter represented 55  of the companys total revenue in 2018 our business in this segment is subject to particular risks 

results in our risk and insurance services segment may be adversely affected by a general decline in economic activity 

demand for many types of insurance and reinsurance generally rises or falls as economic growth expands or slows this dynamic affects the level of commissions and fees generated by marsh and guy carpenter to the extent our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions they may choose to limit their purchases of insurance and reinsurance coverage as applicable which would inhibit our ability to generate commission revenue and other revenue based on premiums placed by us also the insurance they seek to obtain through us may be impacted by changes in their assets property values sales or number of employees which may reduce our commission revenue and they may decide not to purchase our risk advisory or other services which would inhibit our ability to generate fee revenue moreover insolvencies and combinations associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies and combinations in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by limiting our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business as well as our revenues from insurers guy carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the marketplace 

volatility or declines in premiums and other market trends may significantly impede our ability to grow revenues and profitability 

a significant portion of our risk and insurance services revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to the normal cycles of pricing in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

as traditional insurance companies continue to rely on nonaffiliated brokers or agents to generate premium those insurance companies may seek to reduce their expenses by lowering their commission rates the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility or declines in premiums may significantly affect our revenue and profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes it is difficult to accurately forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result we may have to adjust our plans for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by disintermediation and the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their riskprotection needs this trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to selfinsure the use of captive insurers and the presence of capital marketsbased solutions for traditional insurance and reinsurance needs further the profitability of our risk and insurances services segment depends in part on our ability to be compensated for the analytical services and other advice that we provide including the consulting and analytics services that we provide to insurers if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for all of our services our margins and profitability could decline 

adverse legal developments and future regulations concerning how intermediaries are compensated by insurers or clients as well as allegations of anticompetitive behavior or conflicts of interest more broadly could have a material adverse effect on marsh’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the ways in which insurance intermediaries are compensated receive scrutiny from regulators in part because of the potential for anticompetitive behavior and conflicts of interest the vast majority of the compensation that marsh receives is in the form of retail fees and commissions that are paid by the client or paid from premium that is paid by the client the amount of other compensation that we receive from 

insurance companies separate from retail fees and commissions has increased in the last several years both on an underlying basis and through acquisition this other compensation includes payment for i consulting and analytics services provided to insurers ii administrative and other services provided to insurers including services relating to the administration and management of quota shares lineslips panels and other facilities and iii contingent commissions paid by insurers based on factors such as volume or profitability of marshs placements these other revenue streams present potential regulatory litigation and reputational risks that may arise from alleged anticompetitive behavior or conflicts of interest and future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect such revenue adverse regulatory legal or other developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and expose the company to negative publicity and reputational harm 

risks relating to our consulting segment 

our consulting segment conducted through mercer and oliver wyman group represented 45  of our total revenue in 2018 our businesses in this segment are subject to particular risks 

mercer’s investment management and related services ims business is subject to a number of risks including risks related to thirdparty investment managers operational risk conflicts of interest asset performance and regulatory compliance that if realized could result in significant damage to our business 

mercer’s ims business provides clients with investment consulting and investment management also referred to as delegated solutions or fiduciary management services in the investment consulting business clients make and implement their own investment decisions based upon advice provided by mercer in its delegated solutions business mercer implements the client’s investment policy by engaging and overseeing thirdparty asset managers who determine which investments to buy and sell to effect implementation of a client’s investment policy mercer may utilize its manager of managers investment funds 

mercer’s ims business is subject to a number of risks including risks related to thirdparties our operations conflicts of interest asset performance and regulatory compliance and scrutiny which could arise in connection with these offerings for example mercer’s due diligence on an asset manager may fail to uncover material deficiencies or fraud that could result in investment losses to a client there is a risk that mercer will fail to properly implement a client’s investment policy which could cause an incorrect or untimely allocation of client assets among asset managers or strategies mercer may also be perceived as recommending certain asset managers to clients or offering delegated solutions to an investment consulting client solely to enhance its own compensation asset classes may perform poorly or asset managers may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance a downturn in the global equity markets negligence or other reasons resulting in poor returns or loss of client capital these risks if realized could result in significant liability and damage our business 

revenues for the services provided by our consulting segment may decline for various reasons including as a result of changes in economic conditions the value of equity debt and other asset markets our clients’ or an industrys financial condition or government regulation or an accelerated trend away from actively managed investments to passively managed investments 

global economic conditions may negatively impact businesses and financial institutions many of our clients including financial institutions corporations government entities and pension plans have reduced expenses including amounts spent on consulting services and used internal resources instead of consultants during difficult economic periods the evolving needs and financial circumstances of our clients may reduce demand for our consulting services and could adversely affect our revenues and profitability if the economy or markets in which we operate experience weakness or deteriorate our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition some of mercers ims business generate fees based upon the value of the clients’ assets under management or advisement changes in the value of equity debt currency real estate commodities or other asset classes could cause the value of assets under management or advisement and the fees received by mercer to decline such changes could also cause clients to withdraw funds from mercer’s ims business in favor of other investment service providers in either case our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected mercer’s ims business also could be adversely affected by an accelerated shift away from actively managed 

investments to passively managed investments with associated lower fees further revenue received by mercer as investment manager to the majority of the mercermanaged investment funds is reported in accordance with us gaap on a gross basis rather than a net basis with subadvisor fees reflected as an expense therefore the reported revenue for these offerings does not fully reflect the amount of net revenue ultimately attributable to mercer 

demand for many of mercers benefits services is affected by government regulation and tax laws rulings policies and interpretations which drive our clients needs for benefitsrelated services significant changes in government regulations affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of mercers services 

factors affecting defined benefit pension plans and the services we provide relating to those plans could adversely affect mercer 

mercer currently provides corporate trustees multiemployer and public clients with actuarial consulting and administration services relating to defined benefit pension plans the nature of our work is complex a number of mercers clients have frozen or curtailed their defined benefit plans and have moved to defined contribution plans resulting in reduced revenue for mercers retirement business these developments and a continued or accelerated rate of decline in revenues for our defined benefit pension plans business could adversely affect mercers business and operating results in addition our actuarial services involve numerous assumptions and estimates regarding future events including interest rates used to discount future liabilities estimated rates of return for a plans assets healthcare cost trends salary projections and participants life expectancies our consulting services involve the drafting and interpretation of trust deeds and other complex documentation governing pension plans our administration services include calculating benefits within complicated pension plan structures clients dissatisfied with our services have brought and may bring significant claims against us particularly in the united states and the united kingdom 

the profitability of our consulting segment may decline if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and pricing rates for our consultants 

the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on ensuring that our consultants maintain adequate utilization rates ie the percentage of our consultants working hours devoted to billable activities our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 if the utilization rate for our consulting professionals declines our profit margin and profitability could decline 

in addition the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on the prices we are able to charge for our services the prices we charge are affected by a number of factors including 



 if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for our services our profit margin and profitability could decline

consolidated results of operations 

in 2018 the company’s results of operations and earnings per share were significantly impacted by the following items 



ended december 31 2018 in january 2019 upon issuance of the 5 billion of senior notes the company settled the treasury lock contracts and made a payment to its counter party for 122 million an additional charge of 6 million will be recorded in the first quarter of 2019 related to the settlement of the treasury lock derivatives 

 in 2017 the company’s results of operations and earnings per share were impacted in part by two significant items 

 consolidated operating income increased 4 to 28 billion in 2018 compared with 27 billion in 2017 reflecting the impact of 7 increases in both revenue and operating expenses income before income taxes decreased 15 to 22 billion this decrease primarily resulted from the significant items discussed above the significant items which reduced income before taxes by 21 and more than offset the increase in operating income net income attributable to the company after tax income increased 11 of which 9 was due to the yearoveryear increase in operating earnings and investment income related to the change in fair value of equity securities partly offset by the significant items discussed above and higher interest expense the year over year impact of the significant items was 2 of the increase 

diluted earnings per share increased 13 to 323 in 2018 compared with 287 in 2017 this increase primarily resulted from an increase in operating earnings and investment income related to the change in fair value of equity securities partly offset by the significant items discussed above and higher interest expense as well as a 2 decrease in the average number of shares outstanding the negative earnings per share impact of the significant items was in 2018 largely offset by the yearoveryear impact of the 

460 million charge in 2017 related to us tax reform which together resulted in a net increase of approximately 06 in diluted earnings per share 

average diluted shares outstanding for 2018 decreased to 511 million compared with 519 million during 2017 share repurchases during the year were partly offset by the shares issued related to vesting of share awards and the exercise of employee stock options

expense 

consulting expense in 2018 increased 6 compared with 2017 reflecting increases of 5 on an underlying basis 1 from the impact of acquisitions and 1 from the impact of foreign currency translation the increase in underlying expense reflects higher base salaries asset based fees and recoverable expenses and costs incurred of 51 million associated with a business restructuring at mercer initiated in the fourth quarter of 2018 the company expects to incur additional costs of approximately 2030 million in 2019 related to this initiative 

consulting expense in 2017 increased 5 compared with 2016 reflecting an increase of 3 on an underlying basis and a 3 increase from the impact of acquisitions the increase in underlying expense 

reflects higher base salaries asset based fees and outside service costs partly offset by lower severance costs and lower costs related to liabilities for errors and omissions 

corporate and other 

corporate expense in 2018 was 202 million compared with 186 million in 2017 the increase in expense is primarily due to costs related to the pending acquisition of jlt 

corporate expense in 2017 was 186 million compared with 188 million in 2016 the decrease in expense is primarily due to lower consulting occupancy and general insurance costs 



other corporate items 

interest 

interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to 11 million in 2018 compared with 9 million in 2017 interest expense in 2018 was 290 million compared with 237 million in 2017 the increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher average debt outstanding in 2018 and bridge loan financing fees related to the pending acquisition of jlt 

interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to 9 million in 2017 compared with 5 million in 2016 the decrease is due to the combined effects of a lower level of invested funds and lower interest rates interest expense in 2017 was 237 million compared with 189 million in 2016 due to higher average outstanding debt in 2017 

investment income 

the caption investment income in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments it includes when applicable otherthantemporary declines in the value of securities marktomarket increasesdecreases in equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity method gains or losses on its investments in private equity funds the companys investments may include direct investments in insurance consulting or other strategically linked companies and investments in private equity funds 

as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements effective january 1 2018 the company prospectively adopted a new accounting standard that requires equity investments except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income the company holds certain equity investments that under legacy us gaap were previously treated as available for sale securities whereby the marktomarket change was recorded to other comprehensive income in its consolidated balance sheet the company recorded a cumulativeeffect adjustment increase to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption of 14 million reflecting the reclassification of cumulative unrealized gains net of tax as of december 31 2017 from other comprehensive income to retained earnings therefore prior periods have not been restated 

the company recorded a net investment loss of 12 million in 2018 the net investment loss reflects the impact of an 83 million  charge recorded in 2018 related to an other than temporary decline in the companys equity method investment in alexander forbes see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements partly offset by investment gains of 54 million related to marktomarket changes in equity securities discussed above and 17 million related to investments in private equity funds and other investments the company recorded net investment income of 15 million in 2017 compared to less than 1 million in 2016 the increase in 2017 versus 2016 was primarily due to a gain on the sale of an investment and higher equity method gains related to the companys investments in private equity funds 

income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the us tax legislation commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act the tcja significantly changed the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the tcja generally became effective on january 1 2018 the tcja provided for a reduction in the us corporate tax rate to 21 and the creation of a new method of taxing nonus based operations the tcja also changed the deductibility of certain expenses primarily executive officers’ compensation and interest in the fourth quarter of 2017 the company recorded a provisional charge of 460 million related to the enactment of 

the tcja as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements this provisional charge was adjusted in 2018 

the tcja provided for a transition to a new method of taxing nonus based operations via a transition tax on undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries the company recorded a provisional charge of 240 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as an estimate of us transition taxes and ancillary effects including state taxes and foreign withholding taxes related to the change in permanent reinvestment status with respect to our pre2018 foreign earnings this transition tax is payable over eight years the reduction of the us corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 reduced the value of the us deferred tax assets and liabilities accordingly a charge of 220 million was recorded adjustments during 2018 to the provisional estimates of transition taxes and us deferred tax assets and liabilities decreased income tax expense by 5 million these amounts are now final and the company does not expect further adjustments to the initial provisional charge 

the companys consolidated effective tax rate was 256  429  and 276  in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the rate in 2018 reflects ongoing impacts of the tcja primarily the reduced 21 us statutory tax rate and certain tax planning benefits largely offset by higher estimated costs from the new method of taxing nonus based operations greater disallowance of compensation and entertainment deductions the effect of a charge related to the company’s investment in alexander forbes as discussed in note 10 and a decrease in excess tax benefits related to share compensation primarily due to the lower us tax rate the rates in 2017 and 2016 reflect foreign operations taxed at rates below the 35 us statutory tax rate including the effect of repatriation the tax rates in all periods reflect the impact of discrete tax matters tax legislation and nontaxable adjustments to contingent acquisition consideration 

the effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of the companys earnings which may result in higher or lower tax rates thus a shift in the mix of profits among jurisdictions can affect the effective tax rate in 2018 pretax income in the uk barbados canada australia and ireland accounted for approximately 60 of the companys total nonus pretax income with effective rates in those countries of 26 1 28 27 and 10 respectively 

the tcja is expected to provide an ongoing benefit to our effective tax rate and us cash tax liabilities due to the significantly lower us statutory tax rate and the quasiterritorial system 

as a us domiciled parent holding company marsh  mclennan companies inc is the issuer of essentially all of the companys external indebtedness and incurs the related interest expense in the us further most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the us and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the united states 

the mandatory taxation of accumulated undistributed foreign earnings through the transition tax substantially changed the economic considerations of continued permanent investment of those accumulated earnings a key component of our global capital strategy as a result of the transition tax the company anticipates repatriating most of the accumulated earnings that was previously intended to be permanently reinvested outside of the us we continue to evaluate our global investment and repatriation strategy in light of expected relief from us tax reform under the new quasiterritorial tax regime for future foreign earnings 

the effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future it is sensitive to the geographic mix of and repatriation of the companys earnings which may result in higher or lower effective tax rates losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax assets the effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation 

the realization of deferred tax assets depends on generating future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable tax liabilities are determined and assessed jurisdictionally by legal entity or filing group certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings the company assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets the company considered all available evidence including the existence of a recent history of losses placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that the company believes is more likely than not to be realized 

changes in tax laws rulings policies or related legal and regulatory interpretations occur frequently and may also have significant favorable or adverse impacts on our effective tax rate 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company is organized as a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries as the company does not have significant operations of its own the company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt obligations pay dividends to stockholders repurchase its shares and pay corporate expenses the company can also provide financial support to its operating subsidiaries for acquisitions investments and certain parts of their business that require liquidity such as the capital markets business of guy carpenter other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows 

the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the united states funds from those operating subsidiaries are regularly repatriated to the united states out of annual earnings at december 31 2018 the company had approximately 917 million of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations which includes 168 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements the company expects to continue its practice of repatriating available funds from its nonus operating subsidiaries out of current annual earnings where appropriate a portion of the current year earnings will continue to be permanently reinvested with respect to repatriating 2017 and prior earnings the company has evaluated such factors as its short and longterm capital needs acquisition and borrowing strategies and the availability of cash for repatriation for each of its subsidiaries the company has determined that in general its permanent reinvestment assertions in light of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act should allow the company to repatriate previously taxed earnings from the deemed repatriations as cash becomes available 

during 2018 the company recorded foreign currency translation adjustments which decreased net equity by 529 million continued strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies would further reduce the translated us dollar value of the company’s net investments in its nonus subsidiaries as well as the translated us dollar value of cash repatriations from those subsidiaries 

cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the company 

operating cash flows 

the company generated 24 billion of cash from operations in 2018 compared with 19 billion in 2017 these amounts reflect the net income of the company during those periods excluding gains or losses from investments adjusted for noncash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments of accrued liabilities or receipts of assets and pension contributions 

pensionrelated items 

contributions 

during 2018 the company contributed 30 million to its us pension plans and 82 million to nonus pension plans compared to contributions of 85 million to us plans and 229 million to nonus plans in 2017 

in the united states contributions to the taxqualified defined benefit plans are based on erisa guidelines and the company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80 or more of the liability determined under the erisa guidelines in 2018 the company made 30 million of contributions to its nonqualified plans the company expects to contribute approximately 28 million to its us pension plans in 2019 

the company contributed 21 million to the uk plans in 2018 including an expense allowance of approximately 9 million based on the funding test carried out at november 1 2018 the company contributions to the uk plans in 2019 are expected to be approximately 11 million including the expense allowance 

outside the united states the company has a large number of nonus defined benefit pension plans the largest of which are in the uk which comprise approximately 81 of nonus plan assets at december 31 2018 contribution rates for nonus plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements which may differ significantly from measurements under us gaap in the uk the assumptions used to determine pension contributions are the result of legallyprescribed negotiations between the company and the plans trustee that typically occur every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans currently this results in a lower funded status than under us gaap and may result in contributions irrespective of the us gaap funded status in november 2016 the company and the trustee of the uk defined benefits plans agreed to a funding deficit recovery plan for the uk defined benefit pension plans the current agreement with the trustee sets out the annual deficit contributions which would be due based on the deficit at december 31 2015 the funding level is subject to reassessment in most cases on november 1 of each year if the funding level on november 1 is sufficient no deficit funding contributions will be required in the following year and the contribution amount will be deferred the funding level was reassessed on november 1 2018 and no deficit funding contributions are required in 2019 the funding level will be reassessed on november 1 2019 as part of a longterm strategy which depends on having greater influence over asset allocation and overall investment decisions in november 2016 the company renewed its agreement to support annual deficit contributions by the uk operating companies under certain circumstances up to gbp 450 million over a sevenyear period 

in the aggregate the company expects to contribute approximately 65 million  to its nonus defined benefit plans in 2019 comprising approximately 54 million to plans outside of the uk and 11 million to the uk plans 

changes to pension plans 

in march 2017 the company modified its defined benefit pension plans in canada to discontinue further benefit accruals for participants after december 31 2017 and replaced them with a defined contribution arrangement the company also amended its postretirement benefits plan in canada so that individuals who retire after april 1 2019 will not be eligible to participate except in certain situations the company remeasured the assets and liabilities of the plans based on assumptions and market conditions on the amendment date 

in october 2016 the company modified its us defined benefit pension plans to discontinue further benefit accruals for participants after december 31 2016 at the same time the company amended its us defined contribution retirement plans for most of its us employees to add an automatic company contribution equal to 4 of eligible base pay beginning on january 1 2017 this new company contribution together with the company’s current matching contribution provides eligible us employees with the opportunity to receive a total contribution of up to 7 of eligible base pay as required under gaap the defined benefit plans that were significantly impacted by the modification were remeasured in october 2016 using market data and assumptions as of the modification date the net periodic pension expense recognized in 2016 reflects the weighted average costs of the december 31 2015 measurement and the october 2016 remeasurement in addition the us qualified plans were merged effective december 30 2016 since no participants would be receiving benefit accruals after december 2016 

changes in funded status and expense 

the yearoveryear change in the funded status of the companys pension plans is impacted by the difference between actual and assumed results particularly with regard to return on assets and changes in the discount rate as well as the amount of company contributions if any unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately 19 billion and 26 billion at december 31 2018 for the us plans and nonus plans respectively compared with 18 billion and 26 billion at december 31 2017 the increase in the us was primarily due to a decrease in asset values partly offset by the impact of an increase in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities the actuarial loss related to the nonus plans was unchanged as a decrease in the value of the plans assets was offset by the impact of increases in the discount rate used to measure the plans liabilities the impact of the uk settlement in the fourth quarter of 2018 discussed above and by the impact of foreign exchange translation in the past several years the amount of unamortized losses has been significantly impacted both positively and negatively by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities 

increased in both the us and the uk the companys largest plans in 2018 the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities decreased in 2017 and in 2016 the decreases in 2017 and 2016 followed an increase in 2015 an increase in the discount rate decreases the measured plan benefit obligation resulting in actuarial gains while a decrease in the discount rate increases the measured plan obligation resulting in actuarial losses during 2018 the companys defined benefit pension plan assets had losses of 74 and 10 in the us and uk respectively during 2017 the companys defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 193 and 91 in the us and uk respectively during 2016 the companys defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 98 in the us and 221 in the uk 

overall based on the measurement at december 31 2018 expenses related to the company’s defined benefit plans are expected to decrease in 2019 by approximately 51 million compared to 2018 reflecting an increase in us plans of 8 million and a decrease in nonus plans of approximately 59 million primarily in the uk the decrease in nonus plans is primarily in the uk and reflects a lower charge for amortization of the net actuarial loss as well as the reduction in the 2018 net benefit credit by the 42 million settlement charge discussed previously the recognition of a similar charge in 2019 and the amount of such a charge if any is dependent upon whether participant lump sum elections reach or exceed the settlement threshold 

prior to 2016 service and interest costs were estimated using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curves used to measure the benefit obligations at the beginning of the period in 2016 the company changed the approach used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its significant nonus plans this change in approach was made to improve the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs the change did not impact the measurement of the plans’ total projected benefit obligation the company accounted for this change as a change in estimate that was applied prospectively beginning in 2016 and resulted in pension expense being approximately 45 million lower in 2016 than if the prior approach had been used

management’s discussion of critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from those estimates 

revenue recognition 

the adoption of the new revenue standard on january 1 2018 has increased the significance of judgments and estimates management must make to apply the guidance in particular in the risk and insurance services segment judgments related to the amount of variable revenue consideration to ultimately be received on placement of quota share reinsurance treaties and contingent commission from insurers which was previously recognized when the contingency was resolved now requires significant judgments and estimates 

under the new standard certain costs to obtain or fulfill a contract that were previously expensed as incurred have been capitalized the company capitalizes the incremental costs to obtain contracts primarily related to commissions or sales bonus payments these deferred costs are amortized over the expected life of the underlying customer relationships the company also capitalizes certain preplacement costs that are considered fulfillment costs that are amortized at a point in time when the associated revenue is recognized 

management also makes significant judgments and estimates to measure the progress toward completing performance obligations and realization rates for consideration related to contracts as well as potential performancebased fees in the consulting segment 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

legal and other loss contingencies 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions eo gaap requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance the company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel an internal actuarial analysis by oliver wyman group a subsidiary of the company and other methods to estimate potential losses the liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable given the unpredictability of eo claims and of litigation that could flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the company’s businesses results of operations financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period

the company recognizes the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci net of tax in the company’s consolidated balance sheets the gains and losses that exceed specified corridors are amortized prospectively out of aoci over a period that approximates the remaining life expectancy of participants in plans where substantially all participants are inactive or the average remaining service period of active participants for plans with active participants the vast majority of unrecognized losses relate to inactive plans and are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the participants 

the determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate mortality and assumed rate of salary increase the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements the assumptions for expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate are discussed in more detail below 

the longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption is determined for each plan based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of the measurement date and the specific portfolio mix of each plan’s assets the company utilizes a model developed by mercer a subsidiary of the company to assist in the determination of this assumption the model takes into account several factors including actual and target portfolio allocation investment administrative and trading expenses incurred directly by the plan trust historical portfolio performance relevant forwardlooking economic analysis and expected returns variances and correlations for different asset classes these measures are used to determine probabilities using standard statistical techniques to calculate a range of expected returns on the portfolio 

the target asset allocation for the us plans is 64  equities and equity alternatives and 36  fixed income at december 31 2018 the actual allocation for the us plans was 62  equities and equity alternatives and 38  fixed income at the end of 2018 the target asset allocation for the uk plans which comprise approximately 81  of nonus plan assets was 34 equities and equity alternatives and 66 fixed income at december 31 2018 the actual allocation for the uk plans was 34  equities and equity alternatives and 66  fixed income 

the discount rate selected for each us plan is based on a model bond portfolio with coupons and redemptions that closely match the expected liability cash flows from the plan discount rates for nonus plans are based on appropriate bond indices adjusted for duration in the uk the plan duration is reflected using the mercer yield curve 

the table below shows the weighted average assumed rate of return and the discount rate at the december 31 2018 measurement date for measuring pension expense in 2019 for the total company the us and the rest of world row 



holding all other assumptions constant a halfpercentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the us and uk plans which together comprise approximately 84 of total pension plan liabilities as follows 



the impact of discount rate changes shown above relates to the increase or decrease in actuarial gains   or losses being amortized through net periodic pension cost as well as the increase or decrease in interest expense with all other facts and assumptions held constant it does not contemplate nor include potential future impacts a change in the interest rate environment and discount rates might cause such as the impact on the market value of the plans’ assets changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant also may not be representative of the impact on expense because the longterm rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost 

the company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees the cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the us is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire but is funded by the company as incurred the key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the companys tax rate reflects its income statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates in 2017 the companys tax expense was significantly impacted by the enactment of the tcja which is discussed in more detail in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions the company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the evaluation of a tax position is a twostep process the first step involves recognition the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on only the technical merits of the position the technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes legislative intent regulations rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position if a tax position does not meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue 

certain items are included in the companys tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities which are measured at existing tax rates deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements the company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company also considers tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carryback of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law the underlying assumptions the company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the companys recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carryforwards are deductible or creditable valuation allowances are established for deferred tax 

assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction 

fair value determinations 

goodwill impairment testing – the company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred the company performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year in accordance with applicable accounting guidance the company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the company considered numerous factors which included that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin in its most recent estimate of reporting unit fair values whether significant acquisitions or dispositions occurred which might alter the fair value of its reporting units macroeconomic conditions and their potential impact on reporting unit fair values actual performance compared with budget and prior projections used in its estimation of reporting unit fair values industry and market conditions and the yearoveryear change in the company’s share price 

the company completed its qualitative assessment in the third quarter of 2018 and concluded that a twostep goodwill impairment test was not required in 2018 and that goodwill was not impaired 

sharebased payment 

the guidance for accounting for sharebased payments requires among other things that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values in addition management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards as defined by the accounting guidance 

as of december 31 2018 there was  17 million  of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards the weightedaverage period over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 124  years also as of december 31 2018 there was  2389 million  of unrecognized compensation cost related to the company’s restricted stock restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards the weightedaverage period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is approximately 102  years 

see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding accounting for sharebased payments 

investments and derivatives 

although not directly recorded in the company’s consolidated balance sheets the companys defined benefit pension plans hold investments of approximately 144 billion which include private equity and other nonliquid investments the fair value of the plan investments determines in part the overor underfunded status of those plans which is included in the company’s consolidated balance sheets the company also has minority positions in certain equity securities primarily alexander forbes as well as approximately 80 million of investments in private equity funds accounted for using the equity method of accounting 

the company reviews the carrying value of its investments both direct and held through its pension plans to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements the company bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they relate to each investment in those instances where quoted market prices are not available particularly for private equity funds significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate value of the company’s investments fair value of investments in private equity funds is determined by the funds’ investment managers factors considered in determining the fair value of private equity investments include implied valuation of recently completed financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors performance multiples of comparable public companies restrictions on the sale or disposal of the investments trading characteristics of the securities and the relative size of the holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public market float 

in connection with the jlt transaction the company entered into several derivative contracts described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements these derivative contracts are recorded at fair value

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk and credit risk 

certain of the company’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets 

interest rate risk and credit risk 

interest income generated from the company’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates 

the company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates   



based on the above balances if shortterm interest rates increased or decreased by 10 or 15 basis points over the full year annual interest income including interest earned on fiduciary funds would increase or decrease by approximately 6 million 

in addition to interest rate risk our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counterparty credit risk to minimize this risk the company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a board approved investment policy the policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counterparty limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment the company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions the majority of cash and fiduciary fund investments are invested in shortterm bank deposits and liquid money market funds 

foreign currency risk 

the translated values of revenue and expense from the company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates the nonus based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 52  of total revenue we periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business although the company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location as such under normal circumstances the us dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the us dollar generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk however there have been periods where the impact was not mitigated due to external market factors and external macroeconomic events such as uncertainty regarding the impact of brexit in the united kingdom may result in greater foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future if foreign exchange rates of major currencies euro sterling australian dollar and canadian dollar moved 10 in the same direction against the us dollar compared with the foreign exchange rates in 2018  the company estimates net operating income would increase or decrease by approximately 56 million the company has exposure to approximately 80 foreign currencies overall in continental europe the largest amount of revenue from renewals for the risk  insurance services segment occurs in the first quarter 

jlt transaction 

the purchase price of the jlt transaction is denominated in gbp to hedge the risk of appreciation in gbp the company entered into an fx contract in september 2018 which is discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for each 1 increase or decrease in the gbpus dollar exchange rate the fair value of the fx contract will increase dollar weakens or decrease dollar strengthens by approximately 70 million 

equity price risk 

as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements effective january 1 2018 the company adopted a new accounting standard that requires equity investments with readily determinable market values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income 

the company holds investments in both public and private companies as well as private equity funds including investments of approximately 146 million  that are valued using readily determinable fair values and approximately 75 million  of investments without readily determinable fair values the company also has investments of approximately 287 million  that are accounted for using the equity method including the companys investment in alexander forbes the investments are subject to risk of decline in market value which if determined to be other than temporary for assets without readily determinable fair values could result in realized impairment losses the company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements 

the company owns approximately 33  of the common stock of alexander forbes a south african company listed on the johannesburg stock exchange which it purchased in 2014 for 750  south african rand per share the shares of af have been trading below the company’s carrying value since november of 2017 but had traded within 10  of the company’s carrying value through much of the first quarter of 2018 in may 2018 the trading price declined to 30  to 35  below the company’s cost and remained at the discounted level through the third quarter of 2018 the company considered several factors in assessing the carrying value of its investment in af including its financial position the near and longterm prospects of af and the broader south african economy and capital markets the length of time and extent to which the market value was below cost and the company’s intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for anticipated recovery in market value however based on the duration of time and the extent to which the shares traded below their cost the company could not develop sufficient objective evidence to support a recovery of the price in the relatively near future as such the company concluded the decline in value of the investment was other than temporary and recorded a charge of  83 million  in 2018 as of december 31 2018  the carrying value of the company’s investment in alexander forbes was approximately 144 million  as of december 31 2018  the market value of the approximately 443 million  shares of alexander forbes owned by the company based on the december 31 2018  closing share price of 514  south african rand per share was approximately 159 million

regulation 

the companys activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under us federal and state laws as well as laws of other countries in which the companys subsidiaries operate see part i item 1a risk factors below for a discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our businesses 

risk and insurance services  while laws and regulations vary from location to location every state of the united states and most foreign jurisdictions require insurance market intermediaries and related service providers such as insurance brokers agents and consultants reinsurance brokers and managing general agents to hold an individual or company license from a government agency or selfregulatory organization some jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locallyowned business entities in those instances if the company has no licensed subsidiary it may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction such arrangements are subject to an internal review and approval process licensing of reinsurance intermediaries is generally less rigorous compared to that of insurance brokers and most jurisdictions require only corporate reinsurance intermediary licenses 

the insurance mediation directive was adopted by the united kingdom and 26 other european union member states in 2005 its implementation gave powers to the financial services authority fsa the 

united kingdom regulator at the time to expand their responsibilities in line with the financial services and markets act the result of which was the regulation of insurance and reinsurance intermediaries the enhanced regulatory regime implemented in the united kingdom created a licensing system based on an assessment of factors which included professional competence financial capacity and the requirement to hold professional indemnity insurance in april 2013 the fsa was superseded by the financial conduct authority fca in april 2014 the fca’s responsibilities were expanded further to include the regulation of credit activities for consumers this included the broking of premium finance to consumers who wished to spread the cost of their insurance in april 2015 the fca obtained concurrent competition powers enabling it to enforce prohibitions on anticompetitive behavior in relation to financial services 

insurance authorities in the united states and certain other jurisdictions in which the companys subsidiaries do business including the fca in the united kingdom also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others these laws and regulations typically provide for segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them and generally apply to both the insurance and reinsurance business 

certain of the companys risk and insurance services activities are governed by other regulatory bodies such as investment securities and futures licensing authorities in the united states marsh and guy carpenter use the services of mmc securities llc a sec registered brokerdealer in the united states investment adviser and introducing broker mmc securities llc is a member of the financial industry regulatory authority finra the national futures association and the securities investor protection corporation sipc primarily in connection with capital markets and other investment bankingrelated services relating to insurancelinked and alternative risk financing transactions also in the united states marsh uses the services of mma securities llc a sec registered brokerdealer and member of finra sipc and the municipal securities rulemaking board primarily in connection with retirement executive compensation and benefits consulting and advisory services to qualified and nonqualified benefits plans companies and executives in the united kingdom marsh and guy carpenter use the expertise of mmc securities europe limited which is authorized and regulated by the fca to provide advice on securities and investments including mergers  acquisitions in the european union mmc securities llc mmc securities europe limited and mma securities llc are indirect whollyowned subsidiaries of marsh  mclennan companies inc

fatca    regulations promulgated by the us treasury department pursuant to the foreign account tax compliance act and related legislation fatca require the company to take various measures relating to nonus funds transactions and accounts the regulations impose on mercer certain client financial account tracking and disclosure obligations with respect to nonus financial institution and insurance clients and require marsh and guy carpenter and mercer in limited circumstances to collect validate and maintain certain documentation from each foreign insurance entity that insures a risk that is subject 

to the regulations as of january 1 2017 fatca expanded to regulate a broader set of insurance and reinsurance placements known as foreigntoforeign transactions the company has adopted processes to substantially address fatca’s requirements 

competitive conditions

risk and insurance services  the companys combined insurance and reinsurance services businesses are global in scope our insurance and reinsurance businesses compete principally on sophistication range quality and cost of the services and products they offer to clients the company encounters strong competition from other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a global regional national or local scale from a large number of regional and local firms in the united states the european union and elsewhere from insurance and reinsurance companies that market distribute and service their insurance and reinsurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses including commercial and investment banks accounting firms consultants and online platforms that provide riskrelated services and products or alternatives to traditional insurance brokerage services in addition third party capital providers have entered the insurance and reinsurance risk transfer market offering products and capital directly to the company’s clients their presence in the market increases the competitive pressures that the company faces 

certain insureds and groups of insureds have established programs of self insurance including captive insurance companies as a supplement or alternative to thirdparty insurance thereby reducing in some cases their need for insurance placements certain insureds also obtain coverage directly from insurance providers there are also many other providers of managing general agency affinity programs and private client services including specialized firms insurance companies and other institutions 

consulting  the companys consulting businesses face strong competition from other privately and publicly held worldwide and national companies as well as regional and local firms these businesses generally compete on the basis of the range quality and cost of the services and products they provide to clients competitors include independent consulting and outsourcing firms as well as consulting and outsourcing operations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms mercers investments business faces competition from many sources including investment consulting firms many of which offer delegated services and other financial institutions in some cases clients have the option of handling the services provided by mercer and oliver wyman group internally without assistance from outside advisors

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information presented in this report these risks have the potential to materially adversely affect the companys business results of operations or financial condition 

risks relating to the company generally 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from errors and omissions breach of fiduciary duty and other claims 

our operating companies provide numerous professional services including the placement of insurance and the provision of consulting investment advisory and actuarial services to clients around the world as a result the company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of errors and omissions breach of fiduciary duty and similar claims which we refer to collectively as eo claims in our risk and insurance services segment such claims include allegations of damages arising from our failure to assess clients’ risks advise clients place coverage or notify insurers of potential claims on behalf of clients in accordance with our obligations to them in our consulting segment where we increasingly act in a fiduciary capacity through our investments business such claims include allegations of damages arising from the provision of consulting investments actuarial pension administration and other services these services frequently involve complex calculations and other analysis including i making assumptions about and preparing estimates concerning   contingent future events ii drafting and interpreting complex documentation governing pension plans iii calculating benefits within complex pension structures  iv providing investment advice including guidance on asset allocation and investment strategy and v managing client assets including the selection of investment managers these matters often relate to services provided by the company dating back many years such claims may subject us to significant liability for monetary damages including punitive and treble damages negative publicity and reputational harm   and may divert personnel and management resources we may be unable to effectively limit our potential liability in certain jurisdictions including through insurance or in connection with certain types of claims particularly those concerning claims of a breach of fiduciary duty 

in establishing liabilities for eo claims under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” the company uses case level reviews by inside and outside counsel actuarial analysis by oliver wyman group a subsidiary of the company and other methods to estimate potential losses a liability is established when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable the liability is assessed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable given the challenges inherent in establishing liabilities in accordance with gaap as well as the unpredictability of eo claims and the litigation that can flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations or financial condition in a given quarterly or annual period 

we are subject to regulatory investigations reviews and other inquiries that consume significant management time and if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are subject to regulatory investigations reviews and other inquiries that consume significant management time and if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition for example in 2017 we received notices related to four separate regulatory matters in europe in october 2017 the company received a notice that the directorategeneral for competition of the european commission had commenced a civil investigation of a number of insurance brokers including marsh regarding the exchange of commercially sensitive information between competitors in relation to aviation and aerospace insurance and reinsurance broking products and services in the european economic area as well as possible coordination between competitors in june 2017 the fca issued a final report in connection with a market study of the uk asset management industry which includes asset managers and investment consultants including 

mercer following the report in september 2017 the fca announced its decision to refer the investment consulting and fiduciary management markets to the uk competition  markets authority the cma for a market investigation in july 2017 the directorategeneral for competition of the european commission together with the irish competition and consumer protection commission conducted onsite inspections at the offices of marsh and other industry participants in dublin in connection with an investigation regarding the possible participation in anticompetitive agreements andor concerted practices contrary to eu competition law in the market for commercial motor insurance in the republic of ireland in november 2017 the fca announced the terms of reference for a market study concerning the wholesale insurance broker sector in the united kingdom to assess how effective competition is working in the wholesale insurance broker sector” and “how brokers influence competition in the underwriting sector 

these regulatory matters are at early stages and we are unable to predict their likely timing outcome or ultimate impact additional information regarding these investigations and certain other legal and regulatory proceedings is set forth in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item 8 of this report 

we cannot guarantee that we are or will be in compliance with all current and potentially applicable us federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states and its various states the united kingdom the european union and its member states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate for example we are subject to regulation by agencies such as the securities and exchange commission finra and state insurance regulators in the united states the fca and the competition and markets authority cma in the united kingdom and the european commission in the european union as further described above under part i item 1  business regulation of this report we are also subject to trade sanctions laws relating to countries such as cuba iran russia sudan and syria and anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk antibribery act we are subject to numerous other laws on matters as diverse as internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures securities regulation data privacy and protection taxation antitrust and competition immigration wageandhour standards and employment and labor relations 

the us and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our operations are complex and may change rapidly and our efforts to comply and keep up with them require significant resources in some cases these laws and regulations may decrease the need for our services increase our costs negatively impact our revenues or impose operational limitations on our business including on the products and services we may offer or on the amount or type of compensation we may collect while we attempt to comply with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we our employees our consultants and our contractors and other agents are in full compliance with such laws and regulations or interpretations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws or regulations if we fail to comply or are accused of failing to comply with applicable laws and regulations including those referred to above we may become subject to investigations criminal penalties civil remedies or other consequences including fines injunctions loss of an operating license or approval increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in a particular business or redress to clients or other parties and may become exposed to negative publicity or reputational damage moreover our failure to comply with laws or regulations in one jurisdiction may result in increased regulatory scrutiny by other regulatory agencies in that jurisdiction or regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions the cost of compliance and the consequences of failing to be in compliance could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in most jurisdictions government regulatory authorities have the power to interpret and amend or repeal applicable laws and regulations and have discretion to grant renew and revoke the various licenses and approvals we need to conduct our activities such authorities may require the company to incur substantial costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations in some areas of our businesses we act on the basis of our own or the industrys interpretations of applicable laws or regulations which may conflict from state to state or country to country in the event those interpretations eventually prove 

different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities we may be penalized or precluded from carrying on our previous activities moreover the laws and regulations to which we are subject may conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate which increases the likelihood of our businesses being noncompliant in one or more jurisdictions 

cybersecurity and data protection risks 

we could incur significant liability or our reputation could be damaged if our information systems are breached or we otherwise fail to protect client or company data or information systems 

we rely on the efficient uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business and securely process transmit and store electronic information in the normal course of business we also share electronic information with our vendors and other third parties this electronic information comprises sensitive and confidential data including information related to financial records health care mergers and acquisitions and clients’ personal data our information technology systems and safety control systems and those of our numerous thirdparty providers are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of external threats including cyberattacks computer viruses and other malware ransomware and other types of data and systems related incidents our systems are also subject to compromise from internal threats such as improper action by employees vendors and other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems moreover we face the ongoing challenge of managing access controls in a complex environment the latency of a compromise is often measured in months but could be years and we may not be able to detect a compromise in a timely manner we could experience significant financial and reputational harm if our information systems are breached sensitive client or company data are compromised surreptitiously modified rendered inaccessible for any period of time or maliciously made public or if we fail to make adequate disclosures to the public or law enforcement agencies following any such event 

we are at risk of attack by a growing list of adversaries including statesponsored organizations organized crime hackers or hactivists activist hackers through use of increasingly sophisticated methods of attack including longterm persistent attacks referred to as advanced persistent threats because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures resulting in potential data loss or other damage to information technology systems 

as the breadth and complexity of the technologies we use continue to grow including as a result of the use of mobile devices cloud services social media and the increased reliance on devices connected to the internet known as the internet of things the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks also increases despite ongoing efforts to improve our ability to protect data from compromise we may not be able to protect all of our data across our diverse systems should an attacker gain access to our network using compromised credentials of an authorized user we are at risk that the attacker might successfully leverage that access to compromise additional systems and data certain measures that could increase the security of our systems such as data encryption or deployment of multifactor authentication take significant time and resources to deploy broadly and such measures may not be effective against an attack the inability to implement maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our information systems must be continually updated patched and upgraded to protect against known vulnerabilities the volume of new software vulnerabilities has increased markedly as has the criticality of patches and other remedial measures in addition to remediating newly identified vulnerabilities previously identified vulnerabilities must also be continuously addressed accordingly we are at risk that cyber attackers exploit these known vulnerabilities before they have been addressed due to the large number and age of the systems and platforms that we operate the increased frequency at which vendors are issuing security patches to their products the need to test patches and in some cases coordinate with clients and vendors before they can be deployed we perpetually face the substantial risk that we cannot deploy patches in a timely manner we are also dependent on third party vendors to keep their systems patched and secure in order to protect our data any failure related to these activities could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we have numerous vendors and other third parties who receive personal information from us in connection with the services we offer our clients in addition we have migrated certain data and may increasingly migrate data to the cloud hosted by thirdparty providers some of these vendors and third parties also have direct access to our systems we are at risk of a cyberattack involving a vendor or other third party which could result in a breakdown of such third party’s data protection processes or the cyberattackers gaining access to our infrastructure through the third party to the extent that a vendor or third party suffers a cyberattack that compromises its operations we could incur significant costs and possible service interruption which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have a history of making acquisitions and investments including 111 in the period from 20122017 the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk for instance we may not adequately identify weaknesses in an acquired entity’s information systems either before or after the acquisition which could affect the value we are able to derive from the acquisition expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to a cyberattack we may also be unable to integrate the systems of the businesses we acquire into our environment in a timely manner which could further increase these risks until such integration takes place 

our policies employee training including phishing prevention training procedures and technical safeguards may be insufficient to prevent or detect improper access to confidential personal or proprietary information by employees vendors or other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems improper access to or disclosure of sensitive client or company information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts as well as under existing or future laws rules and regulations 

we have from time to time experienced data incidents and cybersecurity breaches such as malware incursions including computer viruses and ransomware users exceeding their data access authorization employee misconduct and incidents resulting from human error such as loss of portable and other data storage devices like many companies we are subject to regular phishing email campaigns directed at our employees that can result in malware infections and data losses although these incidents have resulted in data loss and other damages to date they have not had a material adverse effect on our business or operations in the future these types of incidents could result in confidential personal or proprietary information being lost or stolen surreptitiously modified rendered inaccessible for any period of time or maliciously made public including client employee or company data which could have a material adverse effect on our business in the event of a cyberattack we might have to take our systems offline which could interfere with services to our clients or damage our reputation we also may be unable to detect an incident assess its severity or impact or appropriately respond in a timely manner in addition our liability insurance which includes cyber insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches cyber  attacks and other related data and system incidents  

the costs to comply with or our failure to comply with us and foreign laws related to privacy data security and data protection such as the eu general data protection regulation could adversely affect our financial condition operating results and our reputation 

in operating our business and providing services and solutions to clients we store and transfer sensitive employee and client data including personal data in and across multiple jurisdictions we leverage systems and applications that are spread all over the world requiring us to regularly move data across national borders as a result we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states europe and around the world regarding privacy data protection and data security these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing in particular the number of highprofile security breaches at major companies continues to accelerate which will likely lead to even greater regulatory scrutiny 

the scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example the eu general data protection regulation gdpr which becomes effective in may 2018 greatly increases the european commission’s jurisdictional reach of its laws and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data such as the public disclosure of data breaches privacy impact assessments data 

portability and the appointment of data protection officers in some cases other countries around the world including china japan australia and singapore have recently adopted sweeping new data protection laws or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders at a state level the new york state department of financial services by way of example has issued cybersecurity regulations which impose an array of detailed security measures on covered entities all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time may divert resources from other initiatives and projects and could restrict the way services involving data are offered all of which may adversely affect our results of operations 

furthermore enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase unauthorized disclosure or transfer of sensitive or confidential client or company data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation by the company our vendors or other parties with whom we do business could subject us to significant litigation monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines and criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions for example under the gdpr violations could result in a fine of up to 4 of a corporation’s global annual revenue 

competitive risks 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological change  

to remain competitive in many of our business areas we must anticipate and respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological change the threat comes from traditional players such as insurers through disintermediation as well as from new entrants such as technology companies insurtech startup companies and others these players are focused on using technology and innovation including artificial intelligence ai and blockchain to simplify and improve the customer experience increase efficiencies alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the industries in which we operate 

in order to maintain a competitive position we must continue to invest in new technologies and new ways to deliver our products and services we have a number of strategic initiatives involving investments in technology systems and infrastructure to support our growth strategy these investments may not be profitable or may be less profitable than what we have experienced historically in some cases we depend on key vendors and partners to provide technology and other support for our strategic initiatives if these vendors or partners fail to perform their obligations or otherwise cease to work with us our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected if we do not keep up with technological changes or execute well on our strategic initiatives our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

failure to maintain our corporate culture or damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we strive to create a culture in which our colleagues act with integrity and respect and feel comfortable speaking up to report instances of misconduct we are a people business and our ability to attract and retain employees and clients is highly dependent upon our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workplace our level of service trustworthiness ethical business practices and other qualities our colleagues are the cornerstone of this culture and acts of misconduct by any employee and particularly by senior management could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients and other stakeholders negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us in any number of activities or circumstances including operations employment related offenses such as sexual harassment and discrimination regulatory compliance and the use and protection of data and systems satisfaction of client expectations and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct this damage to our reputation could affect the confidence of our clients rating agencies regulators stockholders and the other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

the loss of members of our senior management team or other key colleagues could have a material adverse effect on our business  

we rely upon the contributions of our senior management team to establish and implement our business strategy and to manage the future growth of our business the loss of any of the senior management team could limit our ability to successfully execute our business strategy or adversely affect our ability to retain existing and attract new clients moreover we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team  

across all of our businesses our colleagues are critical to developing and retaining the client relationships as well as performing the services on which our revenues are earned it is therefore important for us to attract incentivize and retain significant revenueproducing employees and the key managerial and other professionals who support them we face numerous challenges in this regard including the intense competition for talent and the general mobility of colleagues 

losing colleagues who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements which could adversely affect our results of operations and subject to applicable enforceable restrictive covenants if a key employee were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses including from disintermediation 

as a global professional services firm the company faces intense sustained competition in each of its businesses and the competitive landscape continues to change and evolve our ability to compete successfully depends on a variety of factors including the quality and expertise of our colleagues our geographic reach the sophistication and quality of our services our pricing relative to competitors our customers ability to selfinsure or use internal resources instead of consultants and our ability to respond to changes in client demand and industry conditions some of our competitors may have greater financial resources or may be better positioned to respond to technological and other changes in the industries we serve and they may be able to compete more effectively if we are unable to respond successfully to the changing conditions we face our businesses results of operations and financial condition will be adversely impacted 

in our risk and insurance services segment in addition to the challenges posed by capital market alternatives to traditional insurance and reinsurance we compete intensely against a wide range of other insurance and reinsurance brokerage and risk advisory firms that operate on a global regional national or local scale for both client business and employee talent we also compete with insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products directly to consumers and without the assistance of brokers or other market intermediaries and with various other companies that provide riskrelated services or alternatives to traditional brokerage services   including those that rely almost exclusively on technological solutions or platforms this competition is intensified by an industry trend toward a syndicated or distributed approach to the purchase of insurance and reinsurance brokerage services where a client engages multiple brokers to service different portions of the clients account in addition third party capital providers have entered the insurance and reinsurance risk transfer market offering products and capital directly to our clients 

in our consulting segment we compete for business with numerous consulting firms and similar organizations many of whom also provide or are affiliated with firms that provided accounting information systems technology and financial services such competitors may be able to offer more comprehensive products and services to potential clients which may give them a competitive advantage 

consolidation in the industries we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate or combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work any of these or similar possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business the 

insurance industry continued to see robust market consolidation in 2017 and this trend could continue or accelerate in 2018 as insurance and reinsurance companies continue to consolidate guy carpenter’s smaller client base may be more susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the marketplace 

we rely on a large number of vendors and other third parties to perform key functions of our business operations and to provide services to our clients these vendors and third parties may act in ways that could harm our business 

we rely on a large number of vendors and other third parties and in some cases subcontractors to provide services data and information such as technology information security funds transfers data processing and administration and support functions that are critical to the operations of our business these third parties include correspondents agents and other brokers and intermediaries insurance markets data providers plan trustees payroll service providers software and system vendors health plan providers investment managers risk modeling providers outsourced providers of clientrelated services and providers of human resource functions such as recruiters as we do not fully control the actions of these third parties we are subject to the risk that their decisions or operations may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay and expense a failure by the third parties to comply with service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements in a high quality and timely manner particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services could result in economic and reputational harm to us in addition these third parties face their own technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information or failure to comply with applicable law could cause harm to our reputation or otherwise expose us to liability an interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints financial difficulties or for any other reason could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in contractual or regulatory penalties liability claims from clients or employees damage to our reputation and harm to our business 

business resiliency risks 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

if we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event such as an earthquake hurricane flood terrorist attack pandemic security breach cyberattack power loss or telecommunications failure our ability to operate will depend in part on the continued availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we could experience operational challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business the risk of business disruption is more pronounced in certain geographic areas including major metropolitan centers like new york or london where we have significant operations and approximately 3500 colleagues in each location and in certain countries and regions in which we operate that are subject to higher potential threat of terrorist attacks or military conflicts 

our operations depend in particular upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage if a business continuity event occurs we could lose client or company data or experience interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients which could have a material adverse effect a cyberattack or other business continuity event affecting us or a key vendor or other third party could result in a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or operations requiring us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues for example hackers have increasingly targeted companies by attacking internetconnected industrial control and safety control systems an extended outage could result in the loss of clients and a decline in our revenues 

we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession however a disaster or other continuity event on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover from such an event could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss loss 

of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships and legal liability our business disruption insurance may also not fully cover in type or amount   the cost of a successful recovery in the event of such a disruption 

financial risks 

the impacts from recentlypassed us federal tax reform remain uncertain 

on december 22 2017 president trump signed into law the tax legislation commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act the tcja that significantly changes the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the tcja which generally became effective on january 1 2018 revises the us tax code by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 limiting deductibility of interest expense and implementing a broadly territorial tax system the tcja also imposes a onetime repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries 

while the tcja is expected to have a favorable impact on our overall effective tax rate as reported under generally accepted accounting principles both in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 and subsequent reporting periods the legislation also resulted in aggregate provisional tax charges in the fourth quarter of 2017 of approximately 460 million primarily related to the remeasurement of the net us deferred tax asset and the deemed repatriation tax the tcja was enacted late in 2017 and limited implementation guidance was provided as clarified by the sec in staff accounting bulletin no 118 we made provisional estimates of the deemed repatriation tax impact moreover certain provisions of the tcja such as the base erosion and antiabuse tax and the global intangible lowtax income gilti provision and any adverse impacts from new guidance on the implementation of the tcja may create new pressure on our effective tax rate in future periods it is also currently unknown if and to what extent various states will conform to the tcja and the impact such changes in statetax law may have 

the estimated impacts of the new law are based on our current knowledge and assumptions and therefore the ultimate impacts remain uncertain given the significant complexity of the tcja anticipated guidance from the us treasury about implementing the tcja and the potential for new legislation or additional guidance from the securities and exchange commission the financial accounting standards board or other regulatory authorities related to the tcja recognized impacts in future periods could be significantly different from our current estimates such uncertainty may also result in increased scrutiny from or disagreements with tax authorities 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions political events and market conditions 

macroeconomic conditions political events and other market conditions around the world affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve these conditions may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing for those services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations changes in macroeconomic and political conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have a competitive advantage and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain for example recently there has been a move toward protectionist laws and business practices in some countries which could favor local competition and adversely affect our business in particular the united kingdom’s pending exit from the european union referred to as brexit continues to create political and economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom and the eu and this uncertainty may last for years our business in the united kingdom the eu and worldwide could be affected during this period of uncertainty and perhaps longer by the impact of the united kingdom’s referendum if the demand for our products and services declines as a result of these or any other macroeconomic conditions political events or market conditions we may be required to respond in a way which could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy 

our investments including our minority investments in other companies as well as our cash investments and those held in a fiduciary capacity are subject to general credit liquidity counterparty foreign exchange market and interest rate risks these risks may be exacerbated by global macroeconomic conditions market volatility and regulatory financial and other difficulties affecting the companies in which we have invested or that may be faced by financial institution counterparties during times of stress in the banking industry counterparty risk can quickly escalate potentially resulting in substantial trading and investment losses for corporate and other investors in addition we may incur investment losses as a 

result of unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may continue to experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels if the banking system or the fixed income interest rate credit or equity markets deteriorate the value and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected finally the value of the companys assets held in other jurisdictions including cash holdings may decline due to foreign exchange fluctuations 

if we are unable to collect our receivables our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for the work we perform as of december 31 2017 our receivables for our commissions and fees were approximately 38 billion or approximately onequarter of our total annual revenues macroeconomic or political conditions could result in financial difficulties for our clients which could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us in addition if we experience an increase in the time it takes to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms 

the maintenance and growth of our business the payment of dividends and our ability to make share repurchases rely on our access to capital which depends in large part on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of equity and debt financing certain of our businesses such as gc securities and mmc securities europe limited also rely on financings by us to fund debt and equity capital raising offerings by their clients there can be no assurance that our operations will generate sufficient positive cash flow to finance all of our capital needs or that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on favorable terms in addition our ability to obtain financing will depend in part upon prevailing conditions in credit and capital markets which are beyond our control 

our defined benefit pension plan obligations could cause the companys financial position earnings and cash flows to fluctuate 

our defined benefit pension obligations and the assets set aside to fund those obligations are sensitive to certain changes in the financial markets any such changes may result in increased pension expense or additional cash payments to fund these plans 

the company has significant defined benefit pension obligations to its current and former employees totaling approximately 163 billion and related plan assets of approximately 162 billion at december 31 2017 on a us gaap basis the companys policy for funding its defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth by law in the united states contributions to these plans are based on erisa guidelines outside the united states contributions are generally based on statutory requirements and local funding practices which may differ from measurements under us gaap in the uk for example the assumptions used to determine pension contributions are the result of legallyprescribed negotiations between the company and the plans trustee currently the use of these assumptions results in a lower funded status than determined under us gaap and may result in contributions irrespective of the us gaap funded status 

the financial calculations relating to our defined benefit pension plans are complex pension plan assets could decrease as the result of poor future asset performance also pension plan liabilities periodic pension expense and future funding amounts could increase as a result of a decline in the interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities longer lifespans than those reflected in our mortality assumptions actual investment return that is less than the expected return on assets adverse changes in laws or regulations and other variables 

while we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of pension volatility on our earnings and cash funding requirements these strategies may not be successful accordingly given the magnitude of our worldwide pension plans variations in or reassessment of the preceding or other factors or potential miscalculations relating to our defined benefit pension plans could cause significant fluctuation from year to year in our earnings and cash flow as well as our pension plan assets liabilities and equity and may result in increased levels of contributions to our pension plans 

our significant nonus operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business 

a significant portion of our business is located outside of the united states we are subject to exchange rate movement because we must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars and also because some of our subsidiaries receive revenue other than in their functional currencies exchange rate movements may change over time and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows reported in us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in certain jurisdictions however our risk and insurance services operations generate revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in local currency due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we are subject to economic exposure as well as currency translation exposure on the net operating results of our operations because the nonus based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 50 of total revenue exchange rate movement can have a significant impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow for additional discussion see market risk and credit riskforeign currency risk in part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this report 

we may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

the company is organized as a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries because we do not have significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations paying dividends to stockholders repurchasing our common stock under our share repurchase program and paying corporate expenses in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and make other payments to the company we may not be able to service our debt pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock or meet our other obligations 

further the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the united states funds from the current year’s earnings of the companys nonus operating subsidiaries are regularly repatriated to the united states a number of factors could arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or could make repatriation costprohibitive including but not limited to the imposition of currency controls and other government restrictions on repatriation in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the imposition of withholding and other taxes on such payments  

in the event we are unable to generate or repatriate cash from our operating subsidiaries our overall liquidity could deteriorate and our ability to finance our obligations including to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock could be adversely affected  

our quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly 

quarterly variations in revenues and operating results may occur due to several factors these include 



 a significant portion of our total operating expenses is relatively fixed in the short term therefore a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results for these businesses 

credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk 

currently the companys senior debt is rated a by sp and baa1 by moodys the ratings from both sp and moodys currently carry a stable outlook 

if we need to raise capital in the future for example in order to fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could limit our access to financing sources further a downgrade to a rating below investmentgrade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures 

global operations 

we are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations 

we conduct business globally in 2017 approximately 50 of the companys total revenue was generated from operations outside the united states and over onehalf of our employees were located outside the united states we expect to expand our nonus operations further 

the geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal economic operational market compliance and reputational risks these include among others risks relating to 



sanctions laws relating to countries such as cuba iran russia sudan and syria and anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010 

 acquisitions and dispositions risks 

we face risks when we acquire and dispose of businesses 

we have a history of making acquisitions and investments including a total of 111 in the period 20122017 we expect that acquisitions will continue to be a key part of our business strategy our success in this regard will depend on our ability to identify and compete for appropriate acquisition candidates and to complete the transactions we decide to pursue with favorable results as we typically acquire other professional services firms the success of our transactions is also highly dependent on the retention of the key employees of our acquisition targets 

while we intend that our acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability we cannot be certain that our past or future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations acquisitions involve special risks including accounting regulatory compliance tax information technology or human resources issues that could arise in connection with or as a result of the acquisition of the acquired company the assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies difficulties in integrating acquired businesses possible management distraction and the inability of acquired businesses to achieve the levels of revenue profit productivity or synergies we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect on the timeline contemplated in addition if in the future the performance of our reporting units or an acquired business varies from our projections or assumptions or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units or an acquired business change the estimated fair value of our reporting units or an acquired business could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill and other acquisitionrelated intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet or in adjustments in contingent payment amounts as of december 31 2017 the companys consolidated balance sheet reflected 104 billion of goodwill and intangible assets representing approximately 51 of the companys total consolidated assets and allocated by reporting segment as follows risk and insurance services 76 billion and consulting 28 billion given the significant size of the companys goodwill and intangible assets an impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given period 

when we dispose of businesses we may continue to be subject to certain liabilities of that business after its disposition relating to the period of our ownership and may not be able to negotiate for limitations on those liabilities we are also subject to the risk that the sales price is less than the amount reflected on our balance sheet 

risks relating to our risk and insurance services segment 

our risk and insurance services segment conducted through marsh and guy carpenter represented 54 of the companys total revenue in 2017 our business in this segment is subject to particular risks 

results in our risk and insurance services segment may be adversely affected by a general decline in economic activity 

demand for many types of insurance and reinsurance generally rises or falls as economic growth expands or slows this dynamic affects the level of commissions and fees generated by marsh and guy carpenter to the extent our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions they may choose to limit their purchases of insurance and reinsurance coverage as applicable which would inhibit our ability to generate commission revenue and other revenue based on premiums placed by us also the insurance they seek to obtain through us may be impacted by changes in their assets property values sales or number of employees which may reduce our commission revenue and they may decide not to purchase our risk advisory or other services which would inhibit our ability to generate fee revenue moreover insolvencies and combinations associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies and combinations in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by limiting our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business as well as our revenues from insurers guy carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the market place 

volatility or declines in premiums and other market trends may significantly impede our ability to grow revenues and profitability 

a significant portion of our risk and insurance services revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to the normal cycles of pricing in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

as traditional insurance companies continue to rely on nonaffiliated brokers or agents to generate premium those insurance companies may seek to reduce their expenses by lowering their commission rates the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility or declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes it is difficult to accurately forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result we may have to adjust our plans for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by disintermediation and the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their riskprotection needs this trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to selfinsure the use of captive insurers and the presence of capital marketsbased solutions for traditional insurance and reinsurance needs further the profitability of our risk and insurances services segment depends in part on our ability to be compensated for the analytical services and other advice that we provide including the consulting and analytics services that we provide to insurers if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for all of our services our margins and profitability could decline 

adverse legal developments and future regulations concerning how intermediaries are compensated by insurers or clients as well as allegations of anticompetitive behavior or conflicts of interest more broadly could have a material adverse effect on marsh’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the ways in which insurance intermediaries are compensated receive scrutiny from regulators in part because of the potential for anticompetitive behavior and conflicts of interest the vast majority of the compensation that marsh receives is in the form of retail fees and commissions that are paid by the client or paid from premium that is paid by the client the amount of other compensation that we receive from 

insurance companies separate from retail fees and commissions has increased in the last several years both on an underlying basis and through acquisition this other compensation includes payment for i consulting and analytics services provided to insurers ii administrative and other services provided to insurers including services relating to the administration and management of quota shares lineslips panels and other facilities and iii contingent commissions paid by insurers based on factors such as volume or profitability of marshs placements these other revenue streams present potential regulatory litigation and reputational risks that may arise from alleged anticompetitive behavior or conflicts of interest and future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect such revenue for example in november 2017 the fca announced the terms of reference for a market study concerning the london wholesale insurance broker sector which affects marsh and guy carpenter the fca is conducting the study to assess how effective competition is working in the wholesale insurance broker sector and how brokers influence competition in the underwriting sector many of the questions raised by the fca in the terms of reference relate to broker compensation and feegenerating business practices the fca is expected to publish its interim report in the fall of 2018 with a final report expected in 2019 the timing and impacts of the study remain uncertain and the study may lead to remedies on the industry that could adversely impact marsh or guy carpenter’s business these or other adverse regulatory legal or other developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and expose the company to negative publicity and reputational harm 

risks relating to our consulting segment 

our consulting segment conducted through mercer and oliver wyman group represented 46 of our total revenue in 2017 our businesses in this segment are subject to particular risks 

mercer’s investment management and related services ims business is subject to a number of risks including risks related to thirdparty investment managers operational risk conflicts of interest asset performance and regulatory compliance that if realized could result in significant damage to our business 

mercer’s ims business provides clients with investment consulting and investment management also referred to as delegated solutions or fiduciary management services in the investment consulting business clients make and implement their own investment decisions based upon advice provided by mercer in its delegated solutions business mercer implements the client’s investment policy by engaging and overseeing thirdparty asset managers who determine which investments to buy and sell to effect implementation of a client’s investment policy mercer may utilize its manager of managers investment funds 

mercer’s ims business is subject to a number of risks including risks related to thirdparties our operations conflicts of interest asset performance and regulatory compliance and scrutiny which could arise in connection with these offerings for example mercer’s due diligence on an asset manager may fail to uncover material deficiencies or fraud that could result in investment losses to a client there is a risk that mercer will fail to properly implement a client’s investment policy which could cause an incorrect or untimely allocation of client assets among asset managers or strategies mercer may also be perceived as recommending certain asset managers to clients or offering delegated solutions to an investment consulting client solely to enhance its own compensation asset classes may perform poorly or asset managers may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance a downturn in the global equity markets negligence or other reasons resulting in poor returns or loss of client capital these risks if realized could result in significant liability and damage our business in addition in june 2017 the fca issued a final report in connection with a market study of the uk asset management industry which includes asset managers and investment consultants including mercer following the report in september 2017 the fca announced its decision to refer the investment consulting and fiduciary management markets to the uk competition  markets authority the cma for a market investigation the cma expects to conclude its investigation of the investment consulting and fiduciary management markets by march 2019 and the cma may impose remedies on the industry that may adversely affect mercer’s uk investment consulting and delegated solutions businesses 

revenues for the services provided by our consulting segment may decline for various reasons including as a result of changes in economic conditions the value of equity debt and other asset markets our clients’ or an industrys financial condition or government regulation 

until recently global economic conditions have negatively affected businesses and financial institutions many of our clients including financial institutions corporations government entities and pension plans have reduced expenses including amounts spent on consulting services and used internal resources instead of consultants the evolving needs and financial circumstances of our clients may reduce demand for our consulting services and our revenues and profitability if the economy or markets in which we operate experience weakness or deteriorate our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition some of mercers ims business generates fees based upon the value of the clients’ assets under management or advisement changes in the value of equity debt currency real estate commodities or other asset classes could cause the value of assets under management or advisement and the fees received by mercer to decline such changes could also cause clients to withdraw funds from mercer’s ims business in favor of other investment service providers in either case our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected further revenue received by mercer as investment manager to the majority of the mercermanaged investment funds is reported in accordance with us gaap on a gross basis rather than a net basis with subadvisor fees reflected as an expense therefore the reported revenue for these offerings does not fully reflect the amount net revenue ultimately attributable to mercer 

demand for many of mercers benefits services is affected by government regulation and tax laws rulings policies and interpretations which drive our clients needs for benefitsrelated services significant changes in government regulations affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of mercers services 

factors affecting defined benefit pension plans and the services we provide relating to those plans could adversely affect mercer 

mercer currently provides corporate multiemployer and public clients with actuarial consulting and administration services relating to defined benefit pension plans the nature of our work is complex our actuarial services involve numerous assumptions and estimates regarding future events including interest rates used to discount future liabilities estimated rates of return for a plans assets healthcare cost trends salary projections and participants life expectancies our consulting services involve the drafting and interpretation of trust deeds and other complex documentation governing pension plans our administration services include calculating benefits within complicated pension plan structures clients dissatisfied with our services have brought and may bring significant claims against us particularly in the united states and the united kingdom in addition a number of mercers clients have frozen or curtailed their defined benefit plans and have moved to defined contribution plans resulting in reduced revenue for mercers retirement business these developments could adversely affect mercers business and operating results 

the profitability of our consulting segment may decline if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and pricing rates for our consultants 

the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on ensuring that our consultants maintain adequate utilization rates ie the percentage of our consultants working hours devoted to billable activities our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 



 if the utilization rate for our consulting professionals declines our profit margin and profitability could decline 

in addition the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on the prices we are able to charge for our services the prices we charge are affected by a number of factors including 

 if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for our services our profit margin and profitability could decline

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in april 2017 the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom the fca commenced a civil competition investigation into the aviation insurance and reinsurance sector in connection with that investigation the fca carried out an onsite inspection at the london office of marsh limited our marsh and guy carpenter operating subsidiary in the united kingdom the fca indicated that it had reasonable grounds for suspecting that marsh limited and other participants in the market have been sharing competitively sensitive information within the aviation insurance and reinsurance broking sector 

in october 2017 the company received a notice that the directorategeneral for competition of the european commission had commenced a civil investigation of a number of insurance brokers including marsh regarding the exchange of commercially sensitive information between competitors in relation to aviation and aerospace insurance and reinsurance broking products and services in the european economic area eea as well as possible coordination between competitors in light of the action 

taken by the european commission the fca informed marsh limited at the same time that it has discontinued its investigation under uk competition law into the aviation insurance and reinsurance sector 

in july 2017 the directorategeneral for competition of the european commission together with the irish competition and consumer protection commission conducted onsite inspections at the offices of marsh and other industry participants in dublin in connection with an investigation regarding the possible participation in anticompetitive agreements andor concerted practices contrary to eu competition law in the market for commercial motor insurance in the republic of ireland in december 2017 we received a request from the directorategeneral for competition of the european commission seeking documents and information relating to its investigation 

we are cooperating with these investigations and are conducting our own reviews as these investigations are at early stages we are unable to predict their likely timing outcome or ultimate impact there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these or any related matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows

consolidated results of operations 

in 2017 the company’s results of operations and earnings per share were impacted negatively in part as a result of two significant items in 2017 

 consolidated operating income increased 7 to 29 billion in 2017 compared with 27 billion in 2016 reflecting the combined impact of a 6 increase in revenue and a 6 increase in expenses as compared with the prior year income before income taxes increased 7 to 26 billion reflecting the increase in operating income partly offset by higher interest expense primarily reflecting an increase in average debt outstanding during the year resulting from the issuance of 1 billion of senior notes in january 2017 partly offset by the repayment of 250 million of senior notes in april 2017 

diluted earnings per share was 287 in 2017 compared with 338 in 2016 the decrease reflects a significantly higher effective tax rate in 2017 primarily resulting from an aggregate provisional charge of 460 million related to the enactment in december 2017 of us tax reform and a pension settlement charge which are discussed above the impact from us tax reform was partly offset by discrete tax items during the year in particular the benefit from the required change in accounting for tax consequences related to stock compensation the 460 million provisional charge related to us tax reform reduced diluted earnings per share by 089 

average diluted shares outstanding for 2017 decreased to 519 million compared with 524 million during 2016 shares issued related to the vesting of share awards and the exercise of employee stock options were more than offset by share repurchases during the year average shares outstanding in 2017 was also impacted by the change in accounting for stock compensation under the applicable guidance the excess tax benefits for unvested shares and unexercised stock options are no longer included in the calculation of common stock equivalents cses under the treasury stock method this had the effect of increasing cses by approximately 17 million shares in 2017 

risk and insurance services operating income increased 118 million or 7 in 2017 compared with 2016 revenue increased 7 reflecting a 3 increase on an underlying basis and a 4 increase from acquisitions expense increased 7 or 2 on an underlying basis in 2017 compared with 2016 

consulting operating income increased 71 million or 6 to 12 billion in 2017 compared with 2016 reflecting the combined impact of 5 growth for both revenue and expense 

consolidated operating income increased 10 to 27 billion in 2016 compared with 24 billion in 2015 reflecting the combined impact of a 2 increase in revenue and a 1 increase in expenses as compared to the prior year 

risk and insurance services operating income increased 214 million or 14 in 2016 compared with 2015 revenue increased 4 reflecting a 3 increase on an underlying basis and a 3 increase from acquisitions partly offset by a decrease resulting from the impact of foreign currency translation of 2 expense increased 1 in 2016 compared with 2015 

consulting operating income increased 28 million or 3 to 11 billion in 2016 compared with 2015 reflecting the combined impact of 1 revenue growth while expense was flat

the following table provides more detailed revenue information for certain of the components presented above 





revenue 

consolidated revenue was 14 billion  in 2017 an increase of 6  or 3  on an underlying basis revenue in the risk and insurance services segment increased 7  in 2017 compared with 2016 or 3  on an underlying basis revenue increased 3  and 4  on an underlying basis at marsh and guy carpenter respectively as compared with 2016 the consulting segments revenue increased 5  compared with 2016 or 4  on an underlying basis revenue increased 2  and 7  on an underlying basis at mercer and oliver wyman group respectively as compared with 2016 

consolidated revenue was 132 billion in 2016 an increase of 2 or 3 on an underlying basis revenue in the risk and insurance services segment increased 4 in 2016 compared with 2015 or 3 on an underlying basis revenue increased 3 and 2 on an underlying basis at marsh and guy carpenter respectively as compared with 2015 the consulting segments revenue increased 1 on a reported basis compared with 2015 or 3 on an underlying basis both mercer and oliver wyman groups revenue increased 3 on an underlying basis compared with 2015 

operating expense 

consolidated operating expenses increased 6 in 2017 compared with 2016 or 2 on an underlying basis the increase in underlying expenses was primarily due to higher base salaries and incentive compensation costs and the pension settlement charge discussed previously partly offset by lower costs related to liabilities for errors and omissions 

consolidated operating expenses increased 1 in 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 on both a reported and underlying basis the underlying expense increase reflects higher base salary costs higher amortization of identified intangible assets and the impact of the net benefit from the termination of the companys post65 retiree medical reimbursement plan in the united states the rra plan which was recorded in the first quarter of 2015 partly offset by decreases in defined benefit plan pension expense and contingent acquisition consideration expense 

risk and insurance services 

in the risk and insurance services segment the company’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers agents or consultants for insureds insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management insurance broking and insurance program management services primarily under the name of marsh and engage in reinsurance broking catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions primarily under the name of guy carpenter 

marsh and guy carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients or commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided the particular insurer or reinsurer the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiates with clients revenues can be affected by premium rate levels in the insurancereinsurance markets the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commissionbased compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insuredsreinsureds in many cases fee compensation may be negotiated in advance based on the type of risk coverage required and service provided by the company and ultimately the extent of the risk placed into the insurance market or retained by the client the trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next can be affected by changes in premium rate levels fluctuations in client risk retention and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured as well as new and lost business and the volume of business from new and existing clients 

marsh also receives other compensation from insurance companies separate from retail fees and commissions this compensation includes among other things payment for consulting and analytics services provided to insurers administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers including services relating to the administration and management of quota share panels and other facilities in which insurers participate and contingent commissions marsh and guy carpenter also receive interest income on certain funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others the investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities these regulations typically require segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates both of which vary from time to time for presentation purposes fiduciary interest is segregated from the other revenues of marsh and guy carpenter and separately presented within the segment as shown in the revenue by segments charts presented earlier in this mda

consulting 

effective january 1 2017 mercer merged its investment and retirement businesses into a newlycreated wealth business we believe this combination better aligns mercer’s investment management capabilities globally 

the company conducts business in its consulting segment through two main business groups mercer and oliver wyman group mercer provides consulting expertise advice services and solutions in the areas of health retirement talent and investments oliver wyman group provides specialized management economic and brand consulting services 

the major component of revenue in the consulting business is fees paid by clients for advice and services mercer principally through its health line of business also earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group and occasionally individual insurance contracts primarily life health and accident coverages revenue for mercer’s investment management business and certain of mercer’s defined contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under management or administration 

revenue in the consulting segment is affected by among other things global economic conditions including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets revenue is also affected by competition due to the introduction of new products and services broad trends in employee demographics including levels of employment the effect of government policies and regulations and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates revenues from the provision of investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by the level of assets under management or administration and securities market performance 

for the investment management business revenues from the majority of funds are included on a gross basis in accordance with us gaap and include reimbursable expenses incurred by professional staff and subadvisory fees and the related expenses are included in other operating expenses 

the results of operations for the consulting segment are presented below   



revenue 

consulting revenue in 2017 increased 5  compared with 2016 reflecting a 4  increase on an underlying basis and 2  growth from acquisitions mercers revenue increased 5  to 45 billion over the prior year or 2  on an underlying basis mercers year over year revenue comparison also reflects an increase of 2  from acquisitions the underlying revenue growth reflects an increase in career of 5  health of 2  and wealth of 2  within wealth investment management  related services increased 10  while defined benefit consulting  administration decreased 2 compared with the prior year oliver wyman group’s revenue increased 7  in 2017 compared with 2016 for both a reported and underlying basis

consulting revenue in 2016 increased 1 compared with 2015 reflecting a 3 increase on an underlying basis offset by a 2 decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation mercer’s revenue of 43 billion was flat when compared with 2015 but increased 3 on an underlying basis mercers year over year revenue comparison reflects a decrease of 2 from the impact of foreign currency translation the underlying revenue growth reflects an increase in wealth of 2 health of 3 and career of 5 within wealth investment management  related services increased 6 while defined benefit consulting  administration was flat compared with 2015 oliver wyman group’s revenue increased 2 in 2016 

compared with 2015 reflecting an increase of 3 on an underlying basis partly offset by a decrease of 2 from the impact of foreign currency translation 

the consulting segment completed six acquisitions during 2016  

expense 

consulting expense in 2017 increased 5 compared with 2016 reflecting an increase of 3 on an underlying basis and a 3 increase from the impact of acquisitions the increase in underlying expense reflects higher base salaries asset based fees and outside service costs partly offset by lower severance costs and lower costs related to liabilities for errors and omissions 

consulting expense in 2016 was essentially flat compared with 2015 reflecting an increase of 2 on an underlying basis offset by a 2 decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation the increase in underlying expense reflects higher base salaries and the impact of the net benefit from the termination of the rra plan which was recorded in the first quarter of 2015 partly offset by lower defined benefit plan pension expense 

corporate and other 

corporate expense in 2017 was 189 million compared with 192 million in 2016 the decrease in expense is primarily due to lower consulting occupancy and general insurance costs 

corporate expense in 2016 was 192 million compared with 195 million in 2015 reflecting lower executive compensation and lower defined benefit pension costs 



other corporate items 

interest 

interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to 9 million in 2017 compared with 5 million in 2016 interest expense in 2017 was 237 million compared with 189 million in 2016 the increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher average debt outstanding in 2017 

interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to 5 million in 2016 compared with 13 million in 2015 the decrease is due to the combined effects of a lower level of invested funds and lower interest rates interest expense in 2016 was 189 million compared with 163 million in 2015 due to higher average outstanding debt in 2016 

investment income 

the caption investment income loss in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments recognized in current earnings it includes when applicable otherthantemporary declines in the value of debt and availableforsale securities and equity method gains or losses on its investment in private equity funds the companys investments may include direct investments in insurance consulting and related companies and investments in private equity funds the company recorded net investment income of 15 million in 2017 compared to less than 1 million in 2016 and 38 million in 2015 the increase in 2017 versus 2016 was primarily due to a gain on the sale of an investment and higher equity method gains related to the companys investments in private equity funds net investment income in 2015 was primarily related to the general partner carried interest from trident iii stonepoint capital the investment manager of trident iii substantially liquidated the remaining two investments of trident iii during the third quarter of 2015 which resulted in the company recognizing its remaining deferred performance fees 

income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tcja the tcja provides for a reduction in the us corporate tax rate to 21 and the creation of a territorial tax system   the tcja also changes the deductibility of certain expenses primarily executive officers compensation the company recorded a provisional charge of 460 million related to the enactment of the tcja as discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements this provisional charge may be adjusted in 2018 the tcja provides for a transition to the territorial system via a transition tax on undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries the company recorded a provisional charge of 240 million in the fourth quarter as an estimate of us transition taxes and ancillary effects including state taxes and foreign withholding taxes related to the 

change in permanent reinvestment status with respect to our pre2018 foreign earnings this transition tax is payable over eight years the reduction of the us corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 reduces the value of the us deferred tax assets and liabilities accordingly a charge of 220 million was recorded the more complete discussion of the tcja and its impact on the company’s results is further below 

the companys consolidated effective tax rate was 429  276  and 291  in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the effective tax rate in 2017 reflects the provisional estimate of us tax reform as well as the impact of the required change in accounting for the tax effects of equity awards the 2017 2016 and 2015 rates also reflect foreign operations which historically have been taxed at rates below the us statutory tax rate including the effect of repatriation as well as the impact of discrete tax matters such as tax legislation changes in valuation allowances nontaxable adjustments to contingent acquisition consideration and the trueup of the tax provision to amounts filed in the companys tax returns in 2017 pretax income in the uk barbados canada australia and ireland accounted for approximately 60 of the companys total nonus pretax income with effective rates in those countries of 20 1 27 31 and 12 respectively 

as noted above the tcja significantly increased income tax expense from two discrete charges discussed above the lower us corporate rate is expected to provide a significant ongoing benefit to our effective tax rate and us cash tax liabilities due to the significantly lower us statutory tax rate and the quasiterritorial system 

as a us domiciled parent holding company marsh  mclennan companies inc is the issuer of essentially all of the companys external indebtedness and incurs the related interest expense in the us further most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the us and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the united states 

the mandatory taxation of accumulated undistributed foreign earnings through the transition tax substantially changed the economic considerations of continued permanent investment of those accumulated earnings a key component of our global capital strategy as a result of the transition tax the company anticipates repatriating the majority of the accumulated earnings that was previously intended to be permanently reinvested outside of the us we continue to evaluate our global investment strategy in light of expected relief from us tax reform under the new territorial tax regime for future foreign earnings 

the effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period the rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of the companys earnings and repatriation of cash which may result in higher or lower effective tax rates losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax assets the effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation 

the realization of deferred tax assets depends on generating future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable tax liabilities are determined and assessed jurisdictionally by legal entity or filing group certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings the company assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets the company considered all available evidence including the existence of a recent history of losses placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that the company believes is more likely than not to be realized 

changes in tax laws rulings policies or related legal and regulatory interpretations occur frequently and may also have significant favorable or adverse impacts on our current assumptions and effective tax rate 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company is organized as a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries as the company does not have significant operations of its own the company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt obligations pay dividends to stockholders repurchase its shares and pay corporate expenses the company also provides financial support to its operating subsidiaries for acquisitions investments and certain parts of their business that require liquidity such as the capital markets business of guy carpenter other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows 

the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the united states funds from those operating subsidiaries are regularly repatriated to the united states out of annual earnings at december 31 2017 the company had approximately 10 billion of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations which includes 171 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements the company expects to continue its practice of repatriating foreign funds from its nonus operating subsidiaries out of current annual earnings and with respect to repatriating 2017 and prior earnings it is in the process of fully evaluating such factors as its short and longterm capital needs acquisition and borrowing strategies and the availability of cash for repatriation for each of its subsidiaries as it considers its permanent reinvestment assertions going forward in light of the enactment at the end of 2017 of the tcja during 2017 the company recorded foreign currency translation adjustments which increased net equity by 715 million a weakening of the us dollar against foreign currencies would increase the translated us dollar value of the company’s net investments in its nonus subsidiaries as well as the translated us dollar value of cash repatriations from those subsidiaries 

cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the company 

operating cash flows 

the company generated 19 billion of cash from operations in 2017 compared with 20 billion in 2016 these amounts reflect the net income of the company during those periods excluding gains or losses from investments adjusted for noncash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments of accrued liabilities or receipts of assets and pension contributions 

pensionrelated items 

contributions 

during 2017 the company contributed 85 million to its us pension plans and 229 million to nonus pension plans compared to contributions of 27 million to us plans and 187 million to nonus plans in 2016 

in the united states contributions to the taxqualified defined benefit plans are based on erisa guidelines and the company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80 or more of the liability determined under the erisa guidelines there was a 6 million contribution to the us qualified plan to meet the erisa funding requirement in 2017 in addition the company made a 50 million discretionary contribution to the us qualified plan in december 2017 and 29 million of contributions to its nonqualified plans the company expects to contribute approximately 27 million to its us pension plans in 2018 

the company contributed 129 million to the uk plans in 2017 including an expense allowance of approximately 9 million based on the funding test carried out at november 1 2017 the company contributions to the uk plans in 2018 are expected to be approximately 22 million including the expense allowance 

outside the united states the company has a large number of nonus defined benefit pension plans the largest of which are in the uk which comprise approximately 81 of nonus plan assets at december 31 2017 contribution rates for nonus plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements which may differ significantly from measurements under us gaap in the uk the assumptions used to determine pension contributions are the result of legallyprescribed negotiations between the company and the plans trustee that typically occur every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans currently this results in a lower funded status than under us gaap and may result in contributions irrespective of the us gaap funded status in november 2016 the company and the trustee of the uk defined benefits plans agreed to a funding deficit recovery plan for the uk defined benefit pension plans the current agreement with the trustee sets out the annual deficit contributions which would be due based on the deficit at december 31 2015 the funding level is subject to reassessment in most cases on november 1 of each year if the funding 

level on november 1 is sufficient no deficit funding contributions will be required in the following year and the contribution amount will be deferred the funding level was reassessed on november 1 2017 and no deficit funding contributions are required in 2018 the funding level will be reassessed on november 1 2018 as part of a longterm strategy which depends on having greater influence over asset allocation and overall investment decisions in november 2016 the company renewed its agreement to support annual deficit contributions by the uk operating companies under certain circumstances up to gbp 450 million over a sevenyear period 

in the aggregate the company expects to contribute approximately 82 million  to its nonus defined benefit plans in 2018 comprising approximately 60 million to plans outside of the uk and 22 million to the uk plans 

changes to pension plans 

in march 2017 the company modified its defined benefit pension plans in canada to discontinue further benefit accruals for participants after december 31 2017 and replaced them with a defined contribution arrangement the company also amended its postretirement benefits plan in canada so that individuals who retire after april 1 2019 will not be eligible to participate except in certain situations the company remeasured the assets and liabilities of the plans based on assumptions and market conditions on the amendment date 

in october 2016 the company modified its us defined benefit pension plans to discontinue further benefit accruals for participants after december 31 2016 at the same time the company amended its us defined contribution retirement plans for most of its us employees to add an automatic company contribution equal to 4 of eligible base pay beginning on january 1 2017 this new company contribution together with the company’s current matching contribution provides eligible us employees with the opportunity to receive a total contribution of up to 7 of eligible base pay as required under gaap the defined benefit plans that were significantly impacted by the modification were remeasured in october 2016 using market data and assumptions as of the modification date the net periodic pension expense recognized in 2016 reflects the weighted average costs of the december 31 2015 measurement and the october 2016 remeasurement in addition the us qualified plans were merged effective december 30 2016 since no participants would be receiving benefit accruals after december 2016 

effective august 1 2015 the company amended its ireland defined benefit pension plans to close those plans to future benefit accruals and replaced those plans with a defined contribution arrangement the company remeasured the assets and liabilities of the plans based on assumptions and market conditions on the amendment date 

changes in funded status and expense 

the yearoveryear change in the funded status of the companys pension plans is impacted by the difference between actual and assumed results particularly with regard to return on assets and changes in the discount rate as well as the amount of company contributions if any unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately 18 billion and 26 billion at december 31 2017 for the us plans and nonus plans respectively compared with 17 billion and 31 billion at december 31 2016 the increase   in the us was primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities partly offset by investment returns the decrease in the nonus plans was primarily due to higher investment returns the impact of assumption changes and the uk settlement in the fourth quarter of 2017 as discussed above partly offset by the impact of a decrease in discount rates and foreign exchange translation in the past several years the amount of unamortized losses has been significantly impacted both positively and negatively by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities decreased in both the us and the uk the companys largest plans in 2017 and in 2016 the decreases in 2017 and 2016 followed an increase in 2015 an increase in the discount rate decreases the measured plan benefit obligation resulting in actuarial gains while a decrease in the discount rate increases the measured plan obligation resulting in actuarial losses during 2017 the companys defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 193 and 91 in the us and uk respectively during 2016 the companys defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 98 and 221 in the us and uk respectively during 2015 the companys defined benefit pension plan assets had a loss of 39 in the us and gain of 12 in the uk 

overall based on the measurement at december 31 2017 expenses related to the company’s defined benefit plans are expected to decrease in 2018 by approximately 90 million compared to 2017 approximately 80 million of the reduction relates to nonus plans primarily in the uk and in canada in the uk the net benefit credit was reduced in 2017 by the 54 million settlement charge discussed previously the recognition of a similar charge in 2018 and the amount of such a charge if any is dependent upon whether participant lump sum elections reach or exceed the settlement threshold the remaining decrease primarily relates to plans in canada which ceased the accrual of future benefits on january 1 2018 approximately half of the defined benefit expense decrease in canada will be offset by increased costs for contributions to its defined contribution plans 

historically service and interest costs were estimated using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curves used to measure the benefit obligations at the beginning of the period in 2016 the company changed the approach used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its significant nonus plans this change in approach was made to improve the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs the change did not impact the measurement of the plans’ total projected benefit obligation the company accounted for this change as a change in estimate that was applied prospectively beginning in 2016 and resulted in pension expense being approximately 45 million lower than if the prior approach had been used 

the company’s accounting policies for its defined benefit pension plans including the selection of and sensitivity to assumptions are discussed below under management’s discussion of critical accounting policies for additional information regarding the company’s retirement plans see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

in march 2015 the company amended the rra resulting in its termination with benefits to certain participants to be paid through december 31 2016 as a result of the termination of the rra plan the company recognized a net credit of approximately 125 million in the first quarter of 2015

debt 

the company increased outstanding debt by approximately 680 million in 2017 and 400 million in 2016

management’s discussion of critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from those estimates 

legal and other loss contingencies 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions eo gaap requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance the company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel an internal actuarial analysis by oliver wyman group a subsidiary of the company and other methods to estimate potential losses the liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable given the unpredictability of eo claims and of litigation that could flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the company’s businesses results of operations financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period 

in addition to the extent that insurance coverage is available significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the company’s various insurance programs 

retirement benefits 

the company maintains qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible us employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible nonus employees the company’s policy for funding its taxqualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable foreign laws 

the company recognizes the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci net of tax in the company’s consolidated balance sheets the gains and losses that exceed specified corridors are amortized prospectively out of aoci over a period that approximates the remaining life expectancy of participants in plans where substantially all participants are inactive or the average remaining service period of active participants for plans with active participants the vast majority of unrecognized losses relate to inactive plans and are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the participants 

the determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate mortality and assumed rate of salary increase the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements the assumptions for expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate are discussed in more detail below 

the longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption is determined for each plan based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of the measurement date and the specific portfolio mix of each plan’s assets the company utilizes a model developed by mercer a subsidiary of the company to assist in the determination of this assumption the model takes into account several factors including actual and target portfolio allocation investment administrative and trading expenses incurred directly by the plan trust historical portfolio performance relevant forwardlooking economic analysis and expected returns variances and correlations for different asset classes these measures are used to determine probabilities using standard statistical techniques to calculate a range of expected returns on the portfolio 

the target asset allocation for the us plans is 64  equities and equity alternatives and 36  fixed income at december 31 2017 the actual allocation for the us plans was 63  equities and equity alternatives and 37  fixed income at the end of 2016 the target asset allocation for the uk plans which comprise approximately 81  of nonus plan assets was 48  equities and equity alternatives and 52  fixed income during 2017 due to improvement in the funded status of the uk plans the trustee revised the target asset allocation to 34  equities and equity alternatives and 66  fixed income at december 31 2017 the actual allocation for the uk plans was 48  equities and equity alternatives and 52  fixed income and the company expects to continue to move the actual portfolio allocation toward the revised targets during 2018 

the discount rate selected for each us plan is based on a model bond portfolio with coupons and redemptions that closely match the expected liability cash flows from the plan discount rates for nonus plans are based on appropriate bond indices adjusted for duration in the uk the plan duration is reflected using the mercer yield curve 

the table below shows the weighted average assumed rate of return and the discount rate at the december 31 2017 measurement date for measuring pension expense in 2018 for the total company the us and the rest of world row 



holding all other assumptions constant a halfpercentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the us and uk plans which together comprise approximately 85 of total pension plan liabilities as follows 



the impact of discount rate changes shown above relates to the increase or decrease in actuarial gains   or losses being amortized through net periodic pension cost as well as the increase or decrease in interest expense with all other facts and assumptions held constant it does not contemplate nor include potential future impacts a change in the interest rate environment and discount rates might cause such as the impact on the market value of the plans’ assets changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant also may not be representative of the impact on expense because the longterm rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost 

the company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees the cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the us is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire but is funded by the company as incurred the key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the companys t ax rate reflects its income statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates in 2017 the companys tax expense was significantly impacted by the enactment of the tcja which is discussed in more detail in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions the company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the evaluation of a tax position is a twostep process the first step involves recognition the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on only the technical merits of the position the technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes legislative intent regulations rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position if a tax position does not meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 

uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue 

certain items are included in the companys tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities which are measured at existing tax rates deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements the company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company also considers tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carryback of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law the underlying assumptions the company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the companys recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carryforwards are deductible or creditable valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction 

fair value determinations 

goodwill impairment testing—the company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred the company performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year in accordance with applicable accounting guidance the company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the company considered numerous factors which included that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin in its most recent estimate of reporting unit fair values whether significant acquisitions or dispositions occurred which might alter the fair value of its reporting units macroeconomic conditions and their potential impact on reporting unit fair values actual performance compared with budget and prior projections used in its estimation of reporting unit fair values industry and market conditions and the yearoveryear change in the company’s share price 

the company completed its qualitative assessment in the third quarter of 2017 and concluded that a twostep goodwill impairment test was not required in 2017 and that goodwill was not impaired 

sharebased payment 

the guidance for accounting for sharebased payments requires among other things that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values in addition management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards as defined by the accounting guidance 

as of december 31 2017 there was  149 million  of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards the weightedaverage period over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 136  years also as of december 31 2017 there was  1974 million  of unrecognized compensation cost related to the company’s restricted stock restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards the weightedaverage period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is approximately 108  years

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk and credit risk 

certain of the company’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets 

interest rate risk and credit risk 

interest income generated from the company’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates 

the company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates   



based on the above balances if shortterm interest rates increased or decreased by 10 or 11 basis points over the full year annual interest income including interest earned on fiduciary funds would increase or decrease by approximately 4 million 

in addition to interest rate risk our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counterparty credit risk to minimize this risk the company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a board approved investment policy the policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counterparty limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment the company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions the majority of cash and fiduciary fund investments are invested in shortterm bank deposits and liquid money market funds 

foreign currency risk 

the translated values of revenue and expense from the company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates the nonus based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 50  of total revenue we periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business although the company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location as such under normal circumstances the us dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the us dollar generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk however there have been periods where the impact was not mitigated due to external market factors and external macroeconomic events such as the vote on brexit in the united kingdom may result in greater foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future if foreign exchange rates of major currencies euro sterling australian dollar and canadian dollar moved 10 in the same direction against the us dollar compared with the foreign exchange rates in 2017  the company estimates net operating income would increase or decrease by approximately 60 million the company has exposure to approximately 80 foreign currencies overall in continental europe the largest amount of revenue from renewals for the risk  insurance services segment occurs in the first quarter 

equity price risk 

the company holds investments in both public and private companies as well as private equity funds investments of approximately 97 million are classified as available for sale which includes the companys investment in benefitfocus approximately 62 million are accounted for using the cost method and  405 million  are accounted for using the equity method which includes the companys 

investments in alexander forbes the investments are subject to risk of changes in market value which if determined to be other than temporary could result in realized impairment losses the company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements 

as of december 31 2017 the carrying value of the company’s investment in alexander forbes was  266 million  as of december 31 2017 the market value of the approximately 443 million  shares of alexander forbes owned by the company based on the december 31 2017 closing share price of 687  south african rand per share was approximately  239 million

regulation 

the companys activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under us federal and state laws as well as laws of other countries in which the companys subsidiaries operate see part i item 1a risk factors below for a discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our businesses 

risk and insurance services  while laws and regulations vary from location to location every state of the united states and most foreign jurisdictions require insurance market intermediaries and related service providers such as insurance brokers agents and consultants reinsurance brokers and managing general agents to hold an individual or company license from a government agency or selfregulatory 

organization some jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locallyowned business entities in those instances if the company has no licensed subsidiary it may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction such arrangements are subject to an internal review and approval process licensing of reinsurance intermediaries is generally less rigorous compared to that of insurance brokers and most jurisdictions require only corporate reinsurance intermediary licenses 

the insurance mediation directive was adopted by the united kingdom and 26 other european union member states in 2005 its implementation gave powers to the financial services authority fsa the united kingdom regulator at the time to expand their responsibilities in line with the financial services and markets act the result of which was the regulation of insurance and reinsurance intermediaries the enhanced regulatory regime implemented in the united kingdom created a licensing system based on an assessment of factors which included professional competence financial capacity and the requirement to hold professional indemnity insurance in april 2013 the fsa was superseded by the financial conduct authority fca in april 2014 the fca’s responsibilities were expanded further to include the regulation of credit activities for consumers this included the broking of premium finance to consumers who wished to spread the cost of their insurance in april 2015 the fca obtained concurrent competition powers enabling them to enforce prohibitions on anticompetitive behavior in relation to financial services 

insurance authorities in the united states and certain other jurisdictions in which the companys subsidiaries do business including the fca in the united kingdom also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others these laws and regulations typically provide for segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them and generally apply to both the insurance and reinsurance business the fca is currently reviewing its rules governing the protection of client assets and client money if deemed appropriate the fca will implement changes intended to provide enhanced protection to client funds 

certain of the companys risk and insurance services activities are governed by other regulatory bodies such as investment securities and futures licensing authorities in the united states marsh and guy carpenter use the services of mmc securities llc a sec registered brokerdealer in the united states investment adviser and introducing broker mmc securities llc is a member of the financial industry regulatory authority finra the national futures association and the securities investor protection corporation sipc primarily in connection with capital markets and other investment bankingrelated services relating to insurancelinked and alternative risk financing transactions also in the united states marsh uses the services of mma securities llc a sec registered brokerdealer and member of finra sipc and the municipal securities rulemaking board primarily in connection with retirement executive compensation and benefits consulting and advisory services to qualified and nonqualified benefits plans companies and executives in the united kingdom marsh and guy carpenter use the expertise of mmc securities europe limited which is authorized and regulated by the fca to provide advice on securities and investments including mergers  acquisitions in the european union mmc securities llc mmc securities europe limited and mma securities llc are indirect whollyowned subsidiaries of marsh  mclennan companies inc

its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to the same licensing requirements and regulatory oversight as the insurance market intermediaries described above regarding our risk and insurance services businesses mercer uses the services of mmc securities llc to provide certain retirement and employee benefit services oliver wyman group uses the services of mmc securities europe limited in the european union primarily in connection with corporate finance advisory services 

fatca    regulations promulgated by the us treasury department pursuant to the foreign account tax compliance act and related legislation fatca require the company to take various measures relating to nonus funds transactions and accounts the regulations impose on mercer certain client financial account tracking and disclosure obligations with respect to nonus financial institution and insurance clients and require marsh and guy carpenter and mercer in limited circumstances to collect validate and maintain certain documentation from each foreign insurance entity that insures a risk that is subject to the regulations as of january 1 2017 fatca expanded to regulate a broader set of insurance and reinsurance placements known as foreigntoforeign transactions the company has adopted processes to substantially address fatca’s requirements

risk and insurance services  the companys combined insurance and reinsurance services businesses are global in scope our insurance and reinsurance businesses compete principally on sophistication range quality and cost of the services and products they offer to clients the company encounters strong competition from other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis from a large number of regional and local firms in the united states the european union and elsewhere from insurance and reinsurance companies that market distribute and service their insurance and reinsurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses including commercial and investment banks accounting firms consultants and online platforms that provide riskrelated services and products or alternatives to traditional insurance brokerage services in addition third party capital providers have entered the insurance and reinsurance risk transfer market offering products and capital directly to the company’s clients their presence in the market increases the competitive pressures that the company faces 

certain insureds and groups of insureds have established programs of self insurance including captive insurance companies as a supplement or alternative to thirdparty insurance thereby reducing in some cases their need for insurance placements certain insureds also obtain coverage directly from insurance providers there are also many other providers of managing general agency affinity programs and private client services including specialized firms insurance companies and other institutions 

consulting  the companys consulting and hr outsourcing businesses face strong competition from other privately and publicly held worldwide and national companies as well as regional and local firms these businesses generally compete on the basis of the range quality and cost of the services and products they provide to clients competitors include independent consulting and outsourcing firms as well as consulting and outsourcing operations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms mercers investments business faces competition from many sources including investment consulting firms many of which offer delegated services and other financial institutions in some cases clients have the option of handling the services provided by mercer and oliver wyman group internally without assistance from outside advisors

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information presented in this report these risks have the potential to materially adversely affect the companys business results of operations or financial condition 

risks relating to the company generally 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from errors and omissions breach of fiduciary duty and similar claims 

our operating companies provide numerous professional services including the placement of insurance and the provision of consulting investment advisory and actuarial services to clients around the world as a result the company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of errors and omissions breach of fiduciary duty and similar claims which we refer to collectively as eo claims in our risk and insurance services segment such claims include allegations of damages arising from our failure to assess clients’ risks advise clients place coverage or notify insurers of potential claims on behalf of clients in accordance with our obligations to them in our consulting segment where we increasingly act in a fiduciary capacity through our investments business such claims include allegations of damages arising from the provision of consulting investments actuarial pension administration and other services these services frequently involve complex calculations and other analysis including i making assumptions about and preparing estimates concerning   contingent future events ii drafting and interpreting complex documentation governing pension plans iii calculating benefits within complex pension structures  iv providing investment advice including guidance on asset allocation and investment strategy and v managing client assets including the selection of investment managers these matters often relate to services provided by the company dating back many years such claims may subject us to significant liability for monetary damages including punitive and treble damages negative publicity and reputational harm   and may divert personnel and management resources we may be unable to effectively limit our potential liability in certain jurisdictions including through insurance or in connection with certain types of claims particularly those concerning claims of a breach of fiduciary duty 

in establishing liabilities for eo claims in accordance with fasb asc subtopic no 45020 contingencies  loss contingencies the company uses case level reviews by inside and outside counsel an internal actuarial analysis by oliver wyman group a subsidiary of the company and other methods to estimate potential losses a liability is established when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable the liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable given the challenges inherent in establishing liabilities in accordance with fasb asc subtopic no 45020 as well as the unpredictability of eo claims and the litigation that can flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations or financial condition in a given quarterly or annual period 

further and as more fully described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item 8 of this report we are subject to legal proceedings regulatory investigations and other contingencies other than eo claims which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we cannot guarantee that we are or will be in compliance with all current and potentially applicable us federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states and its various states the european union and its member states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate for example we are subject to regulation by agencies such as the securities and exchange commission in the united states and the financial conduct authority the “fca” in the united kingdom state insurance regulators in the united states and selfregulatory organizations such as finra as further described 

above under part i item 1  business regulation of this report we are also subject to trade sanctions laws relating to countries such as cuba iran russia sudan and syria and anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk antibribery act we are subject to numerous other laws on matters as diverse as internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures securities regulation data privacy and protection taxation antitrust immigration wageandhour standards and employment and labor relations 

the us and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our operations are complex and our efforts to comply with them require significant resources in some cases these laws and regulations may impose operational limitations on our business including on the products and services we may offer or on the amount or type of compensation we may collect while we attempt to comply with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we our employees our consultants and our contractors and other agents are in full compliance with such laws and regulations or interpretations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws or regulations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations including those referred to above we may be subject to investigations criminal penalties or civil remedies including fines injunctions loss of an operating license or approval increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in a particular business or redress to clients the cost of compliance and the consequences of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition a failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company by exposing us to negative publicity and reputational damage or by harming our client or employee relationships 

in most jurisdictions government regulatory authorities have the power to interpret and amend applicable laws and regulations and have discretion to grant renew and revoke the various licenses and approvals we need to conduct our activities such authorities may require the company to incur substantial costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations in some areas of our businesses we act on the basis of our own or the industrys interpretations of applicable laws or regulations which may conflict from state to state or country to country in the event those interpretations eventually prove different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities we may be penalized or precluded from carrying on our previous activities moreover the laws and regulations to which we are subject may conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate which increases the likelihood of our businesses being noncompliant in one or more jurisdictions 

cybersecurity and data protection risks 

we could incur significant liability or our reputation could be damaged if our information systems are breached or we otherwise fail to protect client or company data or information systems 

we rely on the efficient uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business and securely process transmit and store electronic information in the normal course of business we also share electronic information with our vendors and other third parties this electronic information comprises sensitive and confidential data including information related to financial records health care mergers and acquisitions and clients’ personal data our information technology systems and those of our numerous thirdparty providers are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of external threats including cyberattacks computer viruses and other malware ransomware and other types of security breaches our systems are also subject to compromise from internal threats such as improper action by employees vendors and other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems the latency of such attacks is often measured in months and we may not be able to detect an attack in a timely manner we could experience significant financial and reputational harm if our information systems are breached or sensitive client or company data are compromised 

we are at risk of attack by a growing list of adversaries including by statesponsored organizations organized crime hackers or hactivists activist hackers through use of increasingly sophisticated methods of attack including longterm persistent attacks referred to as advanced persistent threats because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these 

techniques or implement adequate preventative measures resulting in potential data loss or other damage to information technology systems 

as the breadth and complexity of our infrastructure continues to grow including as a result of the use of mobile technologies cloud services social media and the increased reliance on devices connected to the internet known as the internet of things the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks also increases despite ongoing efforts to improve our ability to protect data from theft we may not be able to protect all of our data across our diverse systems should an attacker gain access to our network using compromised credentials of an authorized user we are at risk that the attacker might successfully leverage that access to compromise additional systems and data certain measures that could increase the security of our infrastructure such as data encryption or deployment of multifactor authentication take significant time and resources to deploy broadly and such measures may not be effective against an attack the inability to implement maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could have a material adverse effect on our business 

due to the large number and age of the systems and platforms that we operate the increased frequency at which vendors issue security patches to their products the need to test patches and in some cases coordinate with clients and vendors before they can be deployed we are at risk that we cannot deploy patches in a timely manner we are also dependent on third party vendors like cloud service providers to keep their systems patched in order to protect our data if we our clients and our vendors are unable to keep systems patched in a timely manner they may be breached which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we have numerous vendors and other third parties who receive personal information from us in connection with the services we offer our clients a small percentage of them have direct access to our systems we are at risk of a cyberattack involving a vendor or other third party which could result in a breakdown of such third party’s data protection processes or the cyberattackers gaining access to our infrastructure through the third party to the extent that a vendor or third party suffers a cyberattack that compromises their operations we could incur significant costs and possible service interruption which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have a history of making acquisitions and investments including 115 in the period from 20112016 the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk for instance we may not adequately identify weaknesses in the target’s information systems either before or after the acquisition which could affect the value we are able to derive from the acquisition expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to a cyberattack we may also be unable to integrate the systems of the businesses we acquire into our environment in a timely manner which could further increase these risks until such integration takes place 

our policies procedures and technical safeguards may be insufficient to prevent or detect improper access to confidential personal or proprietary information by employees vendors or other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems improper access to or disclosure of sensitive client or company information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts as well as under existing or future laws rules and regulations 

we have from time to time experienced data incidents and cybersecurity breaches such as malware incursions including computer viruses and ransomware users exceeding their data access authorization employee misconduct and incidents resulting from human error such as loss of portable and other data storage devices like many companies we are subject to regular phishing email campaigns directed at our employees that can result in malware infections and data losses although these incidents have resulted in data loss and other damages to date they have not had a material adverse effect on our business or operations in the future these types of incidents could result in confidential personal or proprietary information being lost or stolen including client employee or company data which could have a material adverse effect on our business we also may be unable to detect an incident assess its severity or impact or appropriately respond in a timely manner in addition our liability insurance which includes cyber insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches cyber  attacks and other related breaches  

the costs to comply with or our failure to comply with us and foreign laws related to privacy data security and data protection such as the eu general data protection regulation could adversely affect our financial condition operating results and our reputation 

in providing services and solutions to clients we store and transfer sensitive client or company data including personal data in and across multiple jurisdictions we leverage systems and applications that are spread all over the world requiring us to regularly move data across national borders as a result we are or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing the scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example in april 2016 the european commission adopted the general data protection regulation gdpr which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of its laws and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data such as the public disclosure of significant data breaches privacy impact assessments data portability and the appointment of data protection officers in some cases other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders at a state level the new york state department of financial services has issued cybersecurity regulations which impose an array of detailed security measures on covered entities all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time and may restrict the way services involving data are offered all of which may adversely affect our results of operations    

unauthorized disclosure or transfer of sensitive or confidential client or company data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation by the company our vendors or other parties with whom we do business could subject us to significant litigation monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines and criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions for example under the gdpr violations could result in a fine of up to 4 of a corporation’s global annual revenue such events could also result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation and cause us to lose clients which could therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competitive risks   

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses 

as a global professional services firm the company faces intense sustained competition in each of its operating segments our ability to compete successfully depends on a variety of factors including the quality and expertise of our colleagues our geographic reach the sophistication and quality of our services our pricing relative to competitors our customers ability to selfinsure or use internal resources instead of consultants known as disintermediation and our ability to respond to changes in client demand and industry conditions some of our competitors may have greater financial resources or may be better positioned to respond to technological and other changes in the industries we serve and they may be able to compete more effectively if we are unable to respond successfully to the competition we face our business results of operations and financial condition will be adversely impacted 

as a usdomiciled company our consolidated effective tax rate is higher than a number of our key competitors that are domiciled outside the united states where corporate tax rates are lower than the us federal statutory tax rate certain of our businesses such as marsh  mclennan agency also operate primarily in the united states where their earnings are subject to higher tax rates the higher consolidated tax rate at which our earnings are taxed could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete with a number of our competitors additionally the tax laws rulings policies or related legal and regulatory interpretations of the us and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our tax rate 

in our risk and insurance services segment in addition to the challenges posed by capital market alternatives to traditional insurance and reinsurance we compete intensely against a wide range of other insurance and reinsurance brokerage and risk advisory firms that operate on a global regional national or local scale for both client business and employee talent we also compete with insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or other market intermediaries and with various other companies that provide riskrelated services or alternatives to traditional brokerage services including through technological solutions this competition is intensified by an industry trend toward a syndicated or distributed approach to the 

purchase of insurance and reinsurance brokerage services where a client engages multiple brokers to service different portions of the clients account in addition third party capital providers have entered the insurance and reinsurance risk transfer market offering products and capital directly to our clients their presence in the market increases the competitive pressures that we face 

in our consulting segment we compete for business with numerous consulting firms and similar organizations many of whom also provided or are affiliated with firms that provided accounting information systems technology and financial services such competitors may be able to offer more comprehensive products and services to potential clients which may give them a competitive advantage 

the loss of key professionals could hurt our ability to retain existing client revenues and generate revenues from new business 

across all of our businesses our colleagues are critical to developing and retaining the client relationships as well as performing the services on which our revenues depend it is therefore important for us to attract incentivize and retain significant revenueproducing employees and the key managerial and other professionals who support them in addition we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team we face numerous challenges in this regard including the intense competition for talent and the general mobility of professionals 

losing employees who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements which could adversely affect our results of operations and subject to applicable enforceable restrictive covenants if a key employee were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology in driving value for our clients 

to remain competitive in many of our business areas we must anticipate and respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological change the threat comes from traditional players through disintermediation as well as from new entrants we must also identify relevant technologies and methodologies and integrate them into our product and service offerings we may not be able to do this effectively additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses and we may not make sufficient investments necessary to realize these goals 

we have a number of strategic initiatives involving investments in technology systems and infrastructure to support our growth strategy in addition to new platforms and systems we are deploying new processes and many of our colleagues across the business are changing the way they perform certain roles to capture efficiencies these initiatives may not yield sufficient return to cover the investments they require in some cases we depend on key vendors and partners to provide technology and other support for our strategic initiatives if these vendors or partners fail to perform their obligations or otherwise cease to work with us our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected if we do not keep up with technological changes or execute well on our strategic initiatives our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation is one of our key assets we advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices financial condition and other subjective qualities negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters or others could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and maintain existing ones as mentioned above negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us in any number of activities or circumstances including operations regulatory compliance and the use and protection of data and systems satisfaction of client expectations and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct this damage to our reputation could further affect the confidence of our clients rating agencies regulators stockholders and the other parties in a wide range 

of transactions that are important to our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

consolidation in the industries we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate or combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work any of these or similar possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business the insurance industry saw increased market consolidation in 2016 and this trend could continue or accelerate in 2017 as the insurance and reinsurance companies continue to consolidate guy carpenter’s smaller client base may be more susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the marketplace 

we rely on a large number of vendors and other third parties to perform key functions of our business operations and to provide services to our clients these vendors and third parties may act in ways that could harm our business 

we rely on a large number of vendors and other third parties and in some cases subcontractors to provide services data and information such as technology information security funds transfers data processing and administration and support functions that are critical to the operations of our business these third parties include correspondents agents and other brokers and intermediaries insurance markets data providers plan trustees payroll service providers software and system vendors health plan providers investment managers risk modeling providers outsourced providers of clientrelated services and providers of human resource functions such as recruiters as we do not fully control the actions of these third parties we are subject to the risk that their decisions or operations may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay and expense a failure by the third parties to comply with service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements in a high quality and timely manner particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services could result in economic and reputational harm to us in addition these third parties face their own technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information or failure to comply with applicable law could cause harm to our reputation or otherwise expose us to liability an interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints financial difficulties or for any other reason could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in contractual or regulatory penalties liability claims from clients or employees damage to our reputation and harm to our business 

financial risks 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions political events and market conditions 

macroeconomic conditions and political events around the world affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve these conditions may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing for those services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations changes in macroeconomic and political conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have a competitive advantage and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain for example recently there has been a move toward protectionist laws and business practices in some countries which could favor local competition and adversely affect our business in particular on june 23 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum and voted in favor of leaving the european union or eu referred to as brexit brexit has created political and economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom and the eu and this uncertainty may last for years our business in the united kingdom the eu and worldwide could be affected during this period of uncertainty and perhaps longer by the impact of the united kingdom’s referendum in addition as a result of the recent change of administration in the united states changes in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development and investment in the territories and countries 

where we currently do business and any negative sentiments toward the united states as a result of such changes could adversely affect our business further concerns persist regarding the economic health and political stability of certain eurozone countries if the demand for our products and services declines as a result of these or any other macroeconomic conditions political events or market conditions we may be required to respond in a way which could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy 

our investments including our minority investments in other companies as well as our cash investments and those held in a fiduciary capacity are subject to general credit liquidity counterparty foreign exchange market and interest rate risks these risks may be exacerbated by global macroeconomic conditions market volatility and regulatory financial and other difficulties affecting the companies in which we have invested or that may be faced by financial institution counterparties during times of stress in the banking industry counterparty risk can quickly escalate potentially resulting in substantial trading and investment losses for corporate and other investors in addition we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may continue to experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels if the banking system or the fixed income interest rate credit or equity markets deteriorate the value and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected finally the value of the companys assets held in other jurisdictions including cash holdings may decline due to foreign exchange fluctuations 

if we are unable to collect our receivables our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for the work we perform accounts receivable typically total about onequarter of our total annual revenues and as of december 31 2016 our accounts receivable were approximately 34 billion macroeconomic conditions could result in financial difficulties for our clients which could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of or be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time it takes to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 

the maintenance and growth of our business the payment of dividends and our ability to make share repurchases depend on our access to capital which depends in large part on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of equity and debt financing certain of our businesses such as gc securities and mmc securities europe limited also rely on financings by us to fund debt and equity capital raising offerings by their clients there can be no assurance that our operations will generate sufficient positive cash flow to finance all of our capital needs or that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on favorable terms or at all in addition our ability to obtain financing will depend in part upon prevailing conditions in credit and capital markets which are beyond our control 

our defined benefit pension plan obligations could cause the companys financial position earnings and cash flows to fluctuate 

our defined benefit pension obligations and the assets set aside to fund those obligations are sensitive to certain changes in the financial markets any such changes may result in increased pension expense or additional cash payments to fund these plans 

the company has significant defined benefit pension obligations to its current and former employees totaling approximately 156 billion and related plan assets of approximately 144 billion at december 31 2016 on a us gaap basis the companys policy for funding its defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth by law in the united states contributions to these plans are based on erisa guidelines outside the united states contributions are generally based on statutory requirements and local funding practices which may differ 

from measurements under us gaap in the uk for example the assumptions used to determine pension contributions are the result of legallyprescribed negotiations between the company and the plans trustee currently this results in a lower funded status than under us gaap and may result in contributions irrespective of the us gaap funded status 

the financial calculations relating to our defined benefit pension plans are complex pension plan assets could decrease as the result of poor future asset performance also pension plan liabilities periodic pension expense and future funding amounts could increase as a result of a decline in the interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities longer lifespans than those reflected in our mortality assumptions actual investment return that is less than the expected return on assets adverse changes in laws or regulations and other variables 

while we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of pension volatility on our earnings and cash funding requirements these strategies may not be successful accordingly given the magnitude of our worldwide pension plans variations in or reassessment of the preceding factors or potential miscalculations relating to our defined benefit pension plans could cause significant fluctuation from year to year in our earnings and cash flow as well as our pension plan assets liabilities and equity and may result in increased levels of contributions to our pension plans 

our significant nonus operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business 

a significant portion of our business is located outside of the united states we are subject to exchange rate movement because some of our subsidiaries receive revenue other than in their functional currencies and because we must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars these movements may change over time and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in certain jurisdictions however our risk and insurance services operations generate revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in local currency due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we are subject to economic exposure as well as currency translation exposure on the net operating results of our operations because the nonus based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 50 of total revenue exchange rate movement can have a significant impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow for additional discussion see market risk and credit riskforeign currency risk in part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this report 

we may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

the company is organized as a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries because we do not have significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations paying dividends to stockholders repurchasing our common stock under our share repurchase program and paying corporate expenses in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and make other payments to the company we may not be able to service our debt pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock or meet our other obligations 

further the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the united states funds from the current year’s earnings of the companys nonus operating subsidiaries are regularly repatriated to the united states a number of factors could arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or could make repatriation costprohibitive including but not limited to the imposition of currency controls and other government restrictions on repatriation in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the imposition of withholding and other taxes on such payments and our ability to repatriate earnings in a taxefficient manner 

in the event we are unable to generate or repatriate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate and our ability to finance our obligations including to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock could be adversely affected  

our quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly 

quarterly variations in revenues and operating results may occur due to several factors these include 

 a significant portion of our total operating expenses is relatively fixed in the short term therefore a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results for these businesses 

credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk 

currently the companys senior debt is rated a by sp and baa1 by moodys the ratings from both sp and moodys currently carry a stable outlook 

if we need to raise capital in the future for example in order to fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could limit our access to financing sources further a downgrade to a rating below investmentgrade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures 

global operations 

we are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations 

we do business worldwide in 2016 50 of the companys total revenue was generated from operations outside the united states and over onehalf of our employees were located outside the united states we expect to expand our nonus operations further 

the geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal economic operational market compliance and reputational risks these include among others risks relating to 



 our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

if we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event such as an earthquake hurricane flood terrorist attack pandemic security breach cyberattack power loss or telecommunications failure our ability to operate will depend in part on the continued availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we could experience operational challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business the risk of business disruption is more pronounced in certain geographic areas including major metropolitan centers like new york or london where we have concentrations of customers and employees or significant operations and in certain countries and regions in which we operate that are subject to potential threat of terrorist attacks or military conflicts 

our operations depend in particular upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage if a business continuity event occurs we could lose client or company data or experience interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients which could have a material adverse effect a cyberattack or other business continuity event affecting us or a key vendor or other third party could result in a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or operations requiring us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues an extended outage could result in the loss of clients and a decline in our revenues 

we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession however a disaster or other continuity event on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover from such an event could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships and legal liability our business disruption insurance may also not be sufficient in type or amount to cover the cost of a successful recovery in the event of such a disruption   

acquisitions and dispositions 

we face risks when we acquire and dispose of businesses 

we have a history of making acquisitions and investments including a total of 115 in the period 20112016 we expect that acquisitions will continue to be a key part of our business strategy our success in this regard will depend on our ability to identify and compete for appropriate acquisition candidates and to complete the transactions we decide to pursue with favorable results as we typically acquire other professional services firms the success of our transactions is also highly dependent on the retention of the key employees of our acquisition targets 

while we intend that our acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability we cannot be certain that our past or future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations acquisitions involve special risks including accounting regulatory compliance information technology or human resources issues that could arise in connection with or as a result of the acquisition of the acquired company the assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies 

difficulties in integrating acquired businesses possible management distraction and the inability of acquired businesses to achieve the levels of revenue profit productivity or synergies we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect on the timeline contemplated in addition if in the future the performance of our reporting units or an acquired business varies from our projections or assumptions or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units or an acquired business change the estimated fair value of our reporting units or an acquired business could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill and other acquisitionrelated intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet or in adjustments in contingent payment amounts as of december 31 2016 the companys consolidated balance sheet reflected 95 billion of goodwill and intangible assets representing approximately 52 of the companys total consolidated assets and allocated by reporting segment as follows risk and insurance services 68 billion and consulting 27 billion given the significant size of the companys goodwill and intangible assets an impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given period 

when we dispose of businesses we are also subject to the risk contractually agreed or otherwise that we will continue to be subject to the liabilities of that business after its disposition 

risks relating to our risk and insurance services segment 

our risk and insurance services segment conducted through marsh and guy carpenter represented 54 of the companys total revenue in 2016 our business in this segment is subject to particular risks 

results in our risk and insurance services segment may be adversely affected by a general decline in economic activity 

demand for many types of insurance and reinsurance generally rises or falls as economic growth expands or slows this dynamic affects the level of commissions and fees generated by marsh and guy carpenter to the extent our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions they may choose to limit their purchases of insurance and reinsurance coverage as applicable which would inhibit our ability to generate commission revenue and other revenue based on premiums placed by us also the insurance they seek to obtain through us may be impacted by changes in their assets property values sales or number of employees which may reduce our commission revenue and they may decide not to purchase our risk advisory or other services which would inhibit our ability to generate fee revenue moreover insolvencies and combinations associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies and combinations in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business as well as our revenues from insurers guy carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the market place 

volatility or declines in premiums and other market trends may significantly impede our ability to improve revenues and profitability 

a significant portion of our risk and insurance services revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to the normal cycles of pricing in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

as traditional insurance companies continue to rely on nonaffiliated brokers or agents to generate premium those insurance companies may seek to reduce their expenses by lowering their commission rates the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility or declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes it is difficult to accurately forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their risk 

protection needs this trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to selfinsure the use of captive insurers and the advent of capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance and reinsurance needs further the profitability of our risk and insurances services segment depends in part on our ability to be compensated for the analytical services and other advice that we provide if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for all of our services our margins and profitability could decline 

allegations of conflicts of interest adverse legal developments and future regulations concerning how intermediaries are compensated by insurers or clients could have a material adverse effect on marsh’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the ways in which insurance intermediaries are compensated receive scrutiny from regulators in part because of the potential for conflicts of interest the vast majority of the compensation that marsh receives is in the form of retail fees and commissions that are paid by the client or paid from premium that is paid by the client the amount of other compensation that we receive from insurance companies separate from retail fees and commissions has increased significantly in the last several years both organically and through acquisition this other compensation includes payment for i consulting and analytics services provided to insurers ii administrative and other services provided to insurers including services relating to the administration and management of quota shares panels and other facilities and iii contingent commissions paid by insurers based on volume and profitability of marshs placements future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these revenue streams in addition these revenues present potential regulatory litigation and reputational risks that may arise from alleged conflicts of interest or allegations under antitrust competition and unfair trade practice laws adverse regulatory legal or other developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and expose the company to negative publicity and reputational harm  

risks relating to our consulting segment 

our consulting segment conducted through mercer and oliver wyman group represented 46 of our total revenue in 2016 our businesses in this segment are subject to particular risks 

revenues for the services provided by our consulting segment may decline for various reasons including as a result of changes in economic conditions the value of equity debt and other asset markets our clients’ or an industrys financial condition or government regulation 

global economic conditions over the past several years have negatively affected businesses and financial institutions many of our clients including financial institutions corporations government entities and pension plans have been reducing expenses including amounts spent on consulting services and using internal resources instead of consultants the evolving needs and financial circumstances of our clients may reduce demand for our consulting services and our revenues and profitability if the economy or markets in which we operate experience continued weakness at current levels or deteriorate further our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition some segments of mercers investments business generate fees based upon the value of the clients’ assets under management or advisement changes in the value of equity debt currency real estate commodities or other asset classes could cause the value of assets under management or advisement and the fees received by mercer to decline such changes could also cause clients to withdraw funds from mercer’s investment business in favor of other investment service providers in either case our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected further revenue received by mercer as investment manager to the majority of the mercermanaged investment funds is reported in accordance with us gaap on a gross basis rather than a net basis therefore the reported revenue for these offerings does not fully reflect the inclusion of subadvisor fees and thus the amount of revenue ultimately attributable to mercer would be lower 

demand for many of mercers benefits services is affected by government regulation and tax laws rulings policies and interpretations which drive our clients needs for benefitsrelated services significant changes in government regulations affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of mercers services 

factors affecting defined benefit pension plans and the services we provide relating to those plans could adversely affect mercer 

mercer currently provides corporate multiemployer and public clients with actuarial consulting and administration services relating to defined benefit pension plans the nature of our work is complex our actuarial services involve numerous assumptions and estimates regarding future events including interest rates used to discount future liabilities estimated rates of return for a plans assets healthcare cost trends salary projections and participants life expectancies our consulting services involve the drafting and interpretation of trust deeds and other complex documentation governing pension plans our administration services include calculating benefits within complicated pension plan structures clients dissatisfied with our services have brought and may bring significant claims against us particularly in the united states and the united kingdom in addition a number of mercers clients have frozen or curtailed their defined benefit plans and have moved to defined contribution plans resulting in reduced revenue for mercers retirement business these developments could adversely affect mercers business and operating results 

mercer’s investment business is subject to a number of risks including risks related to thirdparty investment managers operational risk conflicts of interest asset performance and regulatory compliance that if realized could result in significant damage to our business 

mercer’s investment business provides clients with investment consulting and investment management referred to as delegated solutions services in the investment consulting business clients make and implement their own investment decisions based upon advice provided by mercer in its delegated solutions business mercer implements the client’s investment policy by engaging and overseeing independent asset managers who determine which securities to buy and sell to effect implementation of a client’s investment policy mercer may utilize its manager of managers investment funds 

mercer’s investment business is subject to a number of risks including risks related to thirdparties our operations conflicts of interest asset performance and regulatory compliance and scrutiny which could arise in connection with these offerings for example mercer’s due diligence on an asset manager may fail to uncover material deficiencies or fraud that could result in investment losses to a client there is a risk that mercer will fail to properly implement a client’s investment policy which could cause an incorrect or untimely allocation of client assets among asset managers or strategies mercer may also be perceived as recommending certain asset managers to clients or offering delegated solutions to an investment consulting client solely to enhance its own compensation asset classes may perform poorly or investment managers may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance negligence or other reasons resulting in poor returns or loss of client capital these risks if realized could result in significant liability and to damage our business in addition the fca is conducting a market study of the uk asset management industry which includes asset managers and investment consultants in november 2016 the fca published an interim report which contains preliminary findings relating to the investment consulting industry and a provisional reference to the uk competition  markets authority cma for a market investigation reference mir if the mir goes forward the cma may impose remedies on the industry that may adversely affect mercer’s uk investment consulting and delegated solutions businesses 

the profitability of our consulting segment may decline if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and pricing rates for our consultants 

the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on ensuring that our consultants maintain adequate utilization rates ie the percentage of our consultants working hours devoted to billable activities our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 



 if the utilization rate for our consulting professionals declines our profit margin and profitability could decline 

in addition the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on the prices we are able to charge for our services the prices we charge are affected by a number of factors including 

 if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for our services our profit margin and profitability could decline

operating expense 

consolidated operating expenses increased 1 in 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 on both a reported and underlying basis the underlying expense increase reflects higher base salary costs higher amortization of identified intangible assets and the impact of the net benefit from the termination of the companys post65 retiree medical reimbursement plan in the united states the rra plan which was recorded in the first quarter of 2015 partly offset by decreases in defined benefit plan pension expense and contingent acquisition consideration expense 

consolidated operating expenses decreased 2 in 2015 compared with the same period in 2014 but increased 3 on an underlying basis the increase in underlying expenses primarily reflects higher base salary bonus and higher defined benefit and defined contribution plan costs retirement benefit costs partly offset by the impact of the net benefit from the termination of the rra plan 

risk and insurance services

marsh and guy carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients or commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided the particular insurer or reinsurer the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiates with clients revenues can be affected by premium rate levels in the insurancereinsurance markets the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commissionbased compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insuredsreinsureds in many cases fee compensation may be negotiated in advance based on the type of risk coverage required and service provided by the company and ultimately the extent of the risk placed into the insurance market or retained by the client the trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next can be affected by changes in premium rate levels fluctuations in client risk retention and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured as well as new and lost business and the volume of business from new and existing clients 

marsh also receives other compensation from insurance companies separate from retail fees and commissions this compensation includes among other things payment for consulting and analytics services provided to insurers administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers including services relating to the administration and management of quota share panels and other facilities in which insurers participate and contingent commissions marsh and guy carpenter also receive interest income on certain funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others the investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities these regulations typically require segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates both of which vary from time to time for presentation purposes fiduciary interest is segregated from the other revenues of marsh and guy carpenter and separately presented within the segment as shown in the revenue by segments charts presented earlier in this mda

corporate expense in 2015 was 195 million compared with 204 million in 2014 the lower expenses in 2015 were primarily due to the cost of nonrecurring corporate initiatives which occurred in 2014 which included strengthening cyber security protections expenses related to strategic investments and corporate transformation efforts primarily within the hr and finance functions 



discontinued operations

summarized statements of income data for discontinued operations are as follows 



other corporate items 

interest 

interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to 5 million in 2016 compared with 13 million in 2015 the decrease is due to the combined effects of a lower level of invested funds and lower interest rates interest expense was 189 million in 2016 compared with 163 million in 2015 due to higher average debt outstanding during 2015 

interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to 13 million in 2015 compared with 21 million in 2014 primarily due to a   lower level of invested funds in 2015 interest expense was 163 million in 2015 compared with 165 million in 2014 due to lower average interest rates in 2015 compared with the prior year partly offset by higher average debt outstanding during 2015 

cost of extinguishment of debt 

in october 2014 the company redeemed 230 million of its 2015 notes and 400 million of its 2019 notes the company acquired the notes at market value plus a makewhole premium based on the terms of the original indenture which exceeded the carrying value of the notes and resulted in a cost of 137 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 

investment income 

the caption investment income loss in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments recognized in current earnings it includes when applicable otherthantemporary declines in the value of debt and availableforsale securities and equity method gains or losses on its investment in private equity funds the companys investments may include direct investments in insurance consulting and related companies and investments in private equity funds the company recorded net investment income of less than 1 million in 2016 and 38 million in 2015 net investment income in 2015 was primarily related to the general partner carried interest from trident iii stonepoint capital the investment manager of trident iii substantially liquidated the remaining two investments of trident iii during the third quarter of 2015 which resulted in the company recognizing its remaining deferred performance fees 

income taxes 

the companys consolidated effective tax rate was 276  291  and 285  in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively these rates reflect foreign operations which are taxed at rates below the us statutory tax rate including the effect of repatriation as well as the impact of discrete tax matters such as tax legislation changes in valuation allowances nontaxable adjustments to contingent acquisition consideration and the trueup of the tax provision to amounts filed in the companys tax returns in 2016 pretax income in the uk canada luxembourg australia bermuda and ireland accounted for approximately 60 of the companys total nonus pretax income with effective rates in those countries of 23 excluding certain discrete adjustments 27 2 30 1 and 13 respectively the company anticipates its nonus operations will continue to incur taxes at rates below the us federal tax rate of 35 under current us law the companys us revenue over the past three years has been approximately 50 of total revenue while over that period the pretax income from us locations has been approximately 25 of total pretax income 

as a usdomiciled parent holding company marsh  mclennan companies inc is the issuer of essentially all of the companys external indebtedness and incurs the related interest expense in the us further most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the us and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the united states 

the effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future it is sensitive to the geographic mix of and repatriation of the companys earnings which may result in higher or lower effective tax rates a proportional increase in us pretax income will tend to increase the effective tax rate because us federal and state corporate tax rates exceed tax rates applicable outside the us losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax assets the effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation 

the realization of deferred tax assets depends on generating future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable tax liabilities are determined and assessed 

jurisdictionally by legal entity or filing group certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings the company assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets the company considered all available evidence including the existence of a recent history of losses placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that the company believes is more likely than not to be realized 

changes in tax laws rulings policies or related legal and regulatory interpretations occur frequently and may also have significant favorable or adverse impacts on our effective tax rate for example political activity surrounding proposals for fundamental us tax reform have recently intensified and such reform if enacted could have a significant impact on the companys effective tax rate 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company is organized as a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries as the company does not have significant operations of its own the company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt obligations pay dividends to stockholders repurchase its shares and pay corporate expenses the company also provides financial support to its operating subsidiaries for acquisitions investments and certain parts of their business that require liquidity such as the capital markets business of guy carpenter other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows 

the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the united states funds from those operating subsidiaries are regularly repatriated to the united states out of annual earnings at december 31 2016 the company had approximately 850 million of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations substantially all of which is considered to be permanently invested in those operations to fund foreign investments and working capital needs the nonus cash and cash equivalents considered permanently reinvested includes 144 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements the company expects to continue its practice of repatriating foreign funds from its nonus operating subsidiaries out of current annual earnings while management does not foresee a need to repatriate the funds which are currently deemed permanently invested if facts or circumstances change management could elect to repatriate them if necessary which could result in higher effective tax rates in the future during 2016 the company recorded foreign currency translation adjustments which reduced net equity by 778 million continued strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies would further reduce the translated us dollar value of the company’s net investments in its nonus subsidiaries as well as the translated us dollar value of cash repatriations from those subsidiaries 

cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the company 

operating cash flows 

the company generated 20 billion of cash from operations in 2016 compared with 19 billion in 2015 these amounts reflect the net income of the company during those periods excluding gains or losses from investments adjusted for noncash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments of accrued liabilities or receipts of assets and pension contributions 

pensionrelated items 

contributions 

during 2016 the company contributed 27 million to its us pension plans and 187 million to nonus pension plans in 2015 the company contributed 29 million to us plans and 166 million to nonus plans 

in the united states contributions to the taxqualified defined benefit plans are based on erisa guidelines and the company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80 or more of the liability determined under the erisa guidelines there was no erisa funding requirement for the us qualified plan in 2016 the company expects to fund approximately 32 million to its us pension plans in 2017 including 6 million to its us qualified plan to meet erisa funding requirements 

the company contributed 91 million to the uk plans in 2016 including an expense allowance of approximately 9 million based on the funding test carried out at november 1 2016 the company contributions to the uk plans in 2017 are expected to be approximately 125 million including the expense allowance 

outside the united states the company has a large number of nonus defined benefit pension plans the largest of which are in the uk which comprise approximately 81 of nonus plan assets at december 31 2016 contribution rates for nonus plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements which may differ significantly from measurements under us gaap in the uk the assumptions used to determine pension contributions are the result of legallyprescribed negotiations between the company and the plans trustee that typically occurs every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans currently this results in a lower funded status than under us gaap and may result in contributions irrespective of the us gaap funded status in november 2016 the company and the trustee of the uk defined benefits plans agreed to a funding deficit recovery plan for the uk defined benefit pension plans the current agreement with the trustee sets out the annual deficit contributions which would be due based on the deficit at december 31 2015 the funding level is subject to reassessment in most cases on november 1 of each year if the funding level on november 1 is sufficient no deficit funding contributions will be required in the following year and the contribution amount will be deferred as part of a longterm strategy which depends on having greater influence over asset allocation and overall investment decisions in november 2016 the company renewed its agreement to support annual deficit contributions by the uk operating companies under certain circumstances up to gbp 450 million over a sevenyear period 

in the aggregate the company expects to contribute approximately 224 million to its nonus defined benefit plans in 2017 comprising approximately 99 million to plans outside of the uk and 125 million to the uk plans 

changes to pension plans 

effective september 1 2015 the company divided its us qualified defined benefit plan to provide enhanced flexibility to manage the risk associated with those participants not receiving benefit accruals the existing plan was amended to cover only the retirees currently receiving benefits and terminated vested participants as of august 1 2015 the companys active participants as of that date were transferred into a newly established legally separate qualified defined benefit plan the benefits offered to the plans participants were unchanged as a result of the plan amendment and establishment of the new plan the company remeasured the assets and liabilities of the two plans as required under us gaap based on assumptions and market conditions at the amendment date the net periodic pension expense recognized in 2015 reflects the weighted average costs of the december 31 2014 measurement and the september 1 2015 remeasurement 

the company continues to manage the cost and assess the competitiveness of its benefits programs and also to manage the risks related to its defined benefit pension plan liabilities in october 2016 the company modified its us defined benefit pension plans to discontinue further benefit accruals for participants after december 31 2016 at the same time the company amended its us defined contribution retirement plans for most of its us employees to add an automatic company contribution equal to 4 of eligible base pay beginning on january 1 2017 this new company contribution together with the company’s current matching contribution provides eligible us employees with the opportunity to receive a total contribution of up to 7 of eligible base pay as required under gaap the defined benefit plans that were significantly impacted by the modification were remeasured in october 2016 using market data and assumptions as of the modification date the net periodic pension expense recognized in 2016 reflects the weighted average costs of the december 31 2015 measurement and the october 2016 remeasurement in addition the us qualified plans were merged effective december 30 2016 since no participants would be receiving benefit accruals after december 2016 

after completion of a consultation period with affected colleagues in january 2014 the company amended its uk defined benefit pension plans to close those plans to future benefit accruals effective august 1 2014 and replaced those plans along with its existing defined contribution plans with a new comprehensive defined contribution arrangement this change resulted in a curtailment of the uk defined benefit plans and as required under gaap the company remeasured the defined benefit plans’ assets and liabilities at the amendment date based on assumptions and market conditions at that date the company recognized a curtailment gain of 65 million in the first quarter of 2014 primarily resulting from the recognition of the remaining unamortized prior service credit related to a plan amendment made 

in december 2012 this gain was mostly offset by the cost of a transition benefit to certain employees most impacted by the amendment 

effective august 1 2015 the company amended its ireland defined benefit pension plans to close those plans to future benefit accruals and replaced those plans with a defined contribution arrangement the company remeasured the assets and liabilities of the plans based on assumptions and market conditions on the amendment date 

changes in funded status and expense 

the yearoveryear change in the funded status of the companys pension plans is impacted by the difference between actual and assumed results particularly with regard to return on assets and changes in the discount rate as well as the amount of company contributions if any unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately 17 billion and 31 billion at december 31 2016 for the us plans and nonus plans respectively compared with 18 billion and 29 billion at december 31 2015 the decrease   in the us was primarily due to the modification of the us plans mentioned above the increase in the nonus plans was primarily due to the impact of decreases in the discount rates partly offset by actual returns on plan assets in 2016 that were higher than the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets in the past several years the amount of actuarial losses has been significantly impacted both positively and negatively by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities decreased in both the us and the uk the companys largest plans in 2016 after increasing in 2015 the increase in 2015 followed a decrease in 2014 an increase in the discount rate decreases the measured plan benefit obligation resulting in actuarial gains while a decrease in the discount rate increases the measured plan obligation resulting in actuarial losses during 2016 the companys defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 98 and 221 in the us and uk respectively during 2015 the companys defined benefit pension plan assets had a loss of 39 in the us and gain of 12 in the uk during 2014 the companys defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 98 and 194 in the us and uk respectively 

overall based on the measurement at december 31 2016 expenses related to the company’s defined benefit pension plans are expected to decrease in 2017 by approximately 120 million from 2016 this is driven by expense decreases in us plans resulting from the modification of those plans which discontinued further benefit accruals for participants after december 31 2016 as mentioned above this decrease will be partially offset by an increase in defined contribution expense due to the additional automatic company contribution also mentioned above the impact of the reduction in expense from the modification of the us plans offset by the additional expense from the additional company contributions to the defined contribution plan is expected to result in a net expense reduction of approximately 30 million net of bonus pension expenses in the company’s nonus defined benefit plans are expected to increase approximately 5 million from 2016 

historically service and interest costs were estimated using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curves used to measure the benefit obligations at the beginning of the period in 2016 the company changed the approach used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its significant nonus plans this change in approach was made to improve the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs the change did not impact the measurement of the plans’ total projected benefit obligation the company accounted for this change as a change in estimate that was applied prospectively beginning in 2016 and resulted in pension expense being approximately 45 million lower than if the prior approach had been used 

the company’s accounting policies for its defined benefit pension plans including the selection of and sensitivity to assumptions are discussed below under management’s discussion of critical accounting policies for additional information regarding the company’s retirement plans see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

in march 2015 the company amended the rra resulting in its termination with benefits to certain participants to be paid through december 31 2016 as a result of the termination of the rra plan the company recognized a net credit of approximately 125 million in the first quarter of 2015

management’s discussion of critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from those estimates 

legal and other loss contingencies 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions eo gaap requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance the company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel an internal actuarial analysis by oliver wyman group a subsidiary of the company and other analyses to estimate potential losses the liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable given the unpredictability of eo claims and of litigation that could flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the company’s businesses results of operations financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period 

in addition to the extent that insurance coverage is available significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the company’s various insurance programs 

retirement benefits 

the company maintains qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible us employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible nonus employees the company’s policy for funding its taxqualified defined benefit retirement 

plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable foreign laws 

the company recognizes the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci net of tax in the company’s consolidated balance sheets the gains and losses that exceed specified corridors are amortized prospectively out of aoci over a period that approximates the remaining life expectancy of participants in plans where substantially all participants are inactive or the average remaining service period of active participants for plans with active participants 

the determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate mortality and assumed rate of salary increase the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements the assumptions for expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate are discussed in more detail below 

the longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption is determined for each plan based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of the measurement date and the specific portfolio mix of each plan’s assets the company utilizes a model developed by mercer a subsidiary of the company to assist in the determination of this assumption the model takes into account several factors including actual and target portfolio allocation investment administrative and trading expenses incurred directly by the plan trust historical portfolio performance relevant forwardlooking economic analysis and expected returns variances and correlations for different asset classes these measures are used to determine probabilities using standard statistical techniques to calculate a range of expected returns on the portfolio 

the target asset allocation for the us plans is 64  equities and equity alternatives and 36  fixed income at the end of 2016 the actual allocation for the us plans was 65  equities and equity alternatives and 35  fixed income the target asset allocation for the uk plans which comprise approximately 81  of nonus plan assets is 48  equities and equity alternatives and 52  fixed income at the end of 2016 the actual allocation for the uk plans was 48  equities and equity alternatives and 52  fixed income 

the discount rate selected for each us plan is based on a model bond portfolio with coupons and redemptions that closely match the expected liability cash flows from the plan discount rates for nonus plans are based on appropriate bond indices adjusted for duration in the uk the plan duration is reflected using the mercer yield curve 

the table below shows the weighted average assumed rate of return and the discount rate at the december 31 2016 measurement date for measuring pension expense in 2017 for the total company the us and the rest of world row 



holding all other assumptions constant a halfpercentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the us and uk plans which together comprise approximately 86 of total pension plan liabilities as follows 



the impact of discount rate changes shown above relates to the increase or decrease in actuarial gains   or losses being amortized through net periodic pension cost as well as the increase or decrease in interest expense with all other facts and assumptions held constant it does not contemplate nor include potential future impacts a change in the interest rate environment and discount rates might cause such 

as the impact on the market value of the plans’ assets changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant also may not be representative of the impact on expense because the longterm rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost 

the company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees the cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the us is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire but is funded by the company as incurred the key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the companys tax rate reflects its income statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions the company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the evaluation of a tax position is a twostep process the first step involves recognition the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on only the technical merits of the position the technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes legislative intent regulations rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position if a tax position does not meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 

uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue 

certain items are included in the companys tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities which are measured at existing tax rates deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements in assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly the company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company also considers tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carryback of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law the underlying assumptions the company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the companys recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carryforwards are deductible or creditable valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction 

fair value determinations 

goodwill impairment testing—the company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred the company performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year in accordance with applicable accounting guidance the company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the company considered numerous factors which included that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin in its most recent estimate of reporting unit fair values whether significant acquisitions or dispositions occurred which might alter the fair value of its reporting units macroeconomic conditions and their potential impact on reporting unit fair values actual performance compared with budget and prior projections used in its estimation of reporting unit fair values industry and market conditions and the yearoveryear change in the company’s share price 

the company completed its qualitative assessment in the third quarter of 2016 and concluded that a twostep goodwill impairment test was not required in 2016 and that goodwill was not impaired 

sharebased payment 

the guidance for accounting for sharebased payments requires among other things that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values in addition management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards as defined by the accounting guidance 

as of december 31 2016 there was  144 million  of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards the weightedaverage period over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 142  years also as of december 31 2016 there was  1272 million  of unrecognized compensation cost related to the company’s restricted stock restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards the weightedaverage period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is approximately 105  years

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk and credit risk 

certain of the company’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets 

interest rate risk and credit risk 

interest income generated from the company’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates 

the company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates   



based on the above balances if shortterm interest rates increased or decreased by 10 or 6 basis points over the full year annual interest income including interest earned on fiduciary funds would increase or decrease by approximately 2 million 

in addition to interest rate risk our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counterparty credit risk to minimize this risk the company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a board approved investment policy the policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counterparty limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment the company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions the majority of cash and fiduciary fund investments are invested in shortterm bank deposits and liquid money market funds 

foreign currency risk 

the translated values of revenue and expense from the company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates the nonus based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 50 of total revenue we periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business although the company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location as such under normal circumstances the us dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the us dollar generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk however there have been periods where the impact was not mitigated due to external market factors and recent events including the vote on brexit in the united kingdom may result in greater foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future if foreign exchange rates of major currencies euro sterling australian dollar and canadian dollar moved 10 in the same direction against the us dollar compared with the foreign exchange rates in 2016  the company estimates net operating income would increase or decrease by approximately 54 million the company has exposure to approximately 80 foreign currencies overall in continental europe the largest amount of revenue from renewals for the risk  insurance services segment occurs in the first quarter 

equity price risk 

the company holds investments in both public and private companies as well as private equity funds investments of approximately 105 million are classified as available for sale which includes the companys investment in benefitfocus approximately 21 million are accounted for using the cost method and  389 million  are accounted for using the equity method which includes the companys 

investments in alexander forbes the investments are subject to risk of changes in market value which if determined to be other than temporary could result in realized impairment losses the company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements 

as of december 31 2016 the carrying value of the company’s investment in alexander forbes was  247 million  as of december 31 2016 the market value of the approximately 443 million  shares of alexander forbes owned by the company based on the december 31 2016 closing share price of 795  south african rand per share was approximately  251 million

regulation 

the companys activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under us federal and state laws as well as laws of other countries in which the companys subsidiaries operate 

see part i item 1a risk factors below for a discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our businesses 

risk and insurance services  while laws and regulations vary from location to location every state of the united states and most foreign jurisdictions require insurance market intermediaries and related service providers such as insurance brokers agents and consultants reinsurance brokers and managing general agents to hold an individual or company license from a government agency or selfregulatory organization some jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locallyowned business entities in those instances if the company has no licensed subsidiary it may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction such arrangements are subject to an internal review and approval process licensing of reinsurance intermediaries is generally less rigorous compared to that of insurance brokers and most jurisdictions require only corporate reinsurance intermediary licenses 

the insurance mediation directive was adopted by the united kingdom and 26 other european union member states in 2005 its implementation gave powers to the financial services authority fsa the united kingdom regulator at the time to expand their responsibilities in line with the financial services and markets act the result of which was the regulation of insurance and reinsurance intermediaries the enhanced regulatory regime effected a licensing system based on an assessment of factors which included professional competence financial capacity and the requirement to hold professional indemnity insurance in april 2013 the fsa was superseded by the financial conduct authority fca in april 2014 the fca’s responsibilities were expanded further to include the regulation of credit activities for consumers this included the broking of premium finance to consumers who wished to spread the cost of their insurance in april 2015 the fca obtained their concurrent competition powers enabling them to enforce the prohibitions on anticompetitive behavior in relation to financial services 

insurance authorities in the united states and certain other jurisdictions in which the companys subsidiaries do business including the fca in the united kingdom also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others these laws and regulations typically provide for segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them and generally apply to both the insurance and reinsurance business the fca is currently reviewing its rules drafted to protect client assets and client money if deemed appropriate the fca will implement changes intended to provide enhanced protection to client funds

fatca  regulations promulgated by the us treasury department pursuant to the foreign account tax compliance act and related legislation fatca require the company to take various measures relating to nonus funds transactions and accounts the regulations impose on mercer certain client financial account tracking and disclosure obligations with respect to nonus financial institution and insurance clients and require marsh and guy carpenter and mercer in limited circumstances to collect validate and maintain certain documentation from each foreign insurance entity that insures a risk that is subject to the regulations the company has adopted processes to substantially address fatca’s requirements barring us treasury action to scale back fatca in 2016 fatca’s application is due to expand as of january 1 2017 to regulate a broader set of insurance and reinsurance placements known as foreigntoforeign transactions though this expansion of fatca’s reach may be delayed or permanently suspended the company has begun to undertake measures to also achieve timely compliance with fatca’s foreigntoforeign requirements

 item 1a risk factors   

you should consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information presented in this report these risks have the potential to materially adversely affect the company  s business results of operations or financial condition 

risks relating to the company generally 

legal and regulatory issues 

we are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from errors and omissions breach of fiduciary duty and similar claims 

our operating companies provide numerous professional services including the placement of insurance and the provision of consulting investment advisory actuarial and other services to clients around the world as a result of these activities the company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of errors and omissions breach of fiduciary duty and similar claims which we refer to collectively as eo claims in our risk and insurance services segment such claims include allegations of damages arising from our failure to adequately place coverage or notify insurers of potential claims on behalf of clients in our consulting segment such claims include allegations of damages arising from the provision of consulting investments actuarial pension administration and other services these services frequently involve complex calculations and other analysis including i assumptions and estimates concerning contingent future events ii drafting and interpretation of complex documentation governing pension plans iii calculating benefits within complex pension structures and iv the provision of investment advice including regarding asset allocation and investment strategy and management of client assets including the selection of investment managers given the longtail nature of many of these types of claims these matters often relate to services provided by the company dating back many years such claims may subject us to significant liability for monetary damages including punitive and treble damages negative publicity and reputational harm and may divert personnel and management resources we may be unable to effectively limit our potential liability in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain types of claims particularly including those concerning claims of a breach of fiduciary duty  

in establishing liabilities for eo claims in accordance with fasb asc subtopic no 45020 contingencies  loss contingencies the company uses case level reviews by inside and outside counsel an internal actuarial analysis and other analysis to estimate potential losses a liability is established when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable the liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable nevertheless given the challenges inherent in establishing liabilities in accordance with fasb asc subtopic no 45020 as well as the unpredictability of eo claims and the litigation that can flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period 

further and as more fully described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item 8 of this report we are subject to legal proceedings regulatory investigations and other contingencies other than eo claims which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we cannot guarantee that we are or will be in compliance with all current and potentially applicable us federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states and its various states the european union and its member states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate for example we are subject to regulation by agencies such as the sec in the united states and the fca in the united kingdom state insurance regulators in the united states and selfregulatory organizations such as finra as further described above under part i item   1   business regulation of this report we are also subject to trade sanctions laws relating to countries such as cuba iran russia sudan and syria and anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010 we are subject to numerous other laws on matters as diverse as internal and disclosure controls and procedures securities regulation data privacy and protection taxation antitrust immigration wageandhour standards and employment and labor relations 

the us and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our operations are complex and our efforts to comply with these myriad laws and regulations require significant resources in some cases these laws and regulations may impose operational limitations on our business including on the products and services we may offer or on the rates we may charge for our products and services while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we our employees our consultants and our contractors and other agents are in full compliance with such laws and regulations or interpretations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws or regulations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations including those referred to above we may be subject to investigations criminal penalties or civil remedies including fines injunctions loss of an operating license or approval increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in a particular business or redress to clients the cost of compliance and the consequences of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition a failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company by exposing us to negative publicity and reputational damage or by harming our client or employee relationships 

in most jurisdictions government regulatory authorities have the power to interpret and amend applicable laws and regulations and have discretion to grant renew and revoke the various licenses and approvals we need to conduct our activities such authorities may require the company to incur substantial costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations in some areas of our businesses we act on the basis of our own or the industry  s interpretations of applicable laws or regulations which may conflict from state to state or country to country in the event those interpretations eventually prove different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities we may be penalized or precluded from carrying on our previous activities moreover the laws and regulations to which we are subject may conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate which increases the likelihood of our businesses being noncompliant in one or more jurisdictions 

we could incur significant liability or our reputation could be damaged if our information systems are breached or we otherwise fail to protect client or company data or information systems 

we rely on the efficient uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business and securely process transmit and store electronic information information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including cyberattacks computer viruses and other malware ransomware and other types of security breaches our systems are also subject to compromise from improper action by employees vendors and other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems we could experience significant harm if our information systems are breached or sensitive client or company data are compromised 

we are at risk of attack by a growing list of adversaries be it statesponsored organizations organized crime hackers or hactivists activist hackers through use of increasingly sophisticated methods of attack including longterm persistent attacks referred to as advanced persistent threats because the 

techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures resulting in potential data loss or other damage to information technology systems 

as the breadth and complexity of our infrastructure continues to grow including as a result of the use of mobile technologies cloud services social media and the increased reliance on devices connected to the internet known as the internet of things the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks also increases although encryption is growing in use as a means to protect data from theft we may not be able to encrypt the data across our diverse systems should an attacker gain access to our network using compromised credentials of an authorized user we are at risk that the attacker might successfully leverage that access to compromise additional systems and data certain measures that could increase the security of our infrastructure such as data encryption or deployment of multifactor authentication take significant time and resources to deploy broadly the inability to implement maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could have a material adverse effect on our business 

due to the large number of systems and platforms that we operate the increased frequency at which vendors issue security patches to their products and the need to test patches and in some cases coordinate with clients and vendors before they can be deployed we are at risk that we cannot deploy patches in a timely manner we are also dependent on third party vendors like cloud service providers to keep their systems patched in order to protect our data if we our clients and our vendors are unable to keep our systems patched in a timely manner our systems may be breached which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we have numerous vendors and other third parties who receive personal information from us in connection with the services we offer our clients a small percentage of them have direct access to our systems we are at risk of a cyberattack involving a vendor or other third party which could result in a breakdown of its data protection processes or the cyberattackers gaining access to our infrastructure through the third party to the extent that a vendor or third party suffers a cyberattack that compromises their operations we could incur significant costs and possible service interruption which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have a history of making acquisitions including 92 acquisitions in the period from 20092015 the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk for instance we may not adequately identify weaknesses in the target’s information systems either before or after the acquisition which could affect the value we are able to derive from the acquisition expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to a cyberattack we may also be unable to integrate the systems of the businesses we acquire into our environment in a timely manner which could further increase these risks until such integration takes place 

our policies procedures and technical safeguards may be insufficient to prevent or detect improper access to confidential personal or proprietary information by employees vendors or other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems improper access to or disclosure of sensitive client or company information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts as well as under existing or future laws rules and regulations resulting in increased legal and other costs and harm to our reputation and our business 

we have from time to time experienced data incidents and cybersecurity breaches such as malware incursions including computer viruses and ransomware users exceeding their data access authorization employee misconduct and incidents resulting from human error such as loss of portable and other data storage devices like many companies we are subject to regular phishing email campaigns directed at our employees that can result in malware infections and data losses although these incidents have resulted in data loss and other damages to date they have not had a material adverse effect on our business or operations in the future these types of incidents could result in confidential personal or proprietary information being lost or stolen including client employee or company data which could have a material adverse effect on our business we also may be unable to detect an incident assess its severity or impact or appropriately respond in a timely manner 

privacy laws are proliferating and changing frequently at times in a manner that creates conflicting demands we may not be in compliance with all applicable us federal and state or foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 

in providing services and solutions to clients we store sensitive client or company data including personal data in multiple jurisdictions we leverage systems and applications that are spread all over the world requiring us to regularly move data across national borders we expect these activities to increase in scope and complexity as a result we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect personal data such as the national laws implementing the european union’s data protection directive and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information these laws and regulations are frequently changing and are becoming increasingly complex and sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services for example the european union has just reached an agreement on a new general data protection regulation the gdpr that greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of its laws and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data such as privacy impact assessments data portability and the appointment of data protection officers in some cases other countries are passing data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time 

unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or company data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could subject us to significant litigation monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines and criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions under the gdpr certain violations may trigger a fine of up to 4 of a corporation’s global annual revenue such events could also result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation and cause us to lose clients and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations our liability insurance which includes cyber insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches cyberattacks and other related breaches 

financial risks 

our pension obligations could cause the company  s financial position earnings and cash flows to fluctuate 

the company has significant pension obligations to its current and former employees totaling approximately 148 billion and related plan assets of approximately 140 billion at december 31 2015 the company  s policy for funding its taxqualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth by us law and the laws of the nonus jurisdictions in which the company offers defined benefit plans in the united states contributions to the taxqualified defined benefit plans are based on erisa guidelines contribution rates for nonus plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements which may differ from measurements under us gaap in the united kingdom for example contributions to defined benefit pension plans are based on statutory requirements and are determined through a negotiation process between the company and the plans trustee this negotiation process is governed by uk pension regulations certain of the assumptions that result from the funding negotiations are different from those used for us gaap and currently result in a lower funded status than under us gaap 

during 2015 the company contributed 29 million to its us pension plans and 166 million to its nonus pension plans the calculations relating to our defined benefit pension plans are complex as indicated in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements pension plan assets and liabilities periodic pension expense and future funding amounts are affected by future asset performance the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities rates of inflation mortality assumptions and other variables given the magnitude of our worldwide pension plans variations in or reassessment of the preceding factors or potential miscalculations relating to our defined benefit pension plans could cause significant fluctuation from year to year in our earnings and cash flow as well as our pension plan assets liabilities and equity and may result in increased levels of contributions to our pension plans 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions and political events around the world and the effects of these conditions and events on our clients   businesses and levels of business activity 

macroeconomic conditions and political events around the world affect our clients   businesses and the markets they serve these conditions may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing for those services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations changes in macroeconomic and political conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have a competitive advantage and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain if the demand for our products and services declines as a result of macroeconomic conditions political events or other factors we may be required to restructure our business which could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy 

our investments including our minority investments in other companies as well as our cash investments and those held in a fiduciary capacity are subject to general credit liquidity counterparty market and interest rate risks these may be exacerbated by global macroeconomic conditions market volatility and regulatory financial and other difficulties affecting the companies in which we have invested or that may be faced by financial institution counterparties during times of stress in the banking industry counterparty risk can quickly escalate potentially resulting in substantial trading and investment losses for corporate and other investors in addition we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may continue to experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels if the banking system or the fixed income interest rate credit or equity markets deteriorate the value and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected 

our significant nonus operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business 

we are subject to exchange rate movement because some of our subsidiaries receive revenue other than in their functional currencies and because we must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in certain jurisdictions however our risk and insurance services operations generate revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in local currency due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we are subject to economic exposure as well as currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations because the nonus based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 51 of total revenue exchange rate movement can have a significant impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow for additional discussion see market risk and credit riskforeign currency risk in part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this report 

we may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

the company is organized as a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries because we do not have significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations paying dividends to stockholders repurchasing our common stock under our share repurchase program and paying corporate expenses in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and make other payments to the company we may not be able to service our debt pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock or meet our other obligations 

further the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the united states funds from current year’s earnings of the companys nonus operating subsidiaries are regularly repatriated to the united states a number of factors could arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or could make repatriation costprohibitive including but not limited to the imposition of currency controls and other government restrictions on repatriation in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the imposition of withholding and other taxes on such payments and our ability to repatriate earnings in a taxefficient manner 

in the event we are unable to generate or repatriate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate and our ability to finance our obligations including to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock could be adversely affected  

credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk 

currently the companys senior debt is rated a by sp and baa1 by moodys the ratings from both sp and moodys currently carry a stable outlook 

if we need to raise capital in the future for example in order to fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could limit our access to financing sources further we believe that a downgrade to a rating below investmentgrade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures 

our quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly 

quarterly variations in revenues and operating results may occur due to several factors these include 

 a significant portion of our total operating expenses is relatively fixed in the short term therefore a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results for these businesses 

if we are unable to collect our receivables our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for the work we perform accounts receivable typically total about onequarter of our total annual revenues in most cases we bill and collect on relatively short cycles there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions could result in financial difficulties for our clients which could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of or be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time it takes to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro could adversely affect the companys operating results as well as the value of the companys eurodenominated assets 

concerns persist regarding the ability of certain eurozone countries to service their debt obligations as a result a number of these countries have undertaken a variety of actions such as cutting spending and raising taxes designed to ease their future debt burdens a potential consequence may be stagnant growth or even recession in the eurozone economies and beyond any of these developments could lead to further contraction in the eurozone economies adversely affecting our operating results in the region the company may also face increased   credit risk as our clients and financial institution counterparties in the region find themselves with reduced resources to meet their obligations finally the value of the companys assets held in the eurozone including cash holdings will decline if the currency devalues 

global operations 

we are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations 

we do business worldwide in 2015 51 of the company  s total revenue was generated from operations outside the united states and over onehalf of our employees were located outside the united states we expect to expand our nonus operations further 

the geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal economic operational market compliance and reputational risks these include among others risks relating to 

 18 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake hurricane flood terrorist attack pandemic security breach cyber attack power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our ability to continue to operate will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we could experience operational challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our operations depend upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from events that could have a significant disruptive effect we could potentially lose client or company data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario in particular a cyberattack on us or a key vendor or supplier could result in a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or operations requiring us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues an extended service outage may result in the loss of clients and a decline in our revenues 

we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession however a disaster or other continuity event on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover from such an event could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships and legal liability 

competitive risks 

each of the company  s businesses operates in a highly competitive environment if we fail to compete effectively against our competitors some of which have lower effective tax rates our business results of operations and financial condition will be impacted adversely 

as a global professional services firm the company faces acute and continuous competition in each of its operating segments our ability to compete successfully depends on a variety of factors including the quality and expertise of our colleagues our geographic reach the sophistication and quality of our services our pricing relative to competitors our customers   ability to selfinsure or use internal resources instead of consultants and our ability to respond to changes in client demand and industry conditions some of our competitors may have greater financial resources or may be better positioned to respond to technological and other changes in the industries we serve and they may be able to compete more effectively if we are unable to respond successfully to the competition we face our business results of operations and financial condition will be adversely impacted 

in addition given the global breadth of our operations the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the united states funds from the company  s nonus operating subsidiaries are regularly repatriated to the united states out of annual earnings to pay dividends to stockholders fund share repurchases and for other corporate purposes the company  s consolidated tax rate is higher than a number of its key competitors that are domiciled outside the united states where corporate tax rates are lower than the us statutory tax rate the higher consolidated tax rate at which our earnings are taxed could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete with a number of our competitors 

in our risk and insurance services segment in addition to the challenges posed by capital market alternatives to traditional insurance and reinsurance we compete intensely against a wide range of other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a global regional national or local scale for both client business and employee talent we compete as well with insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or other market intermediaries and with various other companies that provide riskrelated services or alternatives to traditional brokerage services this competition is intensified by an industry trend toward a “ syndicated ”  or “ distributed ”  approach to the purchase of insurance and reinsurance brokerage services whereby a client engages multiple brokers to service different portions of the client  s account 

in our consulting segment we compete for business and employee talent with numerous consulting firms and organizations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms around the world through these affiliations such competitors may be able to offer more comprehensive products and services to potential clients which may give them a competitive advantage 

the loss of key professionals could hurt our ability to retain existing client revenues and generate revenues from new business 

across all of our businesses our colleagues are critical to developing and retaining the client relationships performing the service on which our revenues depend it is therefore important for us to retain significant revenueproducing employees and the key managerial and other professionals who support them we face numerous challenges in this regard including the intense competition for talent in all of our businesses and the general mobility of professionals in our businesses 

losing employees who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements which could adversely affect our results of operations and subject to applicable restrictive covenants if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 

our businesses face rapid technological changes and our failure to adequately anticipate or respond to these changes or to successfully implement strategic initiatives to address them could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

to remain competitive in many of our business areas we must anticipate and respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological change we must also identify relevant technologies and methodologies and integrate them into our product and service offerings we may not be able to do this effectively we have a number of strategic initiatives involving investments in technology systems and infrastructure to support our growth strategy in addition to new platforms and systems we are deploying new processes and many of our colleagues across the business are changing the way they perform certain roles to capture efficiencies in some cases we depend on key vendors and partners to provide technology and other support for our strategic initiatives if these vendors or partners fail to perform their obligations or otherwise cease to work with us our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected if we do not keep up with technological changes or execute well on our strategic initiatives our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

consolidation in the industries we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work any of these or similar possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business guy carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the marketplace 

acquisitions and dispositions 

we face risks when we acquire and dispose of businesses 

we have a history of making acquisitions including a total of 92 acquisitions in the period 20092015 for aggregate purchase consideration of 42 billion we expect that acquisitions will continue to be a key part of our business strategy our success in this regard will depend on our ability to identify and compete for appropriate acquisition candidates and to complete with favorable results the transactions we decide to pursue 

while we intend that our acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability we cannot be certain that our past or future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations acquisitions involve special risks including accounting regulatory compliance information technology or human resources issues that could arise in connection with or as a result of 

the acquisition of the acquired company the assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and the inability of acquired businesses to achieve the levels of revenue profit or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect in addition if in the future the performance of our reporting units or an acquired business varies from our projections or assumptions or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units or an acquired business change the estimated fair value of our reporting units or an acquired business could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill and other acquisitionrelated intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet or in adjustments in contingent payment amounts as of december   31 2015 the company  s consolidated balance sheet reflected 89 billion of goodwill and intangible assets representing approximately 49 of the company  s total consolidated assets and allocated by reporting segment as follows risk and insurance services 65 billion and consulting 24 billion given the significant size of the company  s goodwill and intangible assets an impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given period 

when we dispose of businesses we are subject to the risk contractually agreed or otherwise that we will continue to be subject to the liabilities of that business after its disposition for example as described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item   8 of this report we have retained certain contingent litigation liabilities relating to our disposition of kroll 

risks relating to our risk and insurance services segment 

our risk and insurance services segment conducted through marsh and guy carpenter represented 53 of the company  s total revenue in 2015 our business in this segment is subject to particular risks 

results in our risk and insurance services segment may be adversely affected by a general decline in economic activity 

demand for many types of insurance and reinsurance generally rises or falls as economic growth expands or slows this dynamic affects the level of commissions and fees generated by marsh and guy carpenter to the extent our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions they may choose to limit their purchases of insurance and reinsurance coverage as applicable which would inhibit our ability to generate commission revenue also the insurance they seek to obtain through us may be impacted by changes in their assets property values sales or number of employees which may reduce our commission revenue and they may decide not to purchase our risk advisory services which would inhibit our ability to generate fee revenue moreover insolvencies and combinations associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies and combinations in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business guy carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the market place 

allegations of conflicts of interest adverse legal developments and future regulations concerning compensation we receive from insurers could have a material adverse effect on marsh’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the method by which insurance intermediaries are compensated has received substantial scrutiny from regulators in the past because of the potential for conflicts of interest the potential for conflicts of interest arises when an intermediary is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar transactions the vast majority of the compensation that marsh receives is in the form of retail commissions and fees that are paid by the client or paid from premium that is paid by the client the amount of compensation that we receive from insurance companies separate from retail commissions and fees has increased significantly in the last several years both organically and through acquisition this compensation includes payment for among other things i consulting and analytics services provided to insurers and ii administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers including services relating to the administration and management of quota shares panels and other facilities in which insurers participate it also takes the form of contingent commission which is paid by insurers based on the attainment of specified goals relating to marshs placements particularly at marsh  mclennan agency and in parts of marshs international operations future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these revenue streams in addition these revenues present potential regulatory litigation and reputational risks that may arise from alleged conflicts of interest or 

allegations under antitrust competition and other laws adverse regulatory legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition expose us to negative publicity and reputational damage and harm our client insurer or other relationships 

volatility or declines in premiums and other market trends may significantly impede our ability to improve revenues and profitability 

a significant portion of our risk and insurance services revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to the general phenomenon of pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their riskprotection needs this trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to selfinsure the use of socalled captive insurers and the advent of capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance and reinsurance needs further the profitability of our risk and insurances services segment depends in part on our ability to be compensated not only for insurance and reinsurance transactions but also for the increasing analytical services and advice that we provide if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for all of our services our margins and profitability could decline 

risks relating to our consulting segment 

our consulting segment conducted through mercer and oliver wyman group represented 47 of our total revenue in 2015 our businesses in this segment are subject to particular risks 

revenues for our services may decline for various reasons including as a result of changes in economic conditions the value of equity debt and other asset markets our clients’ or an industrys financial condition or government regulation 

global economic conditions over the past several years have negatively affected businesses and financial institutions many of our clients including financial institutions corporations government entities and pension plans have been reducing expenses including amounts spent on consulting services the evolving needs and financial circumstances of our clients may reduce demand for our services and our revenues and profitability if the economy or markets in which we operate experience continued weakness at current levels or deteriorate further our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition some segments of mercers investments business generate fees based upon the value of the clients’ assets under management or advisement changes in the value of equity debt currency real estate commodities or other asset classes could cause the value of assets under management or advisement and the fees received by mercer to decline such changes could also cause clients to withdraw funds from mercer’s investment business in favor of other asset management strategies in either case our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

demand for many of mercers benefits services is affected by government regulation and tax rules which drive our clients needs for benefitsrelated services significant changes in government regulations affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of mercers services 

factors affecting defined benefit pension plans and the services we provide relating to those plans could adversely affect mercer 

mercer currently provides corporate multiemployer and public clients with actuarial consulting and administration services relating to defined benefit pension plans the nature of our work is complex our actuarial services involve numerous assumptions and estimates regarding future events including interest rates used to discount future liabilities estimated rates of return for a plans assets healthcare cost trends salary projections and participants life expectancies our consulting services involve the 

drafting and interpretation of trust deeds and other complex documentation governing pension plans our administration services include calculating benefits within complicated pension plan structures clients dissatisfied with our services have brought and may bring significant claims against us particularly in the united states and the united kingdom in addition a number of mercers clients have frozen or curtailed their defined benefit plans and have moved to defined contribution plans resulting in reduced revenue for mercers retirement business these developments could adversely affect mercers business and operating results 

mercer’s investment business is subject to a number of risks including risks related to thirdparty investment managers operational risk conflicts of interest asset performance and regulatory compliance that if realized could result in significant damage to our business 

mercer’s investment business provides clients with investment consulting and investment management referred to as delegated solutions services in the investment consulting business clients make and implement their own investment policy decisions based upon advice provided by mercer in its delegated solutions business mercer implements the client’s investment policy by engaging and overseeing independent investment managers who determine which securities to buy and sell typically through the client’s investment in mercers manager of managers funds 

mercer’s investment business is subject to a number of risks including risks related to thirdparties our operations conflicts of interest asset performance and regulatory compliance which could arise in connection with these offerings for example mercer’s due diligence on an investment manager may fail to uncover material deficiencies or fraud that could result in investment losses to a client there is a risk that mercer will fail to properly implement a client’s investment policy which could cause an incorrect or untimely allocation of client assets among investment managers or strategies mercer may also be perceived as recommending certain investment managers to clients or offering delegated solutions to an investment consulting client solely to enhance its own compensation asset classes may perform poorly or investment managers may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance negligence or other reasons resulting in poor returns or loss of client capital these risks if realized could result in significant liability and damage our business 

our profitability may decline if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and pricing rates for our consultants 

the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on ensuring that our consultants maintain adequate utilization rates ie the percentage of our consultants working hours devoted to billable activities our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 if the utilization rate for our consulting professionals declines our profit margin and profitability could decline 

in addition the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on the prices we are able to charge for our services the prices we charge are affected by a number of factors including 

 if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for our services our profit margin and profitability could decline

consolidated results of operations 

consolidated operating income increased 5 to 24 billion in 2015 compared with 23 billion in 2014 reflecting the combined impact of a slight decrease in revenue and a 2 decrease in expenses as compared to the prior year the company achieved this growth despite significant foreign exchange headwinds caused by the strengthened us dollar which had the effect of reducing the translated value of the company’s foreign earnings 

diluted net income per share from continuing operations was 298 compared to 261 last year reflecting a 160 million increase in net income as well as a 3 decrease in the average number of diluted shares outstanding as compared to the same period last year shares issued related to the vesting of share awards and exercise of employee stock options were more than offset by share repurchases over the past four quarters 

risk and insurance services operating income increased 30 million or 2 in 2015 compared with 2014 revenue decreased 1 but increased 3 on an underlying basis to 69 billion in 2015 reflecting underlying revenue growth of 3 at marsh and 2 at guy carpenter while expenses decreased 2 but increased 2 on an underlying basis 

consulting operating income increased 80 million or 8 to 11 billion in 2015 compared with 2014 reflecting flat revenue but an increase of 5 on an underlying basis expense decreased 1 but increased 4 on an underlying basis mercer and oliver wyman recorded underlying revenue growth of 4 and 7 respectively in 2015 as compared to 2014 the operating income and revenue in 2015 include a pretax gain of 37 million from the sale of mercers us defined contribution recordkeeping business

other corporate items

notes at market value plus a makewhole premium based on the terms of the original indenture which 

exceeded the carrying value of the notes and resulted in a cost of approximately 24 million in the fourth 

quarter of 2013 

investment income 

the caption investment income loss in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments recognized in current earnings it includes when applicable otherthantemporary declines in the value of debt and availableforsale securities and equity method gains or losses on its investment in private equity funds the companys investments may include direct investments in insurance or consulting companies and investments in private equity funds the company recorded net investment income of 38 million and 37 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively primarily related to the general partner carried interest from trident iii stonepoint capital the investment manager of trident iii harvested the remaining two investments of trident iii during the third quarter of 2015 which resulted in the company recognizing its remaining deferred performance fees 

income taxes 

the companys consolidated effective tax rate was 291  285  and 301  in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the tax rate in each year reflects foreign operations which are taxed at rates lower than the us statutory tax rate the lower effective tax rate attributed to the companys foreign operations primarily reflects lower corporate tax rates that prevail outside of the us net of the us tax impact from repatriating foreign earnings in 2015 pretax income in the uk canada australia germany bermuda and ireland accounted for approximately 60 of the companys total nonus pretax income with effective rates in those countries of 22 excluding the noncash deferred tax impact of uk tax 

legislation enacted in 2015 27 30 31 1 and 12 respectively under current us tax law the   company anticipates its nonus operations will continue to incur taxes at rates below the us federal tax rate of 35 the companys us revenue over the past three years has been approximately 46 of total revenue while over that period the pretax income from us locations varied from 15 to 30 of total pretax income 

as a usdomiciled parent holding company marsh  mclennan companies inc is the issuer of essentially all of the companys external indebtedness and incurs the related interest expense in the us further most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the us and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the united states 

the effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future it is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of the companys earnings which may result in higher or lower tax rates a proportional increase in us pretax income will tend to increase the effective tax rate because us federal and state corporate tax rates exceed tax rates applicable outside the us losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax assets the effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation 

the realization of deferred tax assets depends on generating future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable tax liabilities are determined and assessed jurisdictionally by legal entity or filing group certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings the company assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets and considered all available evidence including the existence of a recent history of losses placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that the company believes is more likely than not to be realized 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of its own the company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to meet its obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to stockholders for share repurchases and for corporate expenses we also provide financial support to our operating subsidiaries for acquisitions investments and certain parts of their business that require liquidity such as the capital markets raising business of guy carpenter other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows 

the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the united states funds from the company’s operating subsidiaries located outside of the united states are regularly repatriated to the united states out of annual earnings at december 31 2015 the company had approximately 800 million of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations substantially all of which is considered to be permanently invested in those operations to fund foreign investments and working capital needs at the current time the company does not intend to repatriate any of this cash the nonus cash and cash equivalents considered permanently reinvested includes 191 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements the company expects to continue its practice of repatriating foreign funds out of current annual earnings while management does not foresee a need to repatriate the funds which are currently deemed permanently invested if facts or circumstances change management could elect to repatriate them if necessary which could result in higher effective tax rates in the future during 2015 the company recorded foreign currency translation adjustments which reduced net equity by 643 million continued strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies would further reduce the translated us dollar value of the company’s net investments in its nonus subsidiaries as well as the translated us dollar value of cash repatriations from those subsidiaries 

cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the company 

operating cash flows 

the company generated 19 billion of cash from operations in 2015 compared with 21 billion in 2014 these amounts reflect the net income reported by the company during those periods excluding gains or losses from investments cost of extinguishment of debt and the disposition of businesses adjusted for noncash charges such as depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets 

pensionrelated items 

during 2015 the company contributed 29 million to its us pension plans and 166 million to nonus pension plans in 2014 the company contributed 25 million to us plans and 156 million to nonus plans 

in the us contributions to the taxqualified defined benefit plans are based on erisa guidelines and the company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80 or more of the liability determined under the erisa guidelines the pension stabilization provisions included in the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act enacted on july 6 2012 changed the methodology for determining the discount rate used for calculating plan liabilities under erisa which determines in part the funding requirements     after considering the impact of the pension funding stabilization provisions discussed above there was no erisa funding requirement for the us qualified plan in 2015 the company made a 02 million contribution to its taxqualified us pension plan in the first quarter of 2014 there currently is no erisa funding requirement for the us qualified plan for 2016 the company expects to fund approximately 26 million to its nonqualified us pension plans in 2016 

the company continues to manage the cost and assess the competitiveness of its benefits programs and also to manage the risks related to its defined benefit pension plan liabilities effective september 1 2015 the company divided its us qualified defined benefit plan the existing plan was amended to cover only the retirees currently receiving benefits and terminated vested participants as of august 1 2015 the companys active participants as of that date were transferred into a newly established legally separate qualified defined benefit plan the benefits provided to the plans’ participants were unchanged as a result of the plan amendment and establishment of the new plan the company remeasured the assets and liabilities of the two plans as required under us gaap based on assumptions and market conditions at the amendment date net periodic pension expense in 2015 includes the weighted average costs of the december 31 2014 measurement and the september 1 2015 remeasurement 

effective august 1 2015 the company amended its ireland defined benefit pension plans to close those plans to future benefit accruals and replaced those plans with a defined contribution arrangement the company remeasured the assets and liabilities of the plans based on assumptions and market conditions on the amendment date 

the company has a large number of nonus defined benefit pension plans the largest of which are in the uk which comprise approximately 83 of nonus plan assets contribution rates for nonus plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements which may differ significantly from measurements under us gaap in the uk contributions to defined benefit pension plans are determined through a negotiation process between the company and the plans trustee that typically occurs every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans this process is governed by uk pension regulations the assumptions that result from the funding negotiations are different from those used for us gaap and currently result in a lower funded status than under us gaap in march 2014 the company and the trustee of the uk defined benefits plans agreed to a funding deficit recovery plan for the uk defined benefit pension plans the current agreement with the trustee sets out the annual deficit contributions which would be due based on the deficit at december 31 2012 the funding level is subject to reassessment in most cases on november 1 st  of each year if the funding level on november 1 st  is sufficient no deficit funding contributions will be required in the following year and the contribution amount will be deferred as part of a longterm strategy which depends on 

having greater influence over asset allocation and overall investment decisions the company has agreed to support annual deficit contributions by the uk operating companies under certain circumstances up to gbp 450 million over a sevenyear period contingent guarantee agreement 

the company contributed 51 million to the uk plans in 2015 the uk employers also contribute an expense allowance each year of approximately 9 million based on the funding test carried out at november 1 2015 the company contributions to the uk plans in 2016 are expected to be approximately 100 million including the expense allowance 

in the aggregate the company expects to contribute approximately 191 million to its nonus defined benefit plans in 2016 comprising approximately 91 million to plans outside of the uk and 100 million to the uk plans 

funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the funded status of the plan 

after completion of a consultation period with affected colleagues in january 2014 the company amended its uk defined benefit pension plans to close those plans to future benefit accruals effective august 1 2014 and replaced those plans along with its existing defined contribution plans with a new comprehensive defined contribution arrangement this change resulted in a curtailment of the uk defined benefit plans and as required under gaap the company remeasured the defined benefit plans’ assets and liabilities at the amendment date based on assumptions and market conditions at that date the company recognized a curtailment gain of 65 million in the first quarter of 2014 primarily resulting from the recognition of the remaining unamortized prior service credit related to a plan amendment made in december 2012 this gain was mostly offset by the cost of a transition benefit to certain employees most impacted by the amendment 

the yearoveryear change in the funded status of the companys pension plans is impacted by the difference between actual and assumed results particularly with regard to return on assets and changes in the discount rate as well as the amount of company contributions if any unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately 18 billion and 29 billion at december 31 2015 for the us plans and nonus plans respectively compared with 17 billion and 32 billion at december 31 2014 the increase in the us was due to the increase in the discount rate partially offset by negative returns on plan assets the decrease in the nonus plans was primarily due to the impact of increases in the discount rates and actual returns on plan assets in 2015 that were lower than the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets in the past several years the amount of actuarial losses has been significantly impacted both positively and negatively by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities increased in both the us and the uk the companys largest plans in 2015 after decreasing in 2014 the discount rate increased in 2013 following decreases in each of the four years from 2009 to 2012 an increase in the discount rate decreases the measured plan benefit obligation resulting in actuarial gains while a decrease in the discount rate increases the measured plan obligation resulting in actuarial losses during 2015 the companys defined benefit pension plan assets had a loss of 39 in the us and gain of 12 in the uk during 2014 the companys defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 98 and 194 in the us and uk respectively and in 2013 actual returns of 126 and 86 in the us and uk respectively 

overall based on the measurement at december 31 2015 expenses related to the company’s defined benefit pension plans are expected to decrease in 2016 by approximately 165 million from the 2015 expenses of 82 million this is driven by expense decreases of approximately 80 million in us plans and 85 million in nonus plans the expense decrease in the us plans results primarily from an increase in the discount rates used to measure plan liabilities and costs and the impact of an increase in the length of the period over which actuarial gains and losses are amortized moving to average life expectancy for a us plan that has substantially all inactive members the decrease in the company’s nonus defined benefit plans is due to generally higher discount rates used to measure plan liabilities and costs the impact of the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses moving to average life expectancy for plans in ireland that were frozen and have substantially all inactive members and a change in how the company estimates the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs described in more detail below partly offset by lower estimated returns to be earned on plan assets 

historically service and interest costs were estimated using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curves used to measure the benefit obligations at the beginning of the period for 2016 the company has changed the approach used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its significant nonus plans this change in approach was made to improve the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs the change does not impact the measurement of the plans’ total projected benefit obligation the company has accounted for this change as a change in estimate that will be applied prospectively beginning in 2016 as a result of this change service and interest cost in 2016 are expected to be approximately 45 million lower than if the prior approach were used in 2016 this amount is included in the 85 million decrease for nonus plans described above

the above does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 74 million as the company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities other than approximately 3 million that may become payable during 2016 the above does not include the indemnified liabilities discussed in note 15 as the company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities the above does not include net pension liabilities of approximately 19 billion because the timing and amount of ultimate payment of such liability is dependent upon future events including but not limited to future returns on plan assets and changes in the discount rate used to measure the liabilities the amounts of estimated future benefits payments to be made from pension plan assets are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in 2016 the company expects to contribute approximately 26 million and 191 million to its us and nonus pension plans respectively 

management’s discussion of critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from those estimates 

legal and other loss contingencies 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions eo gaap requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance the company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel an internal actuarial analysis and other analyses to estimate potential losses the liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable given the unpredictability of eo claims and of litigation that could flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the company’s businesses results of operations financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period 

in addition to the extent that insurance coverage is available significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the company’s various insurance programs 

retirement benefits 

the company maintains qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible us employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible nonus employees the company’s policy for funding its taxqualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable foreign laws 

the company recognizes the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci net of tax in the company’s consolidated balance sheets the gains and losses that exceed specified corridors are amortized prospectively out of aoci over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees or for plans in which substantially all the participants are inactive over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive employees 

the determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate mortality and assumed rate of salary increase significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements the company believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate 

future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions future investment performance future assumptions and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans holding all other assumptions constant a halfpercentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the us and uk plans which together comprise approximately 86 of total pension plan liabilities as follows 



changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense because the longterm rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost 

the company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees the cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the us is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire but is funded by the company as incurred the key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the companys tax rate reflects its income statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions the company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the evaluation of a tax position is a twostep process the first step involves recognition the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on only the technical merits of the position the technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes legislative intent regulations rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 

uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue 

tax law requires items be included in the companys tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements in assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts 

the valuation allowance accordingly the company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company also considers tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carryback of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law the underlying assumptions the company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the companys recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carryforwards are deductible or creditable valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction 

fair value determinations 

goodwill impairment testing—the company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred the company performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year in accordance with applicable accounting guidance the company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the company considered numerous factors which included that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin in its most recent estimate of reporting unit fair values whether significant acquisitions or dispositions occurred which might alter the fair value of its reporting units macroeconomic conditions and their potential impact on reporting unit fair values actual performance compared with budget and prior projections used in its estimation of reporting unit fair values industry and market conditions and the yearoveryear change in the company’s share price 

the company completed its qualitative assessment in the third quarter of 2015 and concluded that a twostep goodwill impairment test was not required in 2015 and that goodwill was not impaired 

sharebased payment 

the guidance for accounting for sharebased payments requires among other things that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values in addition management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards as defined by the accounting guidance 

as of december 31 2015 there was 118 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards the weightedaverage period over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 116 years also as of december 31 2015 there was 945 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the company’s restricted stock restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards the weightedaverage period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is approximately 11 years

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk and credit risk 

certain of the company’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets 

interest rate risk and credit risk 

interest income generated from the company’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates 

the company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates   



based on the above balances if shortterm interest rates increased or decreased by 10 or 6 basis points over the course of the year annual interest income including interest earned on fiduciary funds would increase or decrease by approximately 2 million 

in addition to interest rate risk our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counterparty credit risk to minimize this risk the company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a board approved investment policy the policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counterparty limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment the company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions the majority of cash and fiduciary fund investments are invested in shortterm bank deposits and liquid money market funds 

foreign currency risk 

the translated values of revenue and expense from the company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates the nonus based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 51 of total revenue we periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business although the company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location as such under normal circumstances the us dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the us dollar generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk if foreign exchange rates of major currencies euro sterling australian dollar and canadian dollar moved 10 in the same direction against the us dollar compared with the foreign exchange rates in 2015 the company estimates net operating income would increase or decrease by approximately 50 million the company has exposure to approximately 80 foreign currencies overall starting at the end of 2014 and continuing through 2015 the us dollar strengthened significantly against most currencies which had a significant impact on net operating income in 2015 if exchange rates at january 31 2016 hold constant throughout 2016 the company estimates the yearoveryear impact from conversion of foreign currency earnings will reduce full year income by approximately 50 million in continental europe the largest amount of revenue from renewals for the risk  insurance segment occurs in the first quarter consequently a significant portion of the yearoveryear foreign exchange impact is expected to occur in the first quarter 

equity price risk 

the company holds investments in both public and private companies as well as private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies investments of approximately 20 million are classified as available for sale approximately 76 million are accounted for using the cost method which includes the companys investment in benefitfocus and 347 million are accounted for using the equity method which includes the companys investments in alexander forbes the investments are subject to risk of changes in market value which if determined to be other than temporary could result in realized impairment losses the company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements 

at december 31 2015 the carrying value of the companys investment in alexander forbes purchased at 750 south african rand per share was approximately 230 million the market value of the companys shares based on the closing share price of 578 rand per share was approximately 166 million during 2015 the share price of alexander forbes ranged from 1038 rand to 532 rand the trading price first dropped below mmcs purchase price at the end of november 2015 the company considered several factors related to its investment in alexander forbes including its financial position the near and longterm prospects of alexander forbes and the broader south african economy and capital markets the length of time and extent to which the market value was below cost and the company’s intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for anticipated recovery in market value as a result the company determined the investment was not impaired

regulation 

the companys activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under united states federal and state laws as well as laws of other countries in which the companys subsidiaries operate see part i item 1a “risk factors” below for a discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our businesses 

risk and insurance services  while laws and regulations vary from location to location every state of the united states and most foreign jurisdictions require insurance market intermediaries and related service providers such as insurance brokers agents and consultants reinsurance brokers and managing general agents to hold an individual andor company license from a governmental agency or selfregulatory organization some jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locallyowned business entities in those instances if the company has no licensed subsidiary it may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction such arrangements are subject to an internal review and approval process licensing of reinsurance intermediaries is generally less rigorous compared to that of insurance brokers and most jurisdictions require only corporate reinsurance intermediary licenses 

the insurance mediation directive was adopted by the united kingdom and 26 other european union member states in 2005 its implementation gave powers to the financial services authority fsa the united kingdom regulator at the time to expand their responsibilities in line with the financial services and markets act the result of which was the regulation of insurance and reinsurance intermediaries the enhanced regulatory regime effected a licensing system based on an assessment of factors which included professional competence financial capacity and the requirement to hold professional indemnity insurance in april 2013 the fsa was superseded by the financial conduct authority “fca” in april 2014 the fca’s responsibilities were expanded further to include the regulation of credit activities for consumers this included the broking of premium finance to consumers who wished to spread the cost of their insurance in april 2015 the fca will also obtain their concurrent competition powers enabling them to enforce the prohibitions on anticompetitive behavior in relation to financial services 

insurance authorities in the united states and certain other jurisdictions in which the companys subsidiaries do business including the fca in the united kingdom also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others these laws and regulations typically provide for segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them and generally apply to both the insurance and reinsurance business the fca rules which protect client assets and client money are currently being reviewed by the fca with changes intended to provide enhanced protection to client funds expected in the second quarter of 2015 

certain of the companys risk and insurance services activities are governed by other regulatory bodies such as investment securities and futures licensing authorities in the united states marsh and guy carpenter use the services of mmc securities corp a brokerdealer investment adviser and introducing broker registered in the us with the sec and the commodity futures trading commission cftc and a member of the financial industry regulatory authority finra the national futures association and the securities investor protection corporation sipc primarily in connection with investment bankingrelated services relating to insurancelinked and alternative risk financing transactions also in the united states marsh uses the services of nia securities llc a us registered brokerdealer and member of finra and sipc in the united kingdom marsh and guy carpenter utilize the expertise of mmc securities europe limited which is authorized and regulated by the fca to provide advice on securities and investments including mergers  acquisitions in the european union mmc securities corp mmc securities europe limited nia securities llc and marsh investment services limited are indirect whollyowned subsidiaries of marsh  mclennan companies inc 

in some jurisdictions insurancerelated taxes may be due either directly from clients or from the insurance broker in the latter case the broker customarily looks to the client for payment 

consulting  certain of mercers retirementrelated consulting and investment services are subject to pension law and financial regulation in many countries in addition the trustee services investment services including advice to persons institutions and other entities on the investment of pension assets 

and assumption of discretionary investment management responsibilities and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services provided by mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are also subject to investment and securities regulations in various jurisdictions including the sec the department of labor and the cftc in the united states the fca in the united kingdom the central bank of ireland and the australian prudential regulation authority and the australian securities and investments commission in the united states mercer provides investment services through mercer investment management inc and mercer investment consulting inc each a registered investment adviser mercer trust company a new hampshire chartered trust bank provides services for mercer’s benefits administration and investment management business in the united states the benefits insurance consulting and brokerage services provided by mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to the same licensing requirements and regulatory oversight as the insurance market intermediaries described above regarding our risk and insurance services businesses mercer uses the services of mmc securities corp with the provision of certain retirement and employee benefit services oliver wyman group uses the services of mmc securities corp in the united states and mmc securities europe limited in the european union primarily in connection with corporate finance advisory services 

competitive conditions 

the company faces strong competition in all of its businesses from providers of similar products and services including competition with regard to identifying and pursuing acquisition candidates the company also encounters strong competition throughout its businesses from both public corporations and private firms in attracting and retaining qualified employees in addition to the discussion below see “risks relating to the company generallycompetitive risks” in part i item 1a of this report 

risk and insurance services  the companys combined insurance and reinsurance services businesses are global in scope the principal bases upon which our insurance and reinsurance 

businesses compete include the complexity range quality and cost of the services and products offered to clients the company encounters strong competition from other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis from a large number of regional and local firms in the united states the european union and elsewhere from insurance and reinsurance companies that market distribute and service their insurance and reinsurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses including commercial and investment banks accounting firms consultants and web search engines that provide riskrelated services and products or alternatives to traditional brokerage services 

certain insureds and groups of insureds have established programs of self insurance including captive insurance companies as a supplement or alternative to thirdparty insurance thereby reducing in some cases their need for insurance placements certain insureds also obtain coverage directly from insurance providers there are also many other providers of managing general agency affinity programs and private client services including specialized firms insurance companies and other institutions 

consulting  the companys consulting and hr outsourcing businesses face strong competition from other privately and publicly held worldwide and national companies as well as regional and local firms these businesses compete generally on the basis of the range quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients competitors include independent consulting and outsourcing firms as well as consulting and outsourcing operations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms 

mercers investments business faces competition from many sources including multimanager services offered by other investment consulting firms and financial institutions in many cases clients have the option of handling the services provided by mercer and oliver wyman group internally without assistance from outside advisors

 item 1a risk factors   

you should consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information presented in this report these risks have the potential to materially adversely affect the company  s business results of operations or financial condition 

risks relating to the company generally 

legal and regulatory issues 

we are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from errors and omissions and similar claims 

our operating companies provide numerous professional services including the placement of insurance and the provision of consulting actuarial and other services to corporate and public clients around the world as a result of these activities the company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of errors and omissions breach of fiduciary duty and similar claims which we refer to collectively as eo claims in our risk and insurance services segment such claims include allegations of damages arising from our failure to adequately place coverage or notify insurers of potential claims on behalf of clients in our consulting segment such claims include allegations of damages arising from our actuarial consulting investments pension administration and other services which frequently involve 1 assumptions and estimates concerning contingent future events 2 drafting and interpretation of complex documentation governing pension plans 3 calculating benefits within complex pension structures and 4 the provision of investment advice and management of client assets given the longtail nature of professional liability claims these matters often relate to services provided by the company dating back many years such claims may seek damages including punitive and treble damages in amounts that could if awarded be significant and subject us to liability for monetary damages negative publicity and reputational harm and divert personnel and management resources the company has varying levels of thirdparty insurance coverage with policy limits and coverage terms varying significantly by policy year 

in establishing liabilities for eo claims in accordance with fasb asc subtopic no 45020 contingenciesloss contingencies the company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel an internal actuarial analysis and other analysis to estimate potential losses a liability is established when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable the liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable nevertheless given the unpredictability of eo claims and of litigation that could flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period 

further and as more fully described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item 8 of this report we are subject to legal proceedings regulatory investigations and other contingencies other than eo claims which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we cannot guarantee that we are or will be in compliance with all current and potentially applicable us federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states and its various states the european union and its member states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate for example we are subject to regulation by foreign and domestic governments regulatory agencies such as the sec in the united states and the fca in the united kingdom and selfregulatory organizations such as finra as further described above under part i item   1   business regulation of this report the foreign and us laws and regulations applicable to our operations are complex and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance limit or restrict the products or services we sell or subject our business to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings these laws and regulations include trade sanctions laws relating to countries such as cuba iran russia sudan and syria anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act 2010 and similar local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and the foreign account tax compliance provisions of the hiring incentives to restore employment act in the us as well as import and export restrictions as discussed in more detail below they also include laws and regulations related to data privacy and cyber security 

we are subject to additional federal state and other rules and regulations including those required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act compliance with the requirements of these laws and regulations among others may be costly and could adversely affect our business 

while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we our employees our consultants or our contractors are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws or regulations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations including those referred to above we may be subject to investigations criminal penalties or civil remedies including fines injunctions loss of an operating license or approval increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in a particular business or redress to clients the cost of compliance or the consequences of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition these matters could have a material adverse effect on the company by exposing us to negative publicity and reputational damage or by harming our client or employee relationships 

in most jurisdictions government regulatory authorities have the power to interpret or amend applicable laws and regulations and have discretion to grant renew and revoke various licenses and approvals we need to conduct our activities such authorities may require the company to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations in some areas of our businesses we act on the basis of our own or the industry  s interpretations of applicable laws or regulations which may conflict from state to state or country to country in the event those interpretations eventually prove different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities we might be penalized or precluded from carrying on our previous activities moreover the laws and regulations to which we are subject may conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate which could increase the likelihood of our businesses being noncompliant in one or more jurisdictions 

the method by which insurance intermediaries are compensated has received substantial scrutiny from regulators in the past because of the potential for conflicts of interest the potential for conflicts of interest arises when an intermediary is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar transactions the vast majority of the compensation that marsh receives is in the form of retail commissions and fees the amount of compensation that we receive from insurance companies separate from retail commissions and fees has increased significantly in the last several years this compensation includes among other things payment for consulting and analytics services provided to insurers administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers including services relating to the administration and management of quota shares panels and other facilities in which insurers participate and contingent commissions in parts of our operations future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these revenue streams in addition these revenues present potential regulatory litigation and reputational risks that may arise from alleged conflicts of interest or allegations under antitrust competition and other laws adverse regulatory legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition expose us to negative publicity and reputational damage and harm our client insurer or other relationships 

finally government involvement in the insurance or reinsurance markets could displace insurance or reinsurance currently available from the private market and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

improper disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary data whether due to human error misuse of information by employees or vendors or as a result of cyberattacks could result in regulatory scrutiny legal liability or reputational harm and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we maintain confidential personal and proprietary information relating to our company our employees our clients and their employees and other third parties this information includes personally identifiable information protected health information and financial information 

confidential personal and proprietary information is subject to the risk that it will be improperly disclosed or misused either as a result of human error or improper action by employees vendors or third parties 

including through a cyberattack the age of some of our technology as well as the expansion of and increased use of mobile devices online and cloudbased services and social media tools by employees clients and third parties and the speed at which information can be widely distributed all contribute to an increased risk of intentional or unintentional distribution or misuse of such information in addition across our global operations we have a significant number of thirdparty vendors who have direct access to our systems or receive a significant amount of confidential personal or proprietary information from us as a result we are also at risk of a data incident involving a vendor including due to the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes or a cyberattack on a vendor’s systems 

in many jurisdictions around the world we are increasingly subject to new or changing laws rules and regulations relating to the collection use transfer retention security and management of such information these laws impose among other things restrictions on crossborder transfers stringent operational requirements breach notification obligations and in some jurisdictions significant penalties for noncompliance these evolving laws and regulations impose significant technology and compliance costs on us our failure to adhere to legal or regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or damage to our reputation as well as the risks described elsewhere herein relating to our compliance systems and controls 

we have to date experienced data incidents involving confidential personal and proprietary information including breaches resulting from human error as well as employees or vendors misusing such information and unauthorized persons gaining access to our systems to date these incidents have not had a material adverse effect on our business or operations in the future however such incidents could disrupt our business damage our reputation and subject us to significant legal liability the costs associated with such incidents could be substantial and could exceed any coverage available under our insurance policies 

we engage in periodic testing and maintain policies procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential personal and proprietary information however our testing efforts may not discover all system deficiencies and we may not be able to fully remediate any discovered deficiencies in a timely manner similarly our policies procedures and technical safeguards may be insufficient to prevent improper access to or disclosure or misuse of confidential personal or proprietary information we also may be unable to detect an incident assess the severity or impact of an incident or appropriately respond to an incident in a timely manner 

significant costs are involved with maintaining safeguards for our technology infrastructure if we are unable to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade these safeguards including in connection with the integration of acquisitions we could incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems could become more vulnerable which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

improper access to or use or disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts as well as under existing or future laws rules and regulations resulting in increased legal and other costs harm to our reputation and disruption of our business 

financial risks 

our pension obligations could cause the company  s financial position earnings and cash flows to fluctuate 

the company has significant pension obligations to its current and former employees totaling approximately 159 billion and related plan assets of approximately 149 billion at december 31 2014 the company  s policy for funding its taxqualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth by us law and the laws of the nonus jurisdictions in which the company offers defined benefit plans in the us contributions to the taxqualified defined benefit plans are based on erisa guidelines contribution rates for nonus plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements which may differ from measurements under us gaap in the uk for example contributions to defined benefit pension plans are based on statutory requirements and are determined through a negotiation process between the company and the plans trustee that typically occurs every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans this negotiation process is governed by uk pension regulations certain of the 

assumptions that result from the funding negotiations are different from those used for us gaap and currently result in a lower funded status than under us gaap 

during 2014 the company contributed 25 million to its us pension plans and 156 million to its 

nonus pension plans the calculations relating to our defined benefit pension plans are complex as indicated in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements pension plan assets and liabilities periodic pension expense and future funding amounts are impacted by future asset performance the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities rates of inflation mortality assumptions and other variables given the magnitude of our worldwide pension plans variations in or reassessment of the preceding factors or potential miscalculations relating to our defined benefit pension plans could cause significant fluctuation from year to year in our earnings and cash flow as well as our pension plan assets liabilities and equity and may result in increased levels of contributions to our pension plans 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients   businesses and levels of business activity 

global economic and political conditions affect our clients   businesses and the markets they serve these economic conditions may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing of those services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain should it become necessary for us to restructure our business including reducing our work force as a result of market conditions or other factors that reduce the demand for our products and services our ability to execute our business strategy could be adversely affected 

our cash investments including those held in a fiduciary capacity are subject to general credit liquidity counterparty market and interest rate risks that may be exacerbated by the difficulties faced by financial institution counterparties if the banking system or the fixed income credit or equity markets deteriorate the value and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected 

our significant nonus operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business 

we are subject to exchange rate movement because some of our subsidiaries receive revenue other than in their functional currencies and because we must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in certain jurisdictions however our risk and insurance services operations generate revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in local currency due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we are subject to economic exposure as well as currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations because the nonus based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 55 of total revenue exchange rate movement could have a significant impact on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flow for additional discussion see market risk and credit risk–foreign currency risk in part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this report 

increased counterparty risk changes in interest rates and other market developments could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and adversely affect our financial results 

during times of stress in the banking industry counterparty risk can quickly escalate potentially resulting in substantial trading and investment losses for corporate and other investors in addition we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may continue to experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels 

we are a holding company and may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

the company is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to stockholders and for corporate 

expenses in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and make other payments to the company we may not be able to service our debt pay our obligations or pay dividends on our common stock 

further the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the us since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are paid from the us it is important to be able to access the cash generated by our operating subsidiaries outside the us funds from the companys operating subsidiaries outside the us are regularly repatriated to the us via stockholder distributions and intercompany financings a number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive including but not limited to foreign exchange rates and taxrelated costs 

in the event we are unable to generate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate 

credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk 

currently the companys senior debt is rated baa1 by moodys and a by sp the ratings from both moodys and sp currently carry a stable outlook 

if we need to raise capital in the future for example in order to fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could limit our access to financing sources further we believe that a downgrade to a rating below investmentgrade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures 

our quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly 

quarterly variations in revenues and operating results may occur due to several factors these include 

 a significant portion of our total operating expenses is relatively fixed in the short term therefore a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results for these businesses 

if we are unable to collect our receivables our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for our work performed accounts receivable typically total about onequarter of our total annual revenues in most cases we bill and collect on relatively short cycles there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions could result in financial difficulties for our clients which could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our 

contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of or be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time it takes to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro could adversely affect the companys operating results as well as the value of the companys eurodenominated assets 

concerns persist regarding the ability of certain eurozone countries to service their debt obligations as a result a number of these countries have undertaken a variety of actions such as cutting spending and raising taxes designed to ease their future debt burdens a potential consequence may be stagnant growth or even recession in the eurozone economies and beyond any of these developments could lead to further contraction in the eurozone economies adversely affecting our operating results in the region the company may also face increased   credit risk as our clients and financial institution counterparties in the region find themselves with reduced resources to meet their obligations finally the value of the companys assets held in the eurozone including cash holdings will decline if the currency devalues 

global operations 

we are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations 

we do business worldwide in 2014 55 of the company  s total revenue was generated from operations outside the united states and over onehalf of our employees are located outside the united states we expect to expand our nonus operations further 

the geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal economic operational market compliance and reputational risks these include among others risks relating to 

 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake hurricane flood terrorist attack pandemic security breach cyber attack power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our ability to continue to operate will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we could experience operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations such as key executive officers or personnel that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario 

we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession however a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability 

competitive risks 

each of the company  s businesses operates in a highly competitive environment if we fail to compete effectively against our competitors some of which have lower effective tax rates our business results of operations and financial condition will be impacted adversely 

as a global professional services firm the company faces acute and continuous competition in each of its operating segments our ability to compete successfully depends on a variety of factors including the quality and expertise of our colleagues our geographic reach the sophistication and quality of our services our pricing relative to competitors and our customers   ability to selfinsure or utilize internal resources instead of consultants if we are unable to respond successfully to the competition we face our business results of operations and financial condition will be adversely impacted 

in addition given the global breadth of our operations the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the united states funds from the company  s operating subsidiaries located outside the us are regularly repatriated to the united states out of annual earnings to pay dividends to stockholders fund share repurchases and for other corporate purposes the company  s consolidated tax rate is higher than a number of its key competitors that are domiciled outside the united states where corporate tax rates are lower than the us statutory tax rate the higher consolidated tax rate at which our earnings are taxed could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete with a number of our competitors 

in our risk and insurance services segment in addition to the challenges posed by capital market alternatives to traditional insurance and reinsurance we compete intensely against a wide range of other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a global regional national or local scale for both client business and employee talent we compete as well with insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or other market intermediaries and with various other companies that provide riskrelated services or alternatives to traditional brokerage services this competition is intensified by an industry trend toward a “ syndicated ”  or “ distributed ”  approach to the purchase of insurance and reinsurance brokerage services whereby a client engages multiple brokers to service different portions of the client  s account 

in our consulting segment we compete for business and employee talent with numerous consulting firms and organizations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms around the world through these affiliations such competitors may be able to offer more comprehensive coverage to potential clients 

the loss of key professionals could hurt our ability to retain existing client revenues and generate revenues from new business 

across all of our businesses our colleagues are critical to developing and retaining the client relationships performing the service on which our revenues depend it is therefore important for us to retain significant revenueproducing employees and the key managerial and other professionals who support them we face numerous challenges in this regard including the intense competition for talent in all of our businesses and the general mobility of professionals in our businesses 

losing employees who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements which could adversely affect our results of operations and subject to applicable restrictive covenants if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 

our businesses face rapid technological changes and our failure to adequately anticipate or respond to these changes or to successfully implement strategic initiatives to address them could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

to remain competitive in many of our business areas we must identify the most current technologies and methodologies and integrate them into our service offerings we also have a number of strategic initiatives involving investments in technology systems and infrastructure to support our growth strategy in addition to new platforms and systems we are deploying new processes and many of our colleagues across the business are changing the way they perform certain roles to capture efficiencies if we do not keep up with technological changes or execute well on our strategic initiatives our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

consolidation in the industries we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge 

or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work any of these or similar possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business guy carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the marketplace 

acquisitions and dispositions 

we face risks when we acquire and dispose of businesses 

we have a history of making acquisitions including a total of 71 acquisitions in the period 20092014 for aggregate purchase consideration of 30 billion we have also exited various businesses including the sale of kroll in 2010 we expect that acquisitions will continue to be a key part of our business strategy our success in this regard will depend on our ability to identify and compete for appropriate acquisition candidates and to complete with favorable results the transactions we decide to pursue 

while we intend that our acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability we cannot be certain that our past or future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations acquisitions involve special risks including accounting regulatory compliance information technology or human resources issues that could arise in connection with or as a result of the acquisition of the acquired company the assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and the inability of acquired businesses to achieve the levels of revenue profit or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect in addition if in the future the performance of our reporting units or an acquired business varies from our projections or assumptions or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units or an acquired business change the estimated fair value of our reporting units or an acquired business could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill and other acquisitionrelated intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet or in adjustments in contingent payment amounts as of december   31 2014 the 

company  s consolidated balance sheet reflected 79 billion of goodwill and intangible assets representing approximately 44 of the company  s total consolidated assets and allocated by reporting segment as follows risk and insurance services 56 billion and consulting 23 billion given the significant size of the company  s goodwill and intangible assets an impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given period 

when we dispose of businesses we are subject to the risk contractually agreed or otherwise of posttransaction liabilities for example as described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item   8 of this report we have retained certain contingent litigation liabilities relating to kroll 

risks relating to our risk and insurance services segment 

our risk and insurance services segment conducted through marsh and guy carpenter represented 54 of the company  s total revenue in 2014 our business in this segment is subject to particular risks 

results in our risk and insurance services segment may be adversely affected by a general decline in economic activity 

demand for many types of insurance and reinsurance generally rises or falls as economic growth expands or slows this dynamic affects the level of commissions and fees generated by marsh and guy carpenter to the extent our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions they may choose to limit their purchases of insurance and reinsurance coverage as applicable which would inhibit our ability to generate commission revenue also the insurance they seek to obtain through us may be impacted by changes in their assets property values sales or number of employees which may reduce our commission revenue and they may decide not to purchase our risk advisory services which would inhibit our ability to generate fee revenue moreover insolvencies and combinations associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies and combinations in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business guy carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the market place 

volatility or declines in premiums and other market trends may significantly impede our ability to improve revenues and profitability 

a significant portion of our risk and insurance services revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to the general phenomenon of pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their riskprotection needs this trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to “ selfinsure ”  the use of socalled “ captive ”  insurers and the advent of capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance and reinsurance needs further the profitability of our risk and insurances services segment depends in part on our ability to be compensated not only for insurance and reinsurance transactions but also for the increasing analytical services and advice that we provide if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for all of our services our margins and profitability could decline 

risks relating to our consulting segment 

our consulting segment conducted through mercer and oliver wyman group represented 46 of our total revenue in 2014 our businesses in this segment are subject to particular risks 

demand for our services might decrease for various reasons including a general economic downturn a decline in a client  s or an industry  s financial condition or changes in government regulation 

global economic conditions over the past several years have resulted in negative impacts on businesses and financial institutions many of our clients including financial institutions corporations governmental 

entities and pension plans have been reducing expenses including amounts spent on consulting services the evolving needs or financial circumstances of our clients may challenge our ability to increase revenues and profitability and may reduce demand for our services if the economy or markets in which we operate experience continued weakness at current levels or deteriorate further our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition demand for many of mercer  s benefits services is affected by government regulation and tax rules which drive our clients   needs for benefitsrelated services for example significant changes in government regulations affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of mercer  s services 

some segments of mercers investments business generate fees based upon the amount of client assets to which mercer provides services across multiple asset classes as such significant and negative movements in global markets may reduce revenue generated by assetbased fees 

factors impacting defined benefit pension plans and the services we provide relating to those plans could adversely affect mercer 

mercer currently provides corporate multiemployer and public clients with actuarial consulting and administration services relating to defined benefit pension plans the nature of our work is complex our actuarial services involve numerous assumptions and estimates regarding future events including interest rates used to discount future liabilities estimated rates of return for a plans assets healthcare cost trends salary projections and participants life expectancies our consulting services involve the drafting and interpretation of trust deeds and other complex documentation governing pension plans our administration services include calculating benefits within complicated pension plan structures clients dissatisfied with our services have brought and may bring significant claims against us particularly in the 

us and the uk in addition a number of mercers clients have frozen or curtailed their defined benefit plans and have moved to defined contribution plans resulting in reduced revenue for mercers retirement business these developments could adversely affect mercers business and operating results 

our profitability may decline if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and pricing rates for our consultants 

the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on ensuring that our consultants maintain adequate utilization rates ie the percentage of our consultants   working hours devoted to billable activities our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 if the utilization rate for our consulting professionals declines our profit margin and profitability could decline 

in addition the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on the prices we are able to charge for our services the prices we charge are affected by a number of factors including 

 21 

 if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for our services our profit margin and profitability could decline

income taxes 

the companys consolidated effective tax rate was 285 301 and 290 in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the tax rate in each year reflects foreign operations which are taxed at rates lower than the us statutory tax rate the lower effective tax rate attributed to the companys foreign operations primarily reflects lower corporate tax rates that prevail outside of the us net of the us tax impact from repatriating foreign earnings in 2014 pretax income in the uk canada australia germany and bermuda accounted for approximately 60 of the companys total nonus pretax income with effective rates in those countries of 21 26 29 28 and 1 respectively under current us tax law the company anticipates its nonus operations will continue to incur taxes at rates below the us federal tax rate of 35 the companys us revenue over the past three years has been approximately 45 of total revenue while over that period the pretax income from us locations varied from 15 to 23 of total pretax income 

as a usdomiciled parent holding company marsh  mclennan companies inc is the issuer of essentially all of the companys external indebtedness and incurs the related interest expense in the us further most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the us and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the united states 

the effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future it is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of the companys earnings which may result in higher or lower tax rates a proportional increase in us pretax income will tend to increase the effective tax rate because us federal and state corporate tax rates exceed tax rates applicable outside the us losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax assets the effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation 

the realization of deferred tax assets depends on generating future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable tax liabilities are determined and assessed jurisdictionally by legal entity or filing group certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings the company assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets and considered all available evidence including the existence of a recent history of losses placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that the company believes is more likely than not to be realized 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate for example proposals for fundamental us international tax reform if enacted could have a significant adverse impact on the effective tax rate 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of its own the company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to meet its obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to stockholders for share repurchases and for corporate expenses other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows 

the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the united states funds from the company’s operating subsidiaries located outside of the united states are regularly repatriated to the united states out of annual earnings at december 31 2014 the company had approximately 13 billion of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations substantially all of which is considered to be permanently invested in those operations to fund foreign investments and working capital needs at the current time the company does not intend to repatriate any of this cash the nonus cash and cash equivalents considered permanently reinvested includes 179 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements the company expects to continue its practice of repatriating foreign funds out of current annual earnings while management does not foresee a need to repatriate the funds which are currently deemed permanently invested if facts or circumstances change management could elect to repatriate them if necessary which could result in higher effective tax rates in the future during 2014 the company recorded foreign currency translation adjustments which reduced net equity by 515 million continued strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies would further reduce the translated us dollar value of the company’s net investments in its nonus subsidiaries as well as the translated us dollar value of cash repatriations from those subsidiaries 

cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the company 

operating cash flows 

the company generated 21 billion of cash from operations in 2014 compared with 13 billion in 2013 these amounts reflect the net income reported by the company during those periods excluding gains or losses from investments cost of extinguishment of debt and the disposition of businesses adjusted for noncash charges such as depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets approximately half of this increase is due to lower pension contributions in 2014 as compared to 2013 which is further discussed below 

pension related items 

during 2014 the company contributed 25 million to its us pension plans and 156 million to nonus pension plans in 2013 the company contributed 26 million to us plans and 620 million to nonus plans which included contributions of 250 million to prefund all of the 2014 and a substantial portion of the 2015 deficit funding contributions for the uk plans and a discretionary contribution of 70 million to the canadian plans 

in the us contributions to the taxqualified defined benefit plans are based on erisa guidelines and the company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80 or more of the liability determined under the erisa guidelines the pension stabilization provisions included in the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act enacted on july 6 2012 changed the methodology for determining the discount rate used for calculating plan liabilities under erisa which determines in part the funding requirements after considering the impact of the pension funding stabilization provisions discussed above the company made a 02 million contribution to its taxqualified us pension plan in the first quarter of 2014 there currently is no erisa funding requirement for the us qualified plan for 2015 the company expects to fund approximately 25 million to its nonqualified us pension plans in 2015 

the company has a large number of nonus defined benefit pension plans the largest of which are in the uk which comprise approximately 83 of nonus plan assets contribution rates for nonus plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements which may differ significantly from measurements under us gaap in the uk contributions to defined benefit pension plans are based on statutory requirements and are determined through a negotiation process between the company and the plans trustee that typically occurs every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans this negotiation process is governed by uk pension regulations the assumptions that result from the funding negotiations are different from those used for us gaap and currently result in a lower funded status than under us gaap in march 2014 the company and the trustee of the uk defined benefits plans agreed to a funding deficit recovery plan for the uk defined benefit pension plans the current agreement with the trustee sets out the annual deficit contributions which would be due based on the deficit at december 31 2012 the funding level is subject to reassessment in most cases on november 1 st  of each year if the funding level on november 1 st  has sufficiently improved no deficit funding contributions will be required in the following year and the contribution amount will be deferred as part of a longterm strategy which depends on having greater influence over asset allocation and overall investment decisions the company has agreed to support annual deficit contributions by the uk operating companies under certain circumstances up to gbp 450 million over a sevenyear period 

as a result of the significant improvement in funded status during 2013 which included the 250 million deficit prefunding contribution discussed above no additional deficit recovery contributions were required in 2014 based on the funding test carried out at november 1 2014 company contributions to the uk plans in 2015 are expected to be 54 million  the uk employers also contribute an expense allowance each year of approximately 9 million 

in the aggregate the company expects to contribute approximately 169 million to its nonus defined benefit plans in 2015 comprising approximately 106 million to plans outside of the uk and 63 million to the uk plans 

funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the funded status of the plan 

after completion of a consultation period with affected colleagues in january 2014 the company amended its uk defined benefit pension plans to close those plans to future benefit accruals effective august 1 2014 and replaced those plans along with its existing defined contribution plans with a new comprehensive defined contribution arrangement this change resulted in a curtailment of the uk defined benefit plans and as required under us gaap the company remeasured the defined benefit plans’ assets and liabilities at the amendment date based on assumptions and market conditions at that date as a result of the remeasurement the projected benefit obligation pbo increased by approximately 147 million and the funded status decreased by approximately 137 million the change in the pbo and in the funded status relates primarily to a decrease in the discount rate at the remeasurement date the net periodic benefit costs recognized in 2014 were based on a weighted average resulting from the december 31 2013 measurement and the january 2014 remeasurement the company recognized a curtailment gain of 65 million in the first quarter of 2014 primarily resulting from the recognition of the remaining unamortized prior service credit related to a plan amendment made in december 2012 this gain was largely offset by the cost of a transition benefit to certain employees most impacted by the amendment 

the yearoveryear change in the funded status of the companys pension plans is impacted by the variance between actual and assumed results particularly with regard to return on assets and changes in the discount rate as well as the amount of company contributions if any unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately 17 billion and 32 billion at december 31 2014 for the us plans and nonus plans respectively compared with 10 billion and 30 billion at december 31 2013 the increase is primarily due to the impact of decreases in the discount rates partly offset by actual returns on plan assets in 2014 that were higher than the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets in the past several years the amount of actuarial losses has been significantly impacted both positively and negatively by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities decreased in both the us and the uk the companys two largest plans in 2014 after increasing in 2013 for the first time in four years prior to 2013 the discount rate decreased in each of the four years from 2009 to 2012 at the end of 2009 the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 60 declining to 56 49 and 44 at the end of 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively in 2013 the weighted average discount rate increased to 48 and in 2014 it decreased to 38 an increase in the discount rate decreases the measured plan benefit obligation resulting in actuarial gains while a decrease in the discount rate increases the measured plan obligation resulting in actuarial losses during 2014 the companys defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 98 and 194 in the us and uk respectively during 2013 the companys defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 126 and 86 in the us and uk respectively and in 2012 the actual returns were 141 in the us and 98 in the uk in 2013 both the increase in the discount rate and actual asset returns that were higher than the assumed rates of return contributed to actuarial gains in 2012 actuarial losses resulting from declines in the discount rate were partly offset by actual asset returns which exceeded the assumed rate of return 

overall based on the measurement at december 31 2014 expenses related to the company’s defined benefit pension are expected to increase in 2015 by approximately 115 million this is being driven by an increase of approximately 80 million in us plans and by an increase of 35 million in nonus plans the increase in the expected pension expense results primarily from a decrease in the discount rates used to measure plan liabilities and lower pension expense in 2014 as a result of recording the curtailment gain in 2014 partly offset by the impact of an increase in plan assets at the end of 2014 resulting from investment returns 

the company’s accounting policies for its defined benefit pension plans including the selection of and sensitivity to assumptions are discussed below under management’s discussion of critical accounting policies for additional information regarding the company’s retirement plans see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements

management’s discussion of critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from those estimates 

legal and other loss contingencies 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions eo gaap requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance the company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel an internal actuarial analysis and other analyses to estimate potential losses the liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable given the unpredictability of eo claims and of litigation that could flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the company’s businesses results of operations financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period 

in addition to the extent that insurance coverage is available significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the company’s various insurance programs 

retirement benefits 

the company maintains qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible us employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible nonus employees the company’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable foreign laws 

the company recognizes the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” net of tax in the company’s consolidated balance sheets the gains and losses that exceed specified corridors are amortized prospectively out of aoci over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees or for plans in which substantially all the participants are inactive over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive employees 

the determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate mortality and assumed rate of salary increase significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements the company believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate 

future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions future investment performance future assumptions and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans holding all other assumptions constant a halfpercentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the us and uk plans which together comprise approximately 86 of total pension plan liabilities as follows 



changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense because the longterm rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost 

the company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees the cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the us is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire but is funded by the company as incurred the key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the companys tax rate reflects its income statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions the company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the evaluation of a tax position is a twostep process the first step involves recognition the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on only the technical merits of the position the technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes legislative intent regulations rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements the second step is measurement a tax position 

that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 

uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue 

tax law requires items be included in the companys tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements in assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly the company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company also considers tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carryback of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law the underlying assumptions the company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the companys recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carryforwards are deductible or creditable valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction 

fair value determinations 

goodwill impairment testing—the company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred the company performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year in accordance with applicable accounting guidance the company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the company considered numerous factors which included that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin in its most recent estimate of reporting unit fair values whether significant acquisitions or dispositions occurred which might alter the fair value of its reporting units macroeconomic conditions and their potential impact on reporting unit fair values actual performance compared with budget and prior projections used in its estimation of reporting unit fair values industry and market conditions and the yearover year change in the company’s share price 

the company completed its qualitative assessment in the third quarter of 2014 and concluded that a twostep goodwill impairment test was not required in 2014 and that goodwill was not impaired 

sharebased payment 

the guidance for accounting for sharebased payments requires among other things that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values in addition management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards as defined by the accounting guidance 

as of december 31 2014 there was 16 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards the weightedaverage periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 105 years also as of december 31 2014 there was 558 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the company’s restricted stock restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards the weightedaverage period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is approximately one year

in addition to interest rate risk our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counterparty credit risk to minimize this risk the company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a board approved investment policy the policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counterparty limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment the company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions the majority of cash and fiduciary fund investments are invested in shortterm bank deposits and liquid money market funds 

foreign currency risk 

the translated values of revenue and expense from the company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates the nonus based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 55 of total revenue we periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business although the company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location as such the us dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the us dollar generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk if foreign exchange rates of major currencies euro sterling australian dollar and canadian dollar moved 10 in the same direction against the us dollar compared with the foreign exchange rates in 2014 the company estimates net operating income would increase or decrease by approximately 54 million the company has exposure to approximately 80 foreign currencies overall in the fourth quarter of 2014 the us dollar strengthened significantly against most currencies if exchange rates at january 31 2015 hold constant throughout 2015 the company estimates the yearoveryear impact from conversion of foreign currency earnings would reduce full year income by approximately 125 million in continental europe the largest amount of revenue from renewals for the risk  insurance segment occurs in the first quarter consequently a significant portion of the yearoveryear foreign exchange impact would occur in the first quarter 

equity price risk 

the company holds investments in both public and private companies as well as private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies publicly traded investments of 18 million are classified as available for sale nonpublicly traded investments of 12 million are accounted for using the cost 

method and 388 million are accounted for using the equity method the investments are subject to risk of changes in market value which if determined to be other than temporary could result in realized impairment losses the company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements

regulation 

the companys activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under united states federal and state laws as well as laws of other countries in which the companys subsidiaries operate see part i item 1a “risk factors” below for a discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our businesses 

risk and insurance services  while laws and regulations vary from location to location every state of the united states and most foreign jurisdictions require insurance market intermediaries and related service providers such as insurance brokers agents and consultants reinsurance brokers managing general agents and third party administrators to hold an individual andor company license from a governmental agency or selfregulatory organization some jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locallyowned business entities in those instances if the company has no licensed subsidiary it may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction such arrangements are subject to an internal review and approval process licensing of reinsurance intermediary brokers is generally less rigorous as compared to insurance regulation and most jurisdictions require only corporate reinsurance intermediary licenses 

beginning in january 2005 all european union member states were required to implement the insurance mediation directive this directive aims to apply consistent minimum professional standards to insurance and reinsurance intermediaries including a licensing system based on an assessment of factors such as professional competence financial capacity and professional indemnity insurance the adoption by member states of the european union of regulations to comply with the directive has led our insurance intermediary operations in the european union to become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements in january 2005 as part of the implementation of the directive in the united kingdom the power and responsibilities of the financial services authority fsa were expanded to include regulation of insurance and reinsurance intermediaries in the united kingdom in april 2013 the fsa was superseded by the financial conduct authority “fca” in april 2014 the fca’s responsibilities will be further expanded to include the regulation of consumer credit activities such as offering financing for consumers to meet their premiums 

insurance authorities in the united states and certain other jurisdictions in which the companys subsidiaries do business including the fca in the united kingdom also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others these laws and regulations typically provide for segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them and generally apply to both the insurance and reinsurance business the rules in the united kingdom are currently being reviewed by the fca with changes intended to provide enhanced protection to customer funds expected in the first quarter of 2014 

certain of the companys risk and insurance services activities are governed by other regulatory bodies such as investment securities and futures licensing authorities in the united states marsh and guy carpenter use the services of mmc securities corp a brokerdealer investment adviser and introducing broker registered in the us with the sec and the commodity futures trading commission cftc and a member of the financial industry regulatory authority finra the national futures association and the securities investor protection corporation sipc primarily in connection with investment bankingrelated services relating to insurancelinked and alternative risk financing transactions also in the united states marsh uses the services of nia securities llc a us registered brokerdealer and member of finra and sipc in the united kingdom marsh and guy carpenter utilize the expertise of gc securities part of mmc securities europe limited which is authorized and regulated by the fca to provide advice on securities and investments including mergers  acquisitions in the european union mmc securities corp mmc securities europe limited nia securities llc and marsh investment services limited are indirect whollyowned subsidiaries of marsh  mclennan companies inc 

in some jurisdictions insurancerelated taxes may be due either directly from clients or from the insurance broker in the latter case the broker customarily looks to the client for payment

 item 1a risk factors   

you should consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information presented in this report these risks have the potential to materially adversely affect the company  s business results of operations or financial condition 

risks relating to the company generally 

legal and regulatory issues 

we are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from “ errors and omissions ”  claims 

our operating companies provide numerous professional services including the placement of insurance and the provision of consulting actuarial and other services for corporate and public clients around the world as a result of these activities the company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of errors and omissions or “ eo ”  claims in our risk and insurance services segment such claims include allegations of damages arising from our failure to adequately place coverage or notify insurers of potential claims on behalf of clients in our consulting segment such claims include allegations of damages arising from our actuarial consulting investments pension administration and other services which frequently involve 1 assumptions and estimates concerning contingent future events 2 drafting and interpretation of complex documentation governing pension plans 3 calculating benefits within complicated pension structures and 4 the provision of investment advice and management of client assets given the longtail nature of professional liability claims eo matters often relate to services provided by the company dating back many years eo claims may seek damages including punitive and treble damages in amounts that could if awarded be significant and subject us to liability for 

monetary damages negative publicity and reputational harm and divert personnel and management resources the company has varying levels of thirdparty insurance coverage with policy limits and coverage terms varying significantly by policy year 

in establishing liabilities for eo claims in accordance with fasb asc subtopic no   45020 contingencies  loss contingencies the company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel an internal actuarial analysis and other analysis to estimate potential losses a liability is established when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable the liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable nevertheless given the unpredictability of eo claims and of litigation that could flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the company  s business results of operations financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period 

further as more fully described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item   8 of this report we are subject to legal proceedings regulatory investigations and other contingencies other than eo claims which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we cannot guarantee that we are or will be in compliance with all current and potentially applicable us federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states and its various states the european union and its member states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate for example we are subject to regulation by foreign and domestic governments regulatory agencies such as the sec in the united states and the fca in the united kingdom and selfregulatory organizations such as finra as further described above under part i item   1   business regulation of this report the foreign and us laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations are complex and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance limit or restrict the products or services we sell or subject our business to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings these laws and regulations include trade sanctions laws relating to countries such as cuba iran sudan and syria anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act 2010 and similar local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials the foreign account tax compliance provisions of the hiring incentives to restore employment act in the us as well as import and export restrictions 

we are subject to additional federal state and other rules and regulations including those required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act compliance with the requirements of these laws and regulations among others may be costly and adversely affect our business 

while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we our employees our consultants or our contractors are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws or regulations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations including those referred to above we may be subject to investigations criminal sanctions or civil remedies including fines injunctions loss of an operating license or approval increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in a particular business or redress to clients the cost of compliance or the consequences of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition these matters could have a material adverse effect on the company by exposing us to negative publicity and reputational damage or by harming our client or employee relationships 

in most jurisdictions government regulatory authorities have the power to interpret or amend applicable laws and regulations and have discretion to grant renew and revoke various licenses and approvals we need to conduct our activities such authorities may require the company to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations in some areas of our businesses we act on the basis of our own or the industry  s interpretations of applicable laws or regulations which may conflict from 

state to state or country to country in the event those interpretations eventually prove different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities we might be penalized or precluded from carrying on our previous activities moreover the laws and regulations to which we are subject may conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate which could increase the likelihood of our businesses being noncompliant in one or more jurisdictions 

the method by which insurance intermediaries are compensated has received substantial scrutiny from regulators in the past because of the potential for conflicts of interest the potential for conflicts of interest arises when an intermediary is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar transactions the vast majority of the compensation that marsh receives is in the form of retail commissions and fees the amount of compensation that we receive from insurance companies separate from retail commissions and fees has increased substantially in the last several years this compensation includes among other things payment for consulting and analytics services provided to insurers administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers including services relating to the administration and management of quota shares panels and other facilities in which insurers participate and contingent commissions in parts of our operations future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these revenue streams in addition these revenues present potential regulatory litigation and reputational risks that may arise from alleged conflicts of interest or allegations under antitrust competition and other laws adverse regulatory legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition expose us to negative publicity and reputational damage and harm our client insurer or other relationships 

finally government involvement in the insurance or reinsurance markets could displace insurance or reinsurance currently available from the private market and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

improper disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary data whether due to human error misuse of information by employees or vendors or as a result of cyberattacks could result in regulatory scrutiny legal liability or reputational harm and could have an adverse effect on our business or operations 

we maintain confidential personal and proprietary information relating to our company our employees and our clients this information includes personally identifiable information protected health information and financial information in many jurisdictions particularly in the us and the european union we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of this information these laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates as well as to transactions we enter into with thirdparty vendors 

data privacy is subject to frequently changing laws rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate there is a growing body of international data protection laws which in part includes security breach notification obligations more stringent operational requirements and significant penalties for noncompliance in addition legislators in the us are proposing new and more robust cybersecurity legislation in light of the recent broadbased cyberattacks at a number of companies these and similar initiatives around the world would add to our it and compliance costs our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing legal or regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or damage to our reputation in the marketplace as well as the general risks described herein relating to our compliance systems and controls 

we maintain policies procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential personal and proprietary information nonetheless we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or inadequate safeguards against employee or vendor malfeasance or cyberattacks that could result in improper access to or misuse of confidential personal or proprietary information in addition significant costs are involved with maintaining system safeguards for our technology infrastructure if we are unable to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards including in connection with the integration of acquisitions we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access 

with respect to our commercial arrangements with thirdparty vendors we have processes designed to require thirdparty it outsourcing offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage protection and transfer of confidential personal and proprietary information however we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional noncompliance by a vendor’s employee or agent the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes or a cyberattack on a vendor’s information systems 

we have experienced data incidents including breaches resulting from human error as well as attempts at unauthorized access to our systems which to date have not had a material impact on our business or operations in the future the cost associated with human error the misuse of information by employees or vendors or a major cyberattack related to our systems including costs relating to notification of data security breaches and costs of credit monitoring services could be substantial furthermore the use of mobile technologies and social media by employees and third parties and the speed at which information can be widely distributed increases the risks associated with the intentional or unintentional distribution of confidential personal or proprietary information improper access to or disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts as well as laws and regulations resulting in increased legal and other costs disruption of our operations and loss of revenue 

financial risks 

our pension obligations may cause the company  s earnings and cash flows to fluctuate 

the company has significant pension obligations to its current and former employees totaling approximately 135 billion and related plan assets of approximately 136 billion at december 31 2013 the company  s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth by us law and the laws of the nonus jurisdictions in which the company offers defined benefit plans in the us contributions to the taxqualified defined benefit plans are based on erisa guidelines contribution rates for nonus plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements which may differ from measurements under us gaap in the uk for example contributions to defined benefit pension plans are determined through a negotiation process between the company and the plans trustee that typically occurs every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans   this process is governed by uk pension regulations the assumptions that result from the funding negotiations are different from those used for us gaap and currently result in a lower funded status than under us gaap 

during 2013 the company contributed 26 million to its us pension plans and 620 million to nonus pension plans as more fully described in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements funding amounts will be impacted by future asset performance the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities rates of inflation mortality assumptions and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in accordance with asc topic no 715 the company reflects the over or underfunded amount of its pension plans as assets or liabilities respectively given the magnitude of our worldwide pension plans variations in any of the preceding factors could cause significant fluctuation in our earnings as well as our equity from year to year and may result in increased levels of contributions to our pension plans particularly in the uk 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients   businesses and levels of business activity 

global economic and political conditions affect our clients   businesses and the markets they serve these economic conditions may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing of those services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain should it become necessary for us to restructure our business including reducing our work force as a result of market conditions or other factors that reduce the demand for our products and services our ability to execute our business strategy could be adversely affected 

financial institution failures may cause us to incur increased expenses or make it more difficult either to utilize our existing debt capacity or otherwise obtain financing for our operations and investing activities including the financing of any future acquisitions 

our cash investments including those held in a fiduciary capacity are subject to general credit liquidity counterparty market and interest rate risks that may be exacerbated by the difficulties faced by financial institution counterparties if the banking system or the fixed income credit or equity markets deteriorate the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected 

our significant nonus operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business 

we are subject to exchange rate risk because some of our subsidiaries receive revenue other than in their functional currencies and because we must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in certain jurisdictions however our risk and insurance services operations generate revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in local currency due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we are subject to economic exposure as well as currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations exchange rate risk could have a significant impact on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

increased counterparty risk and changes in interest rates could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and adversely affect our financial results 

during times of stress in the banking industry counterparty risk can quickly escalate potentially resulting in substantial trading and investment losses for corporate and other investors in addition we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may continue to experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

the company is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to stockholders and for corporate expenses in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and other payments to the company we may not be able to service our debt pay our obligations or pay dividends on our common stock 

further the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the us since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are paid from the us it is important to be able to access the cash generated by our operating subsidiaries outside the us 

funds from the companys operating subsidiaries outside the us are regularly repatriated to the us via stockholder distributions and intercompany financings a number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive including but not limited to foreign exchange rates and taxrelated costs 

in the event we are unable to generate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate 

credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk 

currently the companys senior debt is rated baa2 by moodys and a by sp the rating from sp carries a stable outlook while the rating from moody ’ s carries a positive outlook 

if we need to raise capital in the future for example in order to fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could limit our access to financing sources further we believe that a downgrade to a rating below investment 

grade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures 

our quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly 

quarterly variations in revenues and operating results may occur due to several factors these include 

 a significant portion of our total operating expenses is relatively fixed in the short term therefore a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results for these businesses 

if we are unable to collect our receivables our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for our work performed accounts receivable typically total about onequarter of our total annual revenues in most cases we bill and collect on relatively short cycles there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions could result in financial difficulties for our clients which could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of or be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time it takes to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

concerns regarding the european debt crisis and market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro could adversely affect the companys operating results as well as the value of the companys eurodenominated assets 

concerns persist regarding the ability of certain eurozone countries to service their debt obligations as a result a number of these countries have undertaken a variety of actions such as cutting spending and raising taxes designed to ease their future debt burdens a potential consequence may be stagnant growth or even recession in the eurozone economies and beyond any of these developments could lead to further contraction in the eurozone economies adversely affecting our operating results in the region the company may also face increased   credit risk as our clients and financial institution counterparties in the region find themselves with reduced resources to meet their obligations finally the value of the companys assets held in the eurozone including cash holdings will decline if the currency devalues 

global operations 

we are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations 

we do business worldwide in 2013 55 of the company  s total revenue was generated from operations outside the united states and over onehalf of our employees are located outside the united states we expect to expand our nonus operations further 

the geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal economic operational market compliance and reputational risks these include among others risks relating to 

 our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake hurricane flood terrorist attack pandemic security breach cyber attack power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems would provide us with an important advantage nevertheless we could still experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations such as key executive officers or personnel 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario 

we regularly assess and take steps to improve upon our existing business continuity plans and key management succession however a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability 

competitive risks 

each of the company  s businesses operates in a highly competitive environment if we fail to compete effectively our business and results of operations will suffer 

as a global professional services firm the company faces acute and continuous competition in each of its operating segments our ability to compete successfully depends on a variety of factors including our geographic reach the sophistication and quality of our services our pricing relative to competitors and our customers   option to selfinsure or utilize internal resources instead of consultants if we are unable to respond successfully to the competition we face our business results of operations and financial condition will suffer 

in addition given the global breadth of the company  s operations the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the united states funds from the company  s operating subsidiaries located outside the us are regularly repatriated to the united states out of annual earnings to pay dividends to stockholders fund share repurchases and for other corporate purposes the company  s consolidated tax rate is higher than a number of its key competitors that are domiciled outside the united states where corporate tax rates are lower than the us statutory tax rate the consolidated tax rate at which our earnings are taxed could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete with a number of our peers 

in our risk and insurance services segment in addition to the challenges posed by capital market alternatives to traditional insurance and reinsurance we compete intensely against a wide range of other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a global regional national or local scale for both client business and employee talent we compete as well with insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or other market intermediaries and with various other companies that provide riskrelated services this competition is intensified by an industry trend toward a “ syndicated ”  or “ distributed ”  approach to the purchase of insurance and reinsurance brokerage services whereby a client engages multiple brokers to service different portions of the client  s account 

in our consulting segment we compete for business and employee talent with numerous consulting firms and organizations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms around the world through these affiliations such competitors may be able to offer more comprehensive coverage to potential clients 

the loss of key professionals could hurt our ability to retain existing client revenues and generate revenues from new business 

across all of our businesses our colleagues are critical to developing and retaining the client relationships on which our revenues depend it is therefore very important for us to retain significant revenueproducing employees and the key managerial and other professionals who support them we face numerous challenges in this regard including the intense competition for talent in all of our businesses and the general mobility of professionals in our businesses 

losing employees who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements which would adversely affect our results of operations in addition if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 

our businesses face rapid technological changes and our failure to adequately anticipate or respond to these changes or to successfully implement strategic initiatives could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

to remain competitive in many of our business areas we must identify the most current technologies and methodologies and integrate them into our service offerings we also have a number of strategic initiatives involving investments in technology systems and infrastructure to support our growth strategy in addition to new platforms and systems we are deploying new processes and many of our colleagues across the business are changing the way they perform certain roles to capture efficiencies if we do not keep up with technological changes or execute well on our strategic initiatives our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

consolidation in the industries we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge 

or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work any of these or similar possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business guy carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the marketplace 

acquisitions and dispositions 

we face risks when we acquire and dispose of businesses 

we have a history of making acquisitions including a total of 49 acquisitions in the period 20092013 for aggregate purchase consideration of 19 billion we have also exited various businesses including the sale of kroll in 2010 we expect that acquisitions will continue to be a key part of our business strategy our success in this regard will depend on our ability to identify and compete for appropriate acquisition candidates and to complete with favorable results the transactions we decide to pursue 

while we intend that our acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability we cannot be certain that our past or future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations acquisitions involve special risks including accounting regulatory compliance information technology or human resources issues that could arise in connection with or as a result of the acquisition of the acquired company the assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue profit or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect in addition if in the future the performance of our reporting units or an acquired business varies from our projections or assumptions or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units or an acquired business change the estimated fair value of our reporting units or an acquired business could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill and other acquisitionrelated intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet or in adjustments in contingent payment amounts as of december   31 2013 the company  s consolidated balance sheet reflected 74 billion of goodwill and intangible assets representing approximately 44 of the company  s total consolidated assets and allocated by reporting segment as follows risk and insurance services 51 billion and consulting 23 billion given the significant size of the company  s goodwill and intangible assets an impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given period 

when we dispose of businesses we are subject to the risk contractually agreed or otherwise of posttransaction liabilities for example as described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item   8 of this report we have retained certain contingent litigation liabilities relating to kroll 

risks relating to our risk and insurance services segment 

our risk and insurance services segment conducted through marsh and guy carpenter represented 54 of the company  s total revenue in 2013 our business in this segment is subject to particular risks 

results in our risk and insurance services segment may be adversely affected by a general decline in economic activity 

demand for many types of insurance and reinsurance generally rises or falls as economic growth expands or slows this dynamic affects the level of commissions and fees generated by marsh and guy carpenter to the extent our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions they may choose to limit their purchases of insurance and reinsurance coverage as applicable which would inhibit our ability to generate commission revenue the insurance they seek to obtain through us may be impacted by changes in their assets property values sales or number of employees which may reduce our commission revenue and they may decide not to purchase our risk advisory services which would inhibit our ability to generate fee revenue moreover insolvencies and combinations associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies and combinations in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business guy carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the market place 

volatility or declines in premiums and other market trends may significantly impede our ability to improve revenues and profitability 

a significant portion of our risk and insurance services revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to the general phenomenon of pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their riskprotection needs this trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to “ selfinsure ”  the use of socalled “ captive ”  insurers and the advent of capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance and reinsurance needs further the profitability of our risk and insurances services segment depends in part on our ability to be compensated not only for insurance and reinsurance transactions but also for the increasing analytical services and advice that we provide if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for all of our services our margins and profitability could suffer 

risks relating to our consulting segment 

our consulting segment conducted through mercer and oliver wyman group represented 46 of our total revenue in 2013 our businesses in this segment are subject to particular risks 

demand for our services might decrease for various reasons including a general economic downturn a decline in a client  s or an industry  s financial condition or changes in government regulation 

global economic conditions over the past several years have resulted in negative impacts on businesses and financial institutions many of our clients including financial institutions corporations governmental entities and pension plans have been reducing expenses including amounts spent on consulting services the evolving needs or financial circumstances of our clients may challenge our ability to increase revenues and profitability and may reduce demand for our services if the economy or markets in which we operate experience continued weakness at current levels or deteriorate further our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition demand for many of mercer  s benefits services is affected by government regulation and tax rules which drive our clients   needs for benefitsrelated services for example significant changes in government regulations affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of mercer  s services 

factors impacting defined benefit pension plans and the services we provide relating to those plans could adversely affect mercer 

mercer currently provides corporate multiemployer and public clients with actuarial consulting and administration services relating to defined benefit pension plans the nature of our work is complex our actuarial services involve numerous assumptions and estimates regarding future events including interest rates used to discount future liabilities estimated rates of return for a plans assets healthcare cost trends salary projections and participants life expectancies our consulting services involve the drafting and interpretation of trust deeds and other complex documentation governing pension plans our administration services include calculating benefits within complicated pension plan structures clients dissatisfied with our services have brought and may bring significant claims against us particularly in the 

us and the uk in addition a number of mercers clients have frozen or curtailed their defined benefit plans and have moved to defined contribution plans resulting in reduced revenue for mercers retirement business these developments could adversely affect mercers business and operating results 

our profitability may suffer if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and pricing rates for our consultants 

the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on ensuring that our consultants maintain adequate utilization rates ie the percentage of our consultants   working hours devoted to billable activities our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 if the utilization rate for our consulting professionals declines our profit margin and profitability could suffer 

in addition the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on the prices we are able to charge for our services the prices we charge are affected by a number of factors including 

 if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for our services our profit margin and profitability could suffer

interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to 24 million in 2012 compared with 28 million in 2011 the decrease in interest income was due to lower average interest rates compared with the prior year interest expense was 181 million in 2012 compared with 199 million in 2011 the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on senior notes issued during the second half of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012 compared with the interest rate on notes that matured

investment income loss 

the caption “investment income” in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments recognized in current earnings it includes when applicable other than temporary declines in the value of debt and available for sale securities and the change in value of the companys holdings in certain private equity funds including equity method gains 

losses on its investment in the trident funds the companys investments may include direct investments in insurance or consulting companies and investments in private equity funds the company recorded gains on its investment in trident ii of 22 million and 35 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively including 15 million of deferred performance fees recognized in the first quarter of 2013 trident ii has now fully harvested all its portfolio investments and made final distributions to its partners during the fourth quarter of 2013 the company has now recognized all of the performance fees related to its general partnership interest in trident ii investment income for 2013 includes performance fees of 40 million related to the companys general partnership interest in trident iii which had been deferred but are no longer subject to claw back trident iii is a private equity fund created in 2003 prior to 2013 no trident iiirelated investment income had been recognized since 2006 when mmc contributed its limited partnership investment interest to its uk pension plan at december 31 2013 the company had deferred performance fees of   approximately   38 million related to trident iii recognition of these deferred performance fees will only occur as investments are harvested and the performance fees are no longer subject to claw back timing of this is unknown and is not controlled by the company 

in 2012 investment income was 24 million compared with 9 million in 2011 this increase was primarily due to higher marktomarket gains on private equity fund investments partly offset by an impairment loss on a debt security of 8 million 

income taxes 

the companys consolidated effective tax rate was 301 290 and 301 in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the tax rate in each year reflects foreign operations which are taxed at rates lower than the us statutory tax rate 

the lower effective tax rate attributed to the companys foreign operations primarily reflects lower corporate tax rates that prevail outside of the us net of the us tax impact from repatriating foreign earnings in 2013 pretax income in the uk canada australia france and bermuda accounted for approximately 60 of the companys total nonus pretax income with effective rates in those countries of 21 excluding the noncash deferred tax impact of uk tax legislation enacted in 2013 27 31 42 and 0 respectively under current us tax law the company anticipates its nonus operations will continue to incur taxes at rates below the us federal tax rate of 35 

the companys us revenue over the past three years has been approximately 45 of total revenue while over that period the pretax income from us locations varied from 9 to 21 of total pretax income 

as a us domiciled parent holding company marsh  mclennan companies inc is the issuer of essentially all of the companys external indebtedness and incurs the related interest expense in the us further most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the us and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the united states 

the effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future it is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of the companys earnings which may result in higher or lower tax rates a proportional increase in us pretax income will tend to increase the effective tax rate because us federal and state corporate tax rates exceed tax rates applicable outside the us losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax assets the effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation 

the realization of deferred tax assets depends on generating future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable the company and marsh have been profitable in the us and globally tax liabilities are determined and assessed on a legal entity and jurisdictional basis certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings the company assessed the realizability of its domestic deferred tax assets particularly state deferred tax assets of marsh relating to jurisdictions in which it files separate tax returns state deferred tax assets of all of the companys domestic operations related to jurisdictions in which the company files a unitary or combined state tax return and foreign tax credit carryforwards in the companys consolidated us federal tax return when making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at december 31 2013 

the company considered all available evidence placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified the evidence considered included i the profitability of the companys us operations throughout the period 2011 to 2013 ii the nature frequency and severity of losses incurred before 2011 iii profit trends evidenced by continued improvements in the companys and marshs operating performance iv the nonrecurring nature of some of the items that contributed to losses before 2011 v the carryforward periods for the net operating losses nols and foreign tax credit carryforwards vi the sources and timing of future taxable income giving weight to sources according to the extent to which they can be objectively verified and vii tax planning strategies that would be implemented if necessary to accelerate utilization of nols based on its assessment the company concluded that most of these deferred tax assets are realizable and a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce the domestic deferred tax assets to the amount that the company believes is more likely than not to be realized in the event sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods additional valuation allowances of up to approximately 195 million could be required relating to these domestic deferred tax assets the realization of the remaining us federal deferred tax assets is not as sensitive to us profits because it is supported by anticipated repatriation of future annual earnings from the companys profitable global operations consistent with the companys historical practice in addition when making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at december 31 2013 the company continued to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets of certain other entities with a history of recent losses including other us entities that file separate state tax returns and foreign subsidiaries and recorded valuation allowances as appropriate 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate for example proposals for fundamental us international tax reform if enacted could have a significant adverse impact on the effective tax rate 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of its own the company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to meet its obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to stockholders for share repurchases and for corporate expenses other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows 

the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the united states funds from the company’s operating subsidiaries located outside of the united states are regularly repatriated to the united states out of annual earnings at december 31 2013 the company had approximately 14 billion of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations substantially all of which is considered to be permanently invested in those operations to fund foreign investments and working capital needs at the current time the company does not intend to repatriate any of this cash the nonus cash and cash equivalents considered permanently reinvested includes approximately 190 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements the company expects to continue its practice of repatriating foreign funds out of current annual earnings while management does not foresee a need to repatriate the funds which are currently deemed permanently invested if facts or circumstances change management could elect to repatriate them if necessary which could result in higher effective tax rates in the future 

cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the company 

operating cash flows 

the company generated 13 billion of cash from operations in both 2013 and 2012 these amounts reflect the net income reported by the company during those periods excluding gains or losses from investments cost of extinguishment of debt and the disposition of businesses adjusted for noncash 

charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets 

pension related items 

during 2013 the company contributed 26 million to its us pension plans and 620 million to nonus pension plans which included contributions of 250 million to prefund all of the 2014 and a substantial portion of the 2015 deficit funding contributions for the uk plans and a discretionary contribution of 70 million to the canadian plans in 2012 the company contributed 124 million to us plans and 389 million to nonus plans which included 100 million of discretionary contributions to each of the us and the uk plans 

in the us contributions to the taxqualified defined benefit plans are based on erisa guidelines and the company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80 or more of the liability determined under the erisa guidelines the pension stabilization provisions included in the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act enacted on july 6 2012 changed the methodology for determining the discount rate used for calculating plan liabilities under erisa which determines in part the funding requirements after considering the impact of the pension funding stabilization provisions discussed above the company expects less than 1 million of contributions will be required for its us taxqualified plan through the end of 2014 the company also expects to fund approximately 24 million to its nonqualified us pension plans in 2014 

the company has a large number of nonus defined benefit pension plans the largest of which are in the uk which comprise approximately 82 of nonus plan assets contribution rates for nonus plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements which may differ significantly from measurements under us gaap in the uk contributions to defined benefit pension plans are determined through a negotiation process between the company and the plans trustee that typically occurs every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans this process is governed by uk pension regulations the assumptions that result from the funding negotiations are different from those used for us gaap and currently result in a lower funded status than under us gaap the current funding plan was based on assumptions including interest rates inflation salary increases and mortality that reflected market conditions as of yearend 2009 was agreed to in early 2011 and formed the basis for the companys aggregate contributions to the uk plans for 2011 through 2013 in 2013 the company made required contributions of 300 million to its nonus defined benefit pension plans including amounts called for under the uk funding plan additionally the company made a 250 million contribution to prefund certain deficit funding contributions for the uk plans described above and a 70 million discretionary contribution to its canadian plans the valuation of the uk pension plan at december 31 2012 that results from the negotiation process described above will determine funding that is expected to become applicable in 2014 contributions to the uk plans typically comprised of a portion related to the current service cost that is the benefits earned by employees in the current year plus an amount intended to reduce over time any deficit determined through the companys negotiations with the trustee in the aggregate the company expects to fund approximately 160 million to its nonus defined benefit plans in 2014 comprising approximately 90 million to plans outside of the uk and 70 million to the uk plans 

funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan 

after completion of a consultation period with affected colleagues in january 2014 the company amended its uk defined benefit pension plans to close those plans to future benefit accruals effective august 1 2014 and will replace those plans along with its existing defined contribution plans with a new comprehensive defined contribution arrangement as required under gaap the company remeasured the defined benefit plans’ assets and liabilities at the amendment date based on assumptions and market conditions at that date as a result of the remeasurement the projected benefit obligation pbo increased by approximately 147 million and the funded status decreased by approximately 137 million the change in the pbo and in the funded status relates primarily to a decrease in the discount rate at the remeasurement date the net periodic benefit costs recognized in 2014 will be the weighted average resulting from the december 31 2013 measurement and the january 2014 remeasurement the company will recognize a curtailment gain of 63 million in the first quarter of 2014 primarily resulting 

from the recognition of the remaining prior service credit related to a plan amendment made in december 2012 this gain will be mostly offset by a transition benefit to certain employees most impacted by the amendment as a result of the amendments to the uk plans the company expects an increase in contributions to its defined contribution plans of approximately 30 million related to the transfer of colleagues from defined benefit to defined contribution plans and funding of a portion of the transition benefit 

the yearoveryear change in the funded status of the companys pension plans is impacted by the variance between actual and assumed results particularly with regard to return on assets and changes in the discount rate as well as the amount of company contributions if any unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately 10 billion and 30 billion at december 31 2013 for the us plans and nonus plans respectively compared with 19 billion and 33 billion at december 31 2012 the decrease is primarily due to the impact of increases in the discount rates actual returns on plan assets in 2013 that were higher than the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets and discretionary contributions to the plans discussed above in the past several years the amount of actuarial losses has been significantly impacted both positively and negatively by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities increased in both the us and the uk the companys two largest plans in 2013 after decreasing in each of the four years from 2009 to 2012 at the end of 2009 the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 60 declining to 56 49 and 44 at the end of 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively in 2013 the weighted average discount rate increased to 48 an increase in the discount rate decreases the measured plan liability resulting in actuarial gains while a decrease in the discount rate increases the measured plan liability resulting in actuarial losses during 2013 the companys defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 126 and 86 in the us and uk respectively during 2012 the companys defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 141 and 98 in the us and uk respectively and in 2011 the actual returns were 58 in the us and 48 in the uk in 2012 and 2010 actuarial losses resulting from declines in the discount rate were partly offset by actual asset returns which exceeded the assumed rates of return in each year in 2011 both the decline in the discount rate and actual asset returns that were lower than the assumed rates of return contributed to the actuarial losses 

overall based on the measurement at december 31 2013 the company’s pension expense was expected to decrease in 2014 by approximately 128 million partly offset by compensation considerations approximately 85 of this decrease relates to the us plans the decrease in the expected us pension expense results primarily from an increase in the discount rates used to measure us plan liabilities along with the impact of an increase in plan assets at the end of 2013 resulting from investment returns the remainder of the decrease relates to plans outside of the us resulting from a modest increase in the discount rate and an increase in plan assets resulting from both asset performance and contributions 

as a result of the plan remeasurement to reflect the amendments to the uk plans described above an incremental decrease of approximately 31 million for defined benefit pension expense is expected for 2014 primarily resulting from the elimination of the service cost component effective august 1 2014 however the decrease in the defined benefit pension cost resulting from the amendment will be largely offset by increased cost for the new defined contribution plan which will replace the existing defined benefit plans in the uk

the above does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 128 million as the company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities other than approximately 7 million that may become payable during 2014 the above does not include the indemnified liabilities discussed in note 15 as the company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities the above does not include net pension liabilities of approximately 900 million because the timing and amount of ultimate payment of such liability is dependent upon future events including but not limited to future returns on plan assets and changes in the discount rate used to measure the liabilities the amounts of estimated future benefits payments to be made from plan assets are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in 2014 the company expects to contribute approximately 25 million and 160 million to its us and nonus pension plans respectively 

management’s discussion of critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from those estimates 

legal and other loss contingencies 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions gaap requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance the company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel an internal actuarial analysis and other analyses to estimate potential losses the liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable given the unpredictability of eo claims and of litigation that could flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the company’s businesses results of operations financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period 

in addition to the extent that insurance coverage is available significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the company’s various insurance programs 

retirement benefits 

the company maintains qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible us employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible nonus employees the company’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable foreign laws 

the company recognizes the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” net of tax in the company’s consolidated balance sheets the gains and losses that exceed specified corridors are amortized prospectively out of aoci over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees or for plans in which substantially all the participants are inactive over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive employees 

the determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate mortality and assumed rate of salary increase significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements the company believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate based on its current assumptions the company expects pension expense in 2014 to decrease approximately 128 million compared with 2013 partly offset by compensation considerations 

future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions future investment performance future assumptions and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans holding all other assumptions constant a halfpercentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the us and uk plans which together comprise approximately 86 of total pension plan liabilities as follows 



changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense because the longterm rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost 

the company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees the cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the us is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire but is funded by the company as incurred the key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the companys tax rate reflects its income statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions the company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the evaluation of a tax position is a twostep process the first step involves recognition the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on only the technical merits of the position the technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes legislative intent 

regulations rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 

uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue 

tax law requires items be included in the companys tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements in assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly the company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company also considers taxplanning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carryback of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law the underlying assumptions the company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the companys recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carryforwards are deductible or creditable valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction 

fair value determinations 

goodwill impairment testing—the company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred the company performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year in 2013 the company elected to not use the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a step 1 impairment test was necessary and instead elected to perform a step 1 impairment test fair values of the reporting units are estimated using either a market approach or discounted cash flow model this fair value determination was categorized as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level 

the company completed its 2013 annual review in the third quarter and concluded goodwill was not impaired as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin 

sharebased payment 

the guidance for accounting for sharebased payments requires among other things that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values in addition management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans 

and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards as defined by the accounting guidance 

as of december 31 2013 there was 17 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards the weightedaverage periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 12 years also as of december 31 2013 there was 74 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the company’s restricted stock restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards the weightedaverage period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is approximately one year

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk and credit risk 

certain of the company’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets 

interest rate risk and credit risk 

the company has historically managed its net exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing a mixture of variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance the company’s asset base in february 2011 the company entered into two 35year interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of the first 250 million of its 5375 senior notes due in 2014 under the terms of the swaps the counterparties will pay the company a fixed rate of 5375 and the company will pay interest at a floating rate of threemonth libor plus a fixed spread of 3726 the swaps are designated as fair value hedging instruments and are deemed to be perfectly effective in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 

interest income generated from the company’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates 

the company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates   



based on the above balances if shortterm interest rates increased or decreased by 10 or 8 basis points over the course of the year annual interest income including interest earned on fiduciary funds would increase or decrease by approximately 3 million 

in addition to interest rate risk our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counterparty credit risk to minimize this risk the company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a board approved investment policy the policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counterparty limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment the company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions the majority of cash and fiduciary fund investments are invested in shortterm bank deposits and liquid money market funds 

foreign currency risk 

the translated values of revenue and expense from the company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates the nonus based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 55 of total revenue we periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business although the company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location as such the us dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the us dollar generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk the company estimates that a 10   movement of major foreign currencies euro sterling australian dollar and canadian dollar in the same direction against the us dollar that held constant over the course of the year would increase or decrease full year operating income by approximately 47 million 

equity price risk 

the company holds investments in both public and private companies as well as private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies publicly traded investments of 18 million are classified as available for sale nonpublicly traded investments of 14 million are accounted for using the cost method and 89 million are accounted for using the equity method the investments that are classified as available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of changes in market value which if determined to be other than temporary could result in realized impairment losses the company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements

 item 1a risk factors   

you should consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information presented in this report these risks have the potential to materially adversely affect the company  s business results of operations or financial condition 

risks relating to the company generally 

legal and regulatory issues 

we are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from “ errors and omissions ”  claims 

our operating companies provide numerous professional services including the placement of insurance and the provision of consulting actuarial and other services for corporate and public clients around the world as a result of these activities the company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of errors and omissions or “ eo ”  claims particularly in our marsh and mercer businesses in the us and the uk in our risk and insurance services segment such claims include allegations of damages arising from our failure to adequately place coverage or notify insurers of potential claims on behalf of clients in our consulting segment such claims include allegations of damages arising from our actuarial consulting pension administration and other services which frequently involve 1 assumptions and estimates concerning contingent future events 2 complex drafting and interpretation of documentation governing pension plans and 3 calculating benefits within complicated pension structures given the longtail nature of professional liability claims eo matters often relate to services provided by the company dating back many years in each of our segments eo claims seek damages including punitive and treble damages in amounts that could if awarded be significant and subject us to potential liability for monetary damages negative publicity reputational harm and to diversion of personnel and management resources 

in establishing liabilities for errors and omissions claims in accordance with fasb asc subtopic no   45020 contingencies  loss contingencies the company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel an internal actuarial analysis and other analysis to estimate potential losses a liability is established when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable the liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable nevertheless given the unpredictability of eo claims and of litigation that could flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular 

  12   

matter could have a material adverse effect on the company  s businesses results of operations financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period 

to the extent that expected losses exceed our deductible in any policy year the company also records an asset for the amount that we expect to recover under any available thirdparty insurance programs the company has varying levels of thirdparty insurance coverage with policy limits and coverage terms varying significantly by policy year 

further as more fully described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item   8 of this report we are subject to legal proceedings regulatory investigations and other contingencies other than eo claims which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our internal systems and controls cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable us federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states and its various states the european union and its member states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate for example we are subject to regulation by foreign and domestic governments regulatory agencies such as the sec in the united states and the fsa in the united kingdom and selfregulatory organizations 

such as finra as described further above under part i item   1   business regulation of this report the foreign and us laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations are complex and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance limit or restrict the products or services we sell or subject our business to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings these laws and regulations include trade sanctions laws such as the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010 local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials as well as import and export restrictions 

as a publiclytraded company we are subject to additional federal state and other rules and regulations including those required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act compliance with the requirements of these laws and regulations may be costly and adversely affect our business 

while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we our employees our consultants or our contractors are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws or regulations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations including those referred to above we may be subject to investigations criminal sanctions or civil remedies including fines injunctions loss of an operating license or approval increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in a particular business or redress to clients the cost of compliance or the consequences of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations or financial condition in addition these matters could have a material adverse effect on the company by exposing us to negative publicity reputational damage or harm to our client or employee relationships 

in most jurisdictions government regulatory authorities have the power to interpret or amend applicable laws and regulations and have discretion to grant renew and revoke various licenses and approvals we need to conduct our activities such authorities may require the company to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations in some areas of our businesses we act on the basis of our own or the industry  s interpretations of applicable laws or regulations which may conflict from state to state or country to country in the event those interpretations eventually prove different from those of regulatory authorities we might be penalized or precluded from carrying on our previous activities moreover the laws and regulations to which we are subject may conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate 

the method by which insurance intermediaries are compensated has received substantial scrutiny in the past decade because of the potential for conflicts of interest the amount of compensation that we receive from insurance companies including in the form of consulting and other services has increased 

  13   

in the last two years future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to earn certain revenue streams adverse regulatory developments regarding the forms of compensation that we earn could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

finally government involvement in the insurance or reinsurance markets could displace insurance or reinsurance currently available from the private market and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation 

in many jurisdictions we are subject to laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of our clients   confidential and proprietary information and the personal information of our employees our individual customers and our clients   employees and retirement and other benefit plan participants in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information among our affiliates we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information nonetheless we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personal information such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts as well as laws and regulations resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

further data privacy is subject to frequently changing laws rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate for example a revision to the 1995 european union data protection directive is currently being considered by european legislative bodies that may include more stringent operation requirements and significant penalties for noncompliance our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing legal or regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace as well as the general risks described above relating to our compliance systems and controls 

financial risks 

our pension obligations may cause the company  s earnings and cash flows to fluctuate 

the company has significant pension obligations to its current and former employees totaling approximately 138 billion and related plan assets of approximately 122 billion at december 31 2012 the company  s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth by us law and the laws of the nonus jurisdictions in which the company offers defined benefit plans in the us contributions to the taxqualified defined benefit plans are based on erisa guidelines contribution rates for nonus plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements which may differ from measurements under us gaap in the uk for example contributions to defined benefit pension plans are determined through a negotiation process between the company and the plans trustee that typically occurs every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans   this process is governed by uk pension regulations the assumptions that result from the funding negotiations are different from those used for us gaap and currently result in a lower funded status than under us gaap 

during 2012 the company contributed 124 million to its us pension plans and 389 million to nonus pension plans as more fully described in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements funding amounts will be impacted by future asset performance the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities rates of inflation mortality assumptions and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in accordance with asc topic no 715 the company reflects the over or underfunded amount of its pension plans as assets or liabilities respectively given the magnitude of our worldwide pension plans variations in any of the preceding factors could cause significant fluctuation in our earnings as well as our equity from year to year and may result in increased levels of contributions to our pension plans particularly in the uk 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients   businesses and levels of business activity 

global economic and political conditions affect our clients   businesses and the markets they serve these economic conditions may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing of those services which 

  14   

could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain should it become necessary for us to restructure our business including reducing our work force as a result of market conditions or other factors that reduce the demand for our products and services our ability to execute our business strategy could be adversely affected 

financial institution failures may cause us to incur increased expenses or make it more difficult either to utilize our existing debt capacity or otherwise obtain financing for our operations investing activities including the financing of any future acquisitions or financing activities 

our cash investments including those held in a fiduciary capacity are subject to general credit liquidity counterparty market and interest rate risks that may be exacerbated by the difficulties faced by financial institution counterparties if the banking system or the fixed income credit or equity markets deteriorate the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected 

concerns regarding the european debt crisis and market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro could adversely affect the companys operating results as well as the value of the companys eurodenominated assets 

concerns persist regarding the ability of certain eurozone countries to service their debt obligations as a result a number of these countries have undertaken a variety of actions such as cutting spending and raising taxes designed to ease their future debt burdens a potential consequence may be stagnant growth or even recession in the eurozone economies and beyond also the stability of the euro and its viability as a single currency is being called into question in the future certain countries may find it advantageous to leave the eurozone and reintroduce their local currencies to retain better control over their economic situations a more extreme outcome is the complete dissolution of the euro any of these developments could lead to further contraction in the eurozone economies adversely affecting our operating results in the region the company may also face increased   credit risk as our clients and financial institution counterparties in the region find themselves with reduced resources to meet their obligations finally the value of the companys assets held in the eurozone including cash holdings will decline if the currency devalues 

our significant nonus operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business 

we are subject to exchange rate risk because some of our subsidiaries receive revenue other than in their functional currencies and because we must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in certain jurisdictions however our risk and insurance services operations generate revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in local currency due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we are subject to economic exposure as well as currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations exchange rate risk could have a significant impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

increased counterparty risk and changes in interest rates could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and adversely affect our financial results 

during times of stress in the banking industry counterparty risk can quickly escalate potentially resulting in substantial trading and investment losses for corporate and other investors in addition we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may continue to experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain low 

credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk 

currently the companys senior debt is rated baa2 by moodys and bbb by sp these ratings are the nexttolowest investment grade rating for each of moodys and sp ratings from both sp and moodys currently carry a stable outlook 

  15   

if we need to raise capital in the future for example in order to fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives a credit rating downgrade would increase our financing costs and could limit our access to financing sources further we believe that a downgrade to a rating below investmentgrade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

the company is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to stockholders and for corporate expenses in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and other payments to the company we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on common stock 

further the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the us since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are made from the us it is important to be able to access cash generated outside the us 

funds from the companys operating subsidiaries outside the us are regularly repatriated to the us via stockholder distributions and intercompany financings a number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive including but not limited to foreign exchange rates and taxrelated costs 

in the event we are unable to generate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate 

our quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly 

quarterly variations in revenues and operating results may occur due to several factors these include 

 a significant portion of our total operating expenses is relatively fixed in the short term therefore a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results for these businesses 

international operations 

we are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations 

we do business worldwide in 2012 56 of the company  s total revenue was generated from operations outside the united states and over onehalf of our employees are located outside the united states we expect to expand our nonus operations further 

the geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal economic operational market compliance and reputational risks these include among others risks relating to 

  16   

 our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake hurricane terrorist attack pandemic security breach cyber attack power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems would provide us with an important advantage nevertheless we could still experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations such as key executive officers or personnel 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario 

we regularly assess and take steps to improve upon our existing business continuity plans and key management succession however a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability 

competitive risks 

  17   

each of the company  s businesses operates in a highly competitive environment if we fail to compete effectively our business and results of operations will suffer 

as a global professional services firm the company faces acute and continuous competition in each of its operating segments our ability to compete successfully depends on a variety of factors including our geographic reach the sophistication and quality of our services our pricing relative to competitors and our customers   option to selfinsure or utilize internal resources instead of consultants if we are unable to respond successfully to the competition we face our business and results of operations will suffer 

in addition given the global breadth of the company  s operations the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the united states funds from the company  s operating subsidiaries located outside the us are regularly repatriated to the united states out of annual earnings to pay dividends to stockholders fund share repurchases and for other corporate purposes the company  s consolidated tax rate is higher than a number of its key competitors that are domiciled outside the united states where corporate tax rates are lower than the us statutory tax rate the consolidated tax rate at which our earnings are taxed could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete with our peers 

in our risk and insurance services segment we compete intensely against a wide range of other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a global regional national or local scale for both client business and employee talent we compete as well with insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or other market intermediaries and with various other companies that provide riskrelated services the above competition is intensified by an industry trend toward a “ syndicated ”  or “ distributed ”  approach to the purchase of insurance and reinsurance brokerage services whereby a client engages multiple brokers to service different portions of the client  s account 

in our consulting segment we compete for business and employee talent with numerous consulting firms and organizations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms around the world 

the loss of key professionals could hurt our ability to retain existing client revenues and generate revenues from new business 

across all of our businesses our colleagues are critical to developing and retaining the client relationships on which our revenues depend it is therefore very important for us to retain significant revenueproducing employees and the key managerial and other professionals who support them we face numerous challenges in this regard including the intense competition for talent in all of our businesses and the general mobility of professionals in our businesses 

losing employees who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements which would adversely affect our results of operations in addition if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 

consolidation in the industries we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge 

or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business guy carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the marketplace 

our businesses face rapid technological changes and our failure to adequately anticipate or respond to these changes or to successfully implement strategic initiatives could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  18   

to remain competitive in many of our business areas we must identify the most current technologies and methodologies and integrate them into our service offerings in addition we have a number of strategic initiatives involving investments in technology systems and infrastructure to support our growth strategy in addition to new platforms and systems we are deploying new processes and many of our colleagues across the business are changing the way they perform certain roles to capture efficiencies if we do not keep up with technological changes or execute well on our strategic initiatives our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

acquisitions and dispositions 

we face risks when we acquire and dispose of businesses 

we have a history of making acquisitions including a total of 41 acquisitions in the period 20092012 for aggregate purchase consideration of 17 billion we have also exited various businesses including the sale of putnam investments trust  “ putnam ”  in august 2007 and the sale of kroll in 2010 we expect that acquisitions will continue to be a key part of our business strategy our success in this regard will depend on our ability to identify and compete for appropriate acquisition candidates and to complete with favorable results the transactions we decide to pursue 

while we intend that our acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability we cannot be certain that our past or future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations acquisitions involve special risks including accounting regulatory compliance information technology or human resources issues that could arise in connection with or as a result of the acquisition of the acquired company the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue profit or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect in addition if in the future the performance of our reporting units or an acquired business varies from our projections or assumptions or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units or an acquired business change the estimated fair value of our reporting units or an acquired business could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill and other acquisitionrelated intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet or in adjustments in contingent payment amounts as of december   31 2012 the company  s consolidated balance sheet reflected 73 billion of goodwill and intangible assets representing approximately 45 of the company  s total consolidated assets and allocated by reporting segment as follows risk and insurance services 51 billion and consulting 22 billion given the significant size of the company  s goodwill and intangible assets an impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given period 

when we dispose of businesses we are subject to the risk contractually agreed or otherwise of posttransaction liabilities for example as described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item   8 of this report we have retained certain contingent litigation liabilities relating to kroll 

risks relating to our risk and insurance services segment 

our risk and insurance services segment conducted through marsh and guy carpenter represented 55 of the company  s total revenue in 2012 our business in this segment is subject to particular risks 

results in our risk and insurance services segment may be adversely affected by a general decline in economic activity 

demand for many types of insurance and reinsurance generally rises and falls as economic growth expands or slows this dynamic affects the level of commissions and fees generated by marsh and guy carpenter to the extent our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions they may choose to limit their purchases of insurance and reinsurance coverage as applicable which would inhibit our ability to generate commission revenue and may decide not to purchase our risk advisory services which would inhibit our ability to generate fee revenue moreover insolvencies and combinations associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies and combinations in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business guy carpenter is especially 

  19   

susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the market place 

volatility or declines in premiums and other market trends may significantly impede our ability to improve revenues and profitability 

a significant portion of our risk and insurance services revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to the general phenomenon of pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their riskprotection needs this trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to “ selfinsure ”  the use of socalled “ captive ”  insurers and the advent of capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance and reinsurance needs further the profitability of our risk and insurances services segment depends in part on our ability to be compensated not only for insurance and reinsurance transactions but for the increasing analytical services and advice that we provide if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for all of our services our margins and profitability could suffer 

risks relating to our consulting segment 

our consulting segment conducted through mercer and oliver wyman group represented 45 of our total revenue in 2012 our businesses in this segment are subject to particular risks 

demand for our services might decrease for various reasons including a general economic downturn a decline in a client  s or an industry  s financial condition or changes in government regulation 

our consulting segment has historically achieved annual revenue growth despite this history however global economic conditions over the past several years have resulted in negative impacts on businesses and financial institutions many of our clients including financial institutions corporations governmental entities and pension plans have been reducing expenses including amounts spent on consulting services the evolving needs or financial circumstances of our clients may challenge our ability to increase revenues and profitability and reduce demand for our services if the economy or markets in which we operate experience continued weakness at current levels or deteriorate further our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition demand for many of mercer  s benefits services is affected by government regulation and tax rules which drive our clients   needs for benefitsrelated services for example significant changes in government regulations affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of mercer  s services 

factors impacting defined benefit pension plans and the services we provide relating to those plans could adversely affect mercer 

mercer currently provides corporate multiemployer and public clients with actuarial consulting and administration services relating to defined benefit pension plans the nature of our work is complex our actuarial services involve numerous assumptions and estimates regarding future events including interest rates used to discount future liabilities estimated rates of return for a plans assets healthcare cost trends salary projections and participants life expectancies our consulting services involve complex drafting and interpretation of trust deeds and other documentation governing pension plans our administration services include calculating benefits within complicated pension plan structures clients dissatisfied with our services have brought and may bring significant claims against us particularly in the us and the uk in addition a number of mercers clients have frozen or curtailed their defined benefit plans and have moved to defined contribution plans resulting in reduced revenue for mercers retirement business these developments could adversely affect mercers business and operating results 

  20   

our profitability may suffer if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and pricing rates for our consultants 

the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on ensuring that our consultants maintain adequate utilization rates ie the percentage of our consultants   working hours devoted to billable activities our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 if the utilization rate for our consulting professionals declines our profit margin and profitability may suffer 

in addition the profitability of our consulting businesses depends on the prices we are able to charge for our services our pricing power is affected by a number of factors including 

 if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for our services our margins and profitability could suffer 

if we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we typically bill and collect on relatively short cycles there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of client balances depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected

other corporate items 

interest 

interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to 24 million in 2012 compared with 28 million in 2011 the decrease in interest income is due to lower average interest rates compared with the prior year interest expense was 181 million in 2012 compared with 199 million in 2011 the decrease is primarily due to lower interest rates on senior notes issued during the second half of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012 compared to the interest rate on notes that matured 

interest income earned on corporate funds was 28 million in 2011 compared with 20 million in 2010 the increase in interest income was due to the combined effect of higher average invested funds in 2011 and slightly higher average interest rates compared with the prior year interest expense was 199 million in 2011 compared with 233 million in 2010 the decrease was primarily due to the maturity of senior notes in the third quarter of 2010 the early extinguishment of a portion of the companys outstanding notes during the third quarter of 2011 and a lower net interest rate on the companys debt subject to interest rate swaps these decreases were partly offset by interest on new senior notes issued during the third quarter of 2011 

early extinguishment of debt 

on july 15 2011 the company purchased 600 million of the outstanding notes comprised of 330 million of its 2014 notes and 270 million of its 2015 notes collectively the notes the company acquired the notes at market value plus a tender premium which exceeded its carrying value and resulted in a charge of approximately 72 million in the third quarter of 2011 

investment income loss 

in 2012 investment income was 24 million compared with 9 million in 2011 this increase is primarily due to higher marktomarket gains on private equity fund investments partly offset by an impairment loss on a debt security of 8 million 

in 2011 investment income was 9 million compared with 43 million in 2010 this decrease primarily reflects the impact of lower private equity gains recorded in 2011 as compared to 2010 the effects of recording an impairment loss in 2011 and a gain on the sale of equity securities in 2010 

income taxes 

the companys consolidated effective tax rate was 290 301 and 265 in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the tax rate in each year reflects foreign operations which are taxed at rates lower than the us statutory tax rate 

 the lower effective tax rate attributed to the companys foreign operations primarily reflects lower corporate tax rates that prevail outside of the us net of the us tax impact from repatriating foreign earnings in 2012 pretax income in the uk canada australia and bermuda accounted for approximately 60 of the companys total nonus pretax income with effective rates in those countries of 24 excluding the noncash deferred tax impact of uk tax legislation enacted in 2012 27 30 and 0 respectively under current us tax law the company anticipates its nonus operations will continue to incur taxes at rates below the us federal tax rate of 35 

the companys nonus revenue over the past three years has been approximately 55 of total revenue while the pretax income from nonus locations varied from 77 to 138 of total pretax income although revenue in the united states has been approximately 45 of total revenue while the company had gains in its us operations in 2011 and 2012 the company incurred pretax losses in the united states during 2010 as a result of a significant charge from the resolution of the armb matter which is discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the company had pretax income in its us operations in 2011 and 2012 

in addition as a us domiciled parent holding company marsh  mclennan companies inc is the issuer for essentially all of the companys external indebtedness and incurs the related interest expense in the us finally most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the us and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the united states 

  36   

the effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future it is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of the companys earnings which may result in higher or lower tax rates a proportional increase in us pretax income will tend to increase the effective tax rate because us federal and state corporate tax rates often exceed tax rates applicable outside the us losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax assets the effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation 

the realization of deferred tax assets depends on generating future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable the company and marsh have been profitable globally however tax liabilities are determined and assessed on a legal entity and jurisdictional basis certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings in the united states certain groups within the company which file on a combined basis were profitable in 2011 and 2012 but incurred a loss in 2010 as a result of the resolution of the armb matter the company assessed the realizability of its domestic deferred tax assets particularly state deferred tax assets of marsh relating to jurisdictions in which it files separate tax returns state deferred tax assets of all of the companys domestic operations related to jurisdictions in which the company files a unitary or combined state tax return and foreign tax credit carryforwards in the companys consolidated us federal tax return when making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at december 31 2012 the company considered all available evidence placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified the evidence considered included i the profitability of the companys us operations in 2011 and 2012 and the cumulative period from 2010 through 2012 ii the nature frequency and severity of losses incurred before 2011 iii profit trends evidenced by continued improvements in the companys and marshs operating performance iv the nonrecurring nature of some of the items that contributed to losses before 2011 v the carryforward periods for the net operating losses nols and foreign tax credit carryforwards vi the sources and timing of future taxable income giving weight to sources according to the extent to which they can be objectively verified and vii tax planning strategies that would be implemented if necessary to accelerate utilization of nols based on its assessment the company concluded that it is more likely than not that a substantial portion of these deferred tax assets are realizable and a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce the domestic deferred tax assets to the amount that the company believes is more likely than not to be realized in the event sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods additional valuation allowances of up to approximately 270 million could be required relating to these domestic deferred tax assets the realization of the remaining us federal deferred tax assets is not as sensitive to us profits because it is supported by anticipated repatriation of future annual earnings from the companys profitable global operations consistent with the companys historical practice in addition when making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at december 31 2012 the company continued to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets of certain other entities with a history of recent losses including other us entities that file separate state tax returns and foreign subsidiaries and recorded valuation allowances as appropriate 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate for example proposals for fundamental us international tax reform if enacted could have a significant adverse impact on the effective tax rate 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of its own the company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to meet its obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to stockholders and for corporate expenses other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows 

the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the united states funds from the company’s operating subsidiaries located outside of the united states are regularly repatriated to the united states out of annual earnings at december 31 2012 the company had approximately 13 billion of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations 

  37   

of which all but approximately 80 million is considered to be permanently invested in those operations to fund foreign investments and working capital needs the nonus cash and cash equivalents considered permanently reinvested includes approximately 250 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements the company expects to continue its practice of repatriating foreign funds out of current annual earnings while management does not foresee a need to repatriate the funds which are currently deemed permanently invested if facts or circumstances change management could elect to repatriate them if necessary which could result in higher effective tax rates in the future 

cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the company 

operating cash flows 

the company generated 13 billion of cash from operations in 2012 compared with 17 billion in 2011 these amounts reflect the net income reported by the company during those periods excluding gains or losses from investments and the disposition of businesses adjusted for noncash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets the reduction in cash generated from operations is primarily due to the cash refunds of us federal income taxes received in 2011 discussed below cash generated from the disposition of businesses is included in investing cash flows 

the company received 322 million in cash refunds of us federal income taxes during the second quarter of 2011 comprising 212 million from carrying back the net capital loss incurred in 2010 from the sale of kroll and various other assets and 110 million from the cash settlement of the irs audit for the periods 2006 through 2008 the audit settlement primarily reflected the allowance of carry back claims for net operating losses and excess foreign tax credits arising in 2008 the impact on the tax provision of these events was reflected in prior periods and did not impact income tax expense reported in 2011 

on june 11 2010 the company resolved the litigation brought by the armb on behalf of two alaska benefit plans against mercer relating to work in the period 1992 to 2004 under the terms of the settlement agreement mercer paid 500 million of which 100 million was covered by insurance 

pension related items 

during 2012 the company contributed 124 million to its us pension plans and 389 million to nonus pension plans which includes discretionary contributions of 100 million to each of the us and the uk plans compared with 24 million for us plans and 320 million for nonus plans in 2011 

in the us contributions to the taxqualified defined benefit plans are based on erisa guidelines and the company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80 or more of the liability determined under the erisa guidelines the pension stabilization provisions included in the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act enacted on july 6 2012 changed the methodology for determining the discount rate used for calculating plan liabilities under erisa which determines in part the funding requirements     after considering the impact of the pension funding stabilization provisions discussed above the company does not expect any contributions will be required to its us taxqualified plan through the end of 2014 the company expects to fund approximately 25 million to its nonqualified us pension plans in 2013 

the company has a large number of nonus defined benefit pension plans the largest of which are in the uk which comprise approximately 82 of nonus plan assets contribution rates for nonus plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements which may differ significantly from measurements under us gaap in the uk contributions to defined benefit pension plans are determined through a negotiation process between the company and the plans trustee that typically occurs every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans this process is governed by uk pension regulations the assumptions that result from the funding negotiations are different from those used for us gaap and currently result in a lower funded status than under us gaap the current funding plan was based on assumptions including interest rates inflation salary increases and 

  38   

mortality that reflected market conditions as of yearend 2009 was agreed to in early 2011 and forms the basis for the companys aggregate contributions to the uk plans for 2011 through 2013 in 2012 the company made required contributions of 289 million to its nonus defined benefit pension plans including amounts called for under the uk funding plan additionally the company made a 100 million discretionary contribution to the uk plans the valuation of the uk pension plan at december 31 2012 that results from the negotiation process described above will determine funding that is expected to become applicable in 2014 contributions to the uk plans typically comprised of a portion related to the current service cost that is the benefits earned by employees in the current year plus an amount intended to reduce over time any deficit determined through the companys negotiations with the trustee the company anticipates contributing approximately 250 million in march 2013 to prefund all or a substantial portion of any deficit funding contributions that may be required from 2014 through 2016 as a result of the negotiations with the trustee in the aggregate the company expects to fund 623 million to its nonus plans in 2013 comprising 171 million to plans outside of the uk including a 70 million discretionary contribution to a canadian plan in january 2013 and 452 million to the uk plans 

funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan 

the yearoveryear change in the funded status of the companys pension plans is impacted by the variance between actual and assumed results particularly with regard to return on assets and changes in the discount rate as well as the amount of company contributions if any unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately 19 billion and 33 billion at december 31 2012 for the us plans and nonus plans respectively compared with 17 billion and 30 billion at december 31 2011 the increase is primarily due to the impact of decreases in the discount rates partly offset by actual returns on plan assets in 2012 that were higher than the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets in the past several years the amount of actuarial losses has been significantly impacted both positively and negatively by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities declined in both the us and the uk the companys two largest plans in each of the four years for 2009 to 2012 at the end of 2009 the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 60 declining to 56 49 and 44 at the end of 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively a decline in the discount rate increases the measured plan liability resulting in actuarial losses during 2012 the companys defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 141 and 99 in the us and uk respectively during 2011 the companys defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 58 and 48 in the us and uk respectively and in 2010 the actual returns were 144 in the us and 135 in the uk in 2012 and 2010 actuarial losses resulting from declines in the discount rate were partly offset by actual asset returns which exceeded the assumed rates of return in each year in 2011 both the decline in the discount rate and actual asset returns that were lower than the assumed rates of return contributed to the actuarial losses 

overall the company’s pension expense is expected to increase in 2013 by approximately 30 million before the partlyoffsetting impacts on bonuses and other incentive compensation and possible movements in foreign exchange rates the increase in the expected pension expense in 2013 results primarily from a decline in the discount rates used to measure plan liabilities partly offsetting this increase is the impact of an increase in plan assets resulting from both investment returns and contributionsthe impact of these higher asset levels is partly offset by a reduction in the weighted average assumed rate of return related to the nonus plans

management’s discussion of critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from those estimates 

legal and other loss contingencies 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions gaap requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance the company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel an internal actuarial analysis and other analyses to estimate potential losses the liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable given the unpredictability of eo claims and of litigation that could flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the company’s businesses results of operations financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period 

in addition to the extent that insurance coverage is available significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the company’s various insurance programs

the company maintains qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible us employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible nonus employees the company’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable foreign laws 

the company recognizes the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” net of tax in the company’s consolidated balance sheets the gains and losses that exceed specified corridors are amortized prospectively out of aoci over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees or for plans in which substantially all the participants are inactive over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive employees 

the determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate mortality and assumed rate of salary increase significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements the company believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate based on its current assumptions the company expects pension expense in 2013 to increase approximately 30 million compared with 2012 before partlyoffsetting impacts of bonuses and other incentive compensation and possible movements in foreign exchange rates 

  42   

future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions future investment performance future assumptions and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans holding all other assumptions constant a halfpercentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the us and uk plans which together comprise approximately 88 of total pension plan liabilities as follows 



changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense because the longterm rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost 

the company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees the cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the us is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire but is funded by the company as incurred the key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the companys tax rate reflects its income statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions the company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the evaluation of a tax position is a twostep process the first step involves recognition the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on only the technical merits of the position the technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes legislative intent regulations rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 

uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue 

tax law requires items be included in the companys tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements in assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly the company evaluates all significant available positive and 

  43   

negative evidence including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company also considers taxplanning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carryback of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law the underlying assumptions the company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the companys recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carryforwards are deductible or creditable valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction 

fair value determinations 

investment valuation—the company holds investments in private companies as well as certain private equity funds certain investments primarily investments in private equity funds are accounted for using the equity method although not directly recorded in the company’s consolidated balance sheets the company defined benefit pension plans hold investments of approximately 122 billion the fair value of these investments determines in part the overor underfunded status of those plans which is included in the company’s consolidated balance sheets the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements the company bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they relate to each investment fair value of investments in private equity funds is determined by the funds’ investment managers factors considered in determining the fair value of private equity investments include implied valuation of recently completed financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors performance multiples of comparable public companies restrictions on the sale or disposal of the investments trading characteristics of the securities and the relative size of the holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public market float in those instances where quoted market prices are not available particularly for equity holdings in private companies or formal restrictions limit the sale of securities significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate value of the company’s investments the company reviews with the fund manager the appropriateness of valuation results for significant private equity investments 

goodwill impairment testing—the company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred the company performs the annual goodwill impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year the company adopted new accounting guidance in the third quarter of 2011 under this guidance a company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test if as a result of this qualitative assessment a company determines the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not lower than its carrying value a step 1 impairment assessment must be performed the company considered the totality of numerous factors which included that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin in its most recent estimate of reporting unit fair values whether significant acquisitions or dispositions occurred which might alter the fair values of its reporting units macroeconomic conditions and their potential impact on reporting unit fair values actual performance compared with budget and prior projections used in its estimation of reporting unit fair values industry and market conditions and the year over year change in the companys share price 

based on its qualitative evaluation the company concluded that a twostep goodwill impairment test was not required in 2012 

sharebased payment 

the guidance for accounting for sharebased payments requires among other things that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values in addition management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards as defined by the accounting guidance

regulation 

the company’s activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under united states federal and state laws as well as laws of other countries in which the company’s subsidiaries operate see part i item 1a “risk factors” below for a discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our businesses 

risk and insurance services  while laws and regulations vary from location to location every state of the united states and most foreign jurisdictions require insurance market intermediaries and related service providers such as insurance brokers agents and consultants reinsurance brokers managing general agents and third party administrators to hold an individual andor company license from a governmental agency or selfregulatory organization some jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locallyowned business entities in those instances if the company has no licensed subsidiary it may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction such arrangements are subject to an internal review and approval process licensing of reinsurance intermediary brokers is generally less rigorous as compared to insurance regulation and most jurisdictions require only corporate reinsurance intermediary licenses 

beginning in january 2005 all european union member states were required to implement the insurance mediation directive this directive aims to apply consistent minimum professional standards to insurance and reinsurance intermediaries including a licensing system based on an assessment of factors such as professional competence financial capacity and professional indemnity insurance the adoption by member states of the european union of regulations to comply with the directive has led our insurance intermediary operations in the european union to become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements in january 2005 as part of the implementation of the directive in the united kingdom the power and responsibilities of the financial services authority or fsa were expanded to include regulation of insurance and reinsurance intermediaries in the united kingdom 

insurance authorities in the united states and certain other jurisdictions in which the companys subsidiaries do business including the fsa in the united kingdom also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others these laws and regulations typically provide for segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them and generally apply to both the insurance and reinsurance business 

  8   

certain of the companys risk and insurance services activities are governed by other regulatory bodies such as investment securities and futures licensing authorities in the united states marsh and guy carpenter use the services of mmc securities corp a brokerdealer and investment adviser registered in the us with the sec and a member of the financial industry regulatory agency finra and the securities investor protection corporation sipc primarily in connection with investment bankingrelated services relating to insurancelinked and alternative risk financing transactions also in the united states marsh uses the services of nia securities llc a us registered brokerdealer and investment adviser guy carpenter provides advice on securities or investments in the european union through mmc securities europe limited which is authorized and regulated by the fsa marsh also receives investment management services in the european union from marsh investment services limited which is also regulated by the fsa mmc securities corp mmc securities europe limited nia securities llc and marsh investment services limited are indirect whollyowned subsidiaries of marsh  mclennan companies inc

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information presented in this report these risks have the potential to materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations or financial condition 

risks relating to the company generally 

legal and regulatory issues 

we are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from “errors and omissions” claims 

our operating companies provide numerous professional services including the placement of insurance and the provision of consulting actuarial and other services for corporate and public clients around the world as a result of these activities the company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of errors and omissions or “eo” claims particularly in our marsh and mercer businesses in our risk and insurance services segment such claims include allegations of damages arising from our failure to adequately place coverage or notify insurers of potential claims on behalf of clients in our consulting segment such claims include allegations of damages arising from our actuarial consulting pension administration and other services which frequently involve 1 assumptions and estimates concerning future events 2 complex drafting and interpretation of documentation governing pension plans and 3 calculating benefits within complicated pension structures given the longtail nature of professional liability claims eo matters often relate to services provided by the company dating back many years in each of our segments eo claims seek damages including punitive and treble damages in amounts that could if awarded be significant and subject us to potential liability for monetary damages negative publicity reputational harm and to diversion of personnel and management resources 

in establishing liabilities for errors and omissions claims in accordance with fasb asc subtopic no 45020 contingencies—loss contingencies the company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel an internal actuarial analysis and other analysis to estimate potential losses a liability is 

  12   

established when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable the liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable nevertheless given the unpredictability of eo claims and of litigation that could flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the company’s businesses results of operations financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period 

to the extent that expected losses exceed our deductible in any policy year the company also records an asset for the amount that we expect to recover under any available thirdparty insurance programs the company has varying levels of thirdparty insurance coverage with policy limits and coverage terms varying significantly by policy year 

further as more fully described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item 8 of this report we are subject to legal proceedings regulatory investigations and other contingencies other than eo claims which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable us federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states and its various states the european union and its member states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate for example we are subject to regulation by foreign and domestic governments regulatory agencies such as the sec in the united states and the fsa in the united kingdom and selfregulatory organizations 

such as finra as described further above under part i item 1 — business regulation of this report compliance with foreign and us laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions these laws and regulations include import and export requirements anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010 local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials as well as various trade sanctions laws such as the various international legislative and regulatory requirements relating to trade with iran 

as a publiclytraded company we are subject to additional federal state and other rules and regulations including those required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act compliance with the requirements of these laws and regulations may be costly and adversely affect our business 

while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we our employees our consultants or our contractors are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations including those referred to above we may be subject to investigations criminal sanctions or civil remedies including fines injunctions loss of an operating license or approval increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in a particular business or redress to clients the cost of compliance or the consequences of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations or financial condition in addition these matters could have a material adverse effect on the company by exposing us to negative publicity reputational damage or harm to our client or employee relationships 

in most jurisdictions government regulatory authorities have the power to interpret or amend applicable laws and regulations and have discretion to grant renew and revoke various licenses and approvals we need to conduct our activities such authorities may require the company to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations in some areas of our businesses we act on the basis of our own or the industry’s interpretations of applicable laws or regulations which may conflict from state to state or country to country in the event those interpretations eventually prove different from those of regulatory authorities we might be penalized or precluded from carrying on our previous activities 

  13   

moreover the laws and regulations to which we are subject may conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to generate additional revenue streams or enhance revenue streams any significant impairment of our ability to conduct our business as we historically have done could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

finally government involvement in the insurance or reinsurance markets could displace insurance or reinsurance currently available from the private market and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation 

in many jurisdictions we may have certain obligations to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal information of our employees our individual customers and our clients’ employees and retirement and other benefit plan participants we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information nonetheless we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personal information such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts as well as laws and regulations resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

further data privacy is subject to frequently changing laws rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate our failure to adhere to or successfully implement 

processes in response to changing legal or regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace as well as the general risks described above relating to our compliance systems and controls 

financial risks 

our pension obligations may cause the company’s earnings and cash flows to fluctuate 

volatility in global equity and bond markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the companys pension trust assets as well as estimated future pension liabilities as a result the companys financial results in any period could be negatively impacted in addition in a period of an extended financial market downturn the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the companys financial flexibility 

the company has significant pension obligations to its current and former employees totaling approximately 12 billion at december 31 2011 given the magnitude of our worldwide pension plans our earnings and cash flows are comparatively sensitive to factors such as equity and bond market returns as well as the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities rates of inflation and mortality assumptions in accordance with asc topic no 715 the company reflects the over or underfunded amount of its pension plans as assets or liabilities respectively variations in any of the preceding factors could cause significant fluctuation in our earnings as well as our shareholders equity from year to year and may result in increased levels of contributions to our pension plans 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity 

global economic and political conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve in 2008 and 2009 the credit markets and the financial services industry experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy failure collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states and foreign governments these economic conditions have resulted in negative impacts on businesses and financial institutions and financial services entities in particular the global economic crisis has had a significant effect on our consulting segment in particular many of our clients have been reducing expenses including amounts they spend on consulting services if these economic conditions persist or deteriorate they could potentially have a significant impact on our operations 

these economic conditions may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing of those services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages and this 

  14   

could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain should it become necessary for us to further restructure our business including reducing our work force as a result of these market conditions or other factors that reduce the demand for our products and services our ability to execute our business strategy could be adversely affected 

financial institution failures may cause us to incur increased expenses or make it more difficult either to utilize our existing debt capacity or otherwise obtain financing for our operations investing activities including the financing of any future acquisitions or financing activities 

our cash investments including those held in a fiduciary capacity are subject to general credit liquidity counterparty market and interest rate risks that may be exacerbated by the difficulties faced by financial institution counterparties if the banking system or the fixed income credit or equity markets deteriorate further or remain volatile the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected 

concerns regarding the european debt crisis and market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro could adversely affect the companys operating results as well as the value of the companys eurodenominated assets 

concerns persist regarding the ability of certain eurozone countries to service their debt obligations as a result a number of these countries have undertaken a variety of actions such as cutting spending and raising taxes designed to ease their future debt burdens a potential consequence may be stagnant growth or even recession in the eurozone economies and beyond also the stability of the euro and its viability as a single currency is being called into question in the future certain countries may find it advantageous to leave the eurozone and reintroduce their local currencies to retain better control over their economic situations a more extreme outcome is the complete dissolution of the euro any of these developments could lead to further contraction in the eurozone economies adversely affecting our operating results in the region the company may also face increased credit risk as our clients and financial institution counterparties in the region find themselves with reduced resources to meet their obligations finally the value of the companys assets held in the eurozone including cash holdings will decline if the currency devalues 

credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk 

currently the companys senior debt is rated baa2 by moodys and bbb by sp these ratings are the nexttolowest investment grade rating for moodys and the lowest investmentgrade rating for sp ratings from both sp and moodys currently carry a stable outlook 

if we need to raise capital in the future for example in order to fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives a credit rating downgrade would increase our financing costs and could limit our access to financing sources further we believe that a downgrade to a rating below investmentgrade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures 

our significant nonus operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business 

we are subject to exchange rate risk because some of our subsidiaries receive revenue other than in their functional currencies and because we must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in certain jurisdictions however our risk and insurance services operations generate revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in local currency due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we are subject to economic exposure as well as currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations exchange rate risk could have a significant impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

increased counterparty risk and changes in interest rates could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and adversely affect our financial results 

during times of stress in the banking industry counterparty risk can quickly escalate potentially resulting in substantial trading and investment losses for corporate and other investors in addition we may incur 

  15   

investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may continue to experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain low 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

the company is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to stockholders and for corporate expenses in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and other payments to the company we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on common stock 

further the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the us since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are made from the us it is important to be able to access cash generated outside the us funds from the companys operating subsidiaries outside of the us are periodically repatriated to the us via shareholder distributions and intercompany financings a number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive including but not limited to foreign exchange rates and taxrelated costs 

in the event we are unable to generate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate 

international operations 

we are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations 

we do business worldwide in 2011 55 of the company’s total operating segment revenue was generated from operations outside the united states and over onehalf of our employees are located outside the united states we expect to expand our nonus operations further 

the geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal economic operational market compliance and reputational risks these include among others risks relating to 

   16   

 our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake hurricane terrorist attack pandemic security breach power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems would provide us with an important advantage nevertheless we could still experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations such as key executive officers or personnel 

our operations particularly within our consulting segment are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a 

significant disruptive effect on our operations we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario 

we regularly assess and take steps to improve upon our existing business continuity plans and key management succession however a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability 

competitive risks 

each of the company’s businesses operates in a highly competitive environment if we fail to compete effectively our business and results of operations will suffer 

as a global professional services firm the company experiences acute and continuous competition in each of its operating segments our ability to compete successfully depends on a variety of factors including our geographic reach the sophistication and quality of our services our pricing relative to competitors and our customers’ option to selfinsure or utilize internal resources instead of consultants if we are unable to respond successfully to the competition we face our business and results of operations will suffer in addition as a us corporation with significant operations throughout the world lower combined corporate tax rates in the countries where our competitors are located could impact our ability to compete with our peers abroad 

in our risk and insurance services segment we compete intensely against a wide range of other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a global regional national or local scale for both client business and employee talent we compete as well with insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or other market intermediaries and with various other companies that provide riskrelated services the above competition is intensified by an industry trend toward a “syndicated” or “distributed” approach to the purchase of insurance and reinsurance brokerage services whereby a client engages multiple brokers to service different portions of the client’s account 

in our consulting segment we compete for business and employee talent with numerous independent consulting firms and organizations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms around the world 

the loss of key professionals could hurt our ability to retain existing client revenues and generate revenues from new business 

  17   

across all of our businesses our personnel are crucial to developing and retaining the client relationships on which our revenues depend it is therefore very important for us to retain significant revenueproducing employees and the key managerial and other professionals who support them we face numerous challenges in this regard including 

 losing employees who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements which would adversely affect our results of operations in addition if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 

consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge 

or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business guy carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the marketplace 

our businesses face rapid technological changes and our failure to adequately anticipate or respond to these changes could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

to remain competitive in many of our business areas we must identify the most current technologies and methodologies and integrate them into our service offerings for example guy carpenter’s riskmodeling services are increasingly dependent on implementing advanced software and datacompilation tools and mercer’s ability to price its outsourcing services competitively is highly dependent on the efficient and cost effective use of technology if we do not make the correct technology choices or investments or if our choices or investments are insufficiently prompt or costeffective our business and results of operations could suffer 

acquisitions and dispositions 

we face risks when we acquire and dispose of businesses 

we have a history of making acquisitions including a total of 38 acquisitions in the period 20082011 for aggregate purchase consideration of 15 billion in addition to marshs acquisition of the brokerage operations of alexander forbes in south africa botswana and namibia described more fully herein we have also exited various businesses including the sale of putnam investments trust “putnam” in august 2007 and the sale of kroll in the third quarter of 2010 we expect that acquisitions will continue to be a key part of our business strategy our success in this regard will depend on our ability to identify and compete for appropriate acquisition candidates and to complete with favorable results the transactions we decide to pursue 

while we intend that our acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability we cannot be certain that our past or future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations acquisitions involve special risks including accounting regulatory compliance information technology or human resources issues that could arise in connection with or as a result of the acquisition of the acquired company the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue profit or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect in addition if in the future the performance of our reporting units or an acquired business varies from our 

  18   

projections or assumptions or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units or an acquired business change the estimated fair value of our reporting units or an acquired business could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill and other acquisitionrelated intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet or in adjustments in contingent payment amounts as of december 31 2011 the company’s consolidated balance sheet reflected 70 billion of goodwill and intangible assets representing approximately 45 of the company’s total consolidated assets and allocated by reporting segment as follows risk and insurance services 48 billion and consulting 22 billion given the significant size of the company’s goodwill and intangible assets an impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given period 

when we dispose of businesses we are subject to the risk contractually agreed or otherwise of posttransaction liabilities for example as described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item 8 of this report we have retained certain contingent litigation liabilities relating to kroll 

risks relating to our risk and insurance services segment 

our risk and insurance services segment conducted through marsh and guy carpenter represented 54 of the company’s total operating segment revenue in 2011 our business in this segment is subject to particular risks 

results in our risk and insurance services segment may be adversely affected by a general decline in economic activity 

demand for many types of insurance and reinsurance generally rises and falls as economic growth expands or slows this dynamic affects the level of commissions and fees generated by marsh and guy carpenter to the extent our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions they may choose to limit their purchases of insurance and reinsurance coverage as applicable which would inhibit our ability to generate commission revenue and may decide not to purchase our risk advisory services which would inhibit our ability to generate fee revenue moreover insolvencies and combinations associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies and combinations in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business guy carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the market place 

volatility or declines in premiums and other market trends may significantly impede our ability to improve revenues and profitability 

a significant portion of our risk and insurance services revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to the general phenomenon of pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their riskprotection needs this trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to “selfinsure” the use of socalled “captive” insurers and the advent of capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance and reinsurance needs further the profitability of our risk and insurances services segment depends in part on ensuring that our professionals are compensated not only for insurance and reinsurance transactions but for the increasing analytical services and advice that we provide if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for all of our services our margins and profitability could suffer 

  19   

risks relating to our consulting segment 

our consulting segment conducted through mercer and oliver wyman group represented 46 of our total operating segment revenue in 2011 our businesses in this segment is subject to particular risks 

demand for our services might decrease for various reasons including a general economic downturn a decline in a client’s or an industry’s financial condition or changes in government regulation 

our consulting segment has historically achieved annual revenue growth despite this history however global economic conditions over the past several years have resulted in negative impacts on businesses and financial institutions many of our clients including financial institutions corporations governmental entities and pension plans have been reducing expenses including amounts spent on consulting services the evolving needs or financial circumstances of our clients may challenge our ability to increase revenues and profitability and reduce demand for our services if the economy or markets in which we operate experience continued weakness at current levels or deteriorate further our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition demand for many of mercer’s benefits services is affected by government regulation and tax rules which drive our clients’ needs for benefitsrelated services for example significant changes in government regulations affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of mercer’s services 

factors impacting defined benefit pension plans and the services we provide relating to those plans could adversely affect mercer 

mercer currently provides corporate multiemployer and public clients with actuarial consulting and administration services relating to defined benefit pension plans the nature of our work is complex our actuarial services involve numerous assumptions and estimates regarding future events including interest rates used to discount future liabilities estimated rates of return for a plans assets healthcare cost trends salary projections and participants life expectancies our consulting services involve complex drafting and interpretation of trust deeds and other documentation governing pension plans our administration services include calculating benefits within complicated pension structures clients dissatisfied with our services have brought and may bring significant claims against us particularly in the us and the uk in addition over the past several years the funded status of defined benefit pension plans has declined markedly a number of mercers clients have frozen or curtailed their defined benefit plans and moved to defined contribution plans resulting in reduced revenue for mercers retirement business these developments could adversely affect mercers business and operating results 

our profitability may suffer if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and pricing rates for our consultants 

the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on ensuring that our consultants maintain adequate utilization rates ie the percentage of our consultants’ working hours devoted to billable activities our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

   20   

other nonbillable activities 

 the factors listed above and therefore also our utilization rates for service personnel have been adversely affected by global economic conditions over the past several years if the utilization rate for our consulting professionals continues to decline our profit margin and profitability would suffer 

in addition the profitability of our consulting businesses depends on the prices we are able to charge for our services our pricing power is affected by a number of factors including 

 our pricing has also been adversely affected by global economic conditions over the past several years if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for our services our margins and profitability could suffer 

our quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly 

quarterly variations in revenues and operating results at mercer and oliver wyman group may occur due to several factors these include 

 a significant portion of total operating expenses at mercer and oliver wyman group is relatively fixed therefore a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results for these businesses 

  21   

if we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of client balances depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected

marsh and guy carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients andor commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided the particular insurer or reinsurer the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients revenues are affected by premium rate levels in the insurancereinsurance markets the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insuredsreinsureds in many cases fee compensation may be negotiated in advance based on the types and amounts of risks to be analyzed by the company and ultimately placed into the insurance market or retained by the client the trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next will therefore be affected by changes in premium rate levels fluctuations in client risk retention and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured as well as new and lost business and the volume of business from new and existing clients 

in march 2010 marsh announced its approach to market remuneration and contingent commissions in the us as previously announced marsh and mclennan agency and marsh’s affinity sponsored program and personal lines businesses accept contingent commissions marsh does not accept contingent commissions on any placement for any us clients served by the firm’s core brokerage operation marsh will continue to collect enhanced commissions with respect to its core brokerage operations which are fixed in advance of insurance transactions and are not related to volume retention growth or profitability

marsh and guy carpenter receive interest income on certain funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others the investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities these regulations typically provide for segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates both of which vary from time to time for presentation purposes fiduciary interest is segregated from the other revenues of marsh and guy carpenter and separately presented within the segment as shown in the revenue by segments charts earlier in this mda

corporate and other 

as discussed earlier in this document the runoff of the company’s involvement in the carg businesses is now managed by the company’s corporate departments and consequently the financial results of these businesses are included in “corporate” for segment reporting purposes

  37   

the following results of corporate and other includes the corporate advisory and restructuring operations 



corporate expenses in 2011 were 188 million compared to 172 million in 2010 the increase in corporate expense reflects higher compensation and pension costs primarily due to executive positions added in corporate and higher outside services costs related to corporate initiatives such as branding the carg amounts reflect payments received related to the carg businesses divested in 2008 

corporate expenses in 2010 were 172 million compared to 420 million in 2009 the decrease is due largely to the impact of a 230 million net charge incurred in 2009 related to the settlement of the securities and erisa class action lawsuits the decrease in corporate expense in 2010 compared to 2009 also reflects the impact of lower restructuring charges partly offset by higher consulting fees the increase in corporate advisory and restructuring in 2010 is due to the impact of 10 million of payments received in 2010 related to the disposal of this unit in 2008 compared with 1 million in 2009 these payments are classified as a recovery of expenses previously incurred as a result of the disposal transaction 

discontinued operations

 other corporate items 

interest 

interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to 28 million in 2011 compared with 20 million in 2010 the increase in interest income is due to the combined effect of higher average invested funds in 2011 and slightly higher average interest rates compared with the prior year interest expense was 199 million in 2011 compared with 233 million in 2010 the decrease is primarily due to the maturity of 550 million of senior notes in the third quarter of 2010 the early extinguishment of a portion of the companys outstanding notes during the third quarter of 2011 and a lower net interest rate on the companys debt subject to interest rate swaps these decreases are partly offset by interest on new senior notes issued during the third quarter of 2011 

interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to 20 million in 2010 compared with 17 million in 2009 the increase was primarily due to higher nonus interest rate yields in 2010 compared to 2009 interest expense was 233 million in 2010 compared with 241 million in 2009 the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the maturity of 550 million of senior notes in the third quarter of 2010 

early extinguishment of debt 

on july 15 2011 the company purchased 600 million of outstanding notes comprised of 330 million of its 2014 notes and 270 million of its 2015 notes collectively the notes the company acquired the notes at market value plus a tender premium which exceeded its carrying value and resulted in a charge of approximately 72 million in the third quarter of 2011 

investment income loss 

  39   

in 2011 investment income was 9 million compared with 43 million in 2010 this decrease primarily 

  40   

reflects the impact of lower private equity gains recorded in 2011 as compared to 2010 the effects of recording an impairment loss in 2011 and a gain on the sale of equity securities in 2010 

in 2010 investment income was 43 million compared with a loss of 2 million in 2009 the increase reflects the impact of marktomarket gains in 2010 on risk capital holdings’ private equity investments compared to losses in 2009 and gains realized from the sale of equity securities in 2010 

income taxes 

the companys consolidated effective tax rate in 2011 was 301 and in 2010 was 265 the tax rate in each year reflects foreign operations which are taxed at rates lower than the us statutory tax rate 

the companys consolidated effective tax rate in 2009 was 38 the tax rate reflects reductions relating to a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and the impact of foreign operations which are taxed at rates lower than the us statutory tax rate the decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulted from expiring statutes of limitations audit settlements and changes in estimates 

the lower effective tax rate attributed to the companys foreign operations primarily reflects lower corporate tax rates that prevail outside of the us net of the us tax impact from repatriating foreign earnings in 2011 pretax income in the uk canada australia and bermuda accounted for approximately 60 of the companys total nonus pretax income with effective rates in those countries of 25 29 31 and 0 respectively under current us tax law the company anticipates its nonus operations will continue to incur taxes at rates under the us federal tax rate of 35 

the companys nonus revenue over the past three years has been approximately 55 of total revenue while the pretax income from nonus locations varied from 91 to 179 of total pretax income although revenue in the united states has been approximately 45 of total revenue while the company had gains in its us operations in 2011 the company incurred pretax losses in the united states during 2010 and 2009 because significant charges from restructuring activities and certain litigation matters were disproportionately incurred there litigation related charges including legal fees resulted from the settlement of shareholder and erisa class actions in 2009 and the resolution of the alaska matter in 2010 all of which are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the company incurred gains in its us operations in 2011 

in addition as a us domiciled parent holding company marsh  mclennan companies inc is the issuer for essentially all of the companys external indebtedness and incurs the related interest expense in the us finally most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the us therefore the associated costs are incurred primarily in the united states 

the effective tax rate is expected to remain significantly variable for the foreseeable future it is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of the companys earnings which may result in higher or lower tax rates a proportional increase in us pretax income will tend to increase the effective tax rate because us federal and state corporate tax rates substantially exceed tax rates applicable outside the us losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax assets the tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation 

the realization of deferred tax assets depends on generating future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable the company and marsh have been profitable globally however tax liabilities are determined and assessed on a legal entity and jurisdictional basis certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings in the united states certain groups within the company which file on a combined basis were profitable in 2011 but incurred losses in 2009 and 2010 and an entity within marshs operations which files on a separate entity basis incurred a loss in 2009 the company assessed the realizability of its domestic deferred tax assets particularly state deferred tax assets of marsh relating to jurisdictions in which it files separate tax returns state deferred tax assets of all of the company domestic operations related to jurisdictions in which the company files a unitary or combined state tax return and foreign tax credit carryforwards in the companys consolidated us federal tax return when making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at december 31 2011 the company considered all available evidence placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified the evidence considered included 

  41   

i the profitability of the companys us operations in 2011 ii the nature frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses iii actions completed that are designed to reduce capacity and adjust to lower demand in the current economic environment iv profit trends evidenced by continued improvements in the companys and marshs operating performance v the nonrecurring nature of some of the items that contributed to the losses vi the carryforward periods for the net operating losses nols and foreign tax credit carryforwards vii the sources and timing of future taxable income giving weight to sources according to the extent to which they can be objectively verified and viii tax planning strategies that would be implemented if necessary to accelerate utilization of nols based on its assessment the company concluded that it is more likely than not that a substantial portion of these deferred tax assets are realizable and a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce the domestic tax assets to the amount that the company believes is more likely than not to be realized in the event sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods additional valuation allowances of up to approximately 240 million could be required relating to these domestic deferred tax assets the realization of the remaining us federal deferred tax assets is not as sensitive to us profits because it is supported by anticipated repatriation of future annual earnings from the companys profitable global operations consistent with the companys historical practice in addition when making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at december 31 2011 the company continued to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets of certain other entities with a history of recent losses including other us entities that file separate state tax returns and foreign subsidiaries and recorded valuation allowances as appropriate 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate for example proposals for fundamental us international tax reform if enacted could have a significant adverse impact on the effective tax rate 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of its own the company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to meet its obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to stockholders and for corporate expenses other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows 

the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the united states funds from the company’s operating subsidiaries located outside of the united states are regularly repatriated to the united states out of annual earnings at december 31 2011 the company had approximately 15 billion of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations of which all but approximately 82 million is considered to be permanently invested in those operations to fund foreign investments and working capital needs the company expects to continue its practice of repatriating foreign funds out of annual earnings while management does not foresee a need to repatriate the funds which are currently deemed permanently invested if facts or circumstances change management could elect to repatriate them if necessary which could result in higher effective tax rates in the future 

cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the company 

operating cash flows 

the company generated 17 billion of cash from operations in 2011 compared with 722 million in 2010 these amounts reflect the net income reported by the company during those periods excluding gains or losses from investments and the disposition of businesses adjusted for noncash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets cash generated from the disposition of businesses is included in investing cash flows 

the company received 322 million in cash refunds of us federal income taxes during the second quarter of 2011 comprising 212 million from carrying back the net capital loss incurred in 2010 from the 

  42   

sale of kroll and various other assets and 110 million from the cash settlement of the irs audit for the periods 2006 through 2008 the audit settlement primarily reflected the allowance of carry back claims for net operating losses and excess foreign tax credits arising in 2008 the impact on the tax provision of these events was reflected in prior periods and did not impact income tax expense reported in 2011 

on june 11 2010 the company resolved the litigation brought by the armb on behalf of two alaska benefit plans against mercer relating to work in the period 1992 to 2004 under the terms of the settlement agreement mercer paid 500 million of which 100 million was covered by insurance 

pension related items 

during 2011 the company contributed 24 million to its us pension plans and 320 million to nonus pension plans compared with 221 million for us plans and 237 million for nonus plans in 2010 

on january 3 2012 the company contributed 100 million to its us qualified plan the company’s expected funding for its us and nonus pension plans for the remainder of 2012 is approximately 24 million and 395 million respectively the company’s policy for funding its taxqualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable laws of other jurisdictions there currently is no erisa funding requirement for the us qualified plan for 2011 or 2012 funding requirements for nonus plans vary by country 

contribution rates are determined by the local actuaries based on local funding practices and statutory requirements which may differ from measurements under us gaap funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in addition amounts funded in the future to the extent not due under regulatory requirements may be affected by alternative uses of the company’s cash flows including dividends investments and share repurchases 

pension liabilities are impacted by among other things the discount rate set as of yearend in addition the yearoveryear change in the funded status of the plans is impacted by the variance between actual and assumed results particularly with regard to return on assets and changes in the discount rate as well as the amount of company contributions if any unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately 17 billion and 30 billion at december 31 2011 for the us plans and nonus plans respectively compared with 13 billion and 23 billion at december 31 2010 the increase is primarily due to the impact of decreases in the discount rates as well as actual returns in 2011 that were lower than the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets in the past several years the amount of actuarial losses has been significantly impacted both positively and negatively by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities declined in both the us and the uk our two largest plans in each of the three years for 2009 to 2011 at the end of 2009 the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 60 declining to 56 and 49 at the end of 2010 and 2011 respectively a decline in the discount rate increases the measured plan liability resulting in actuarial losses during 2011 the companys defined benefit pension plan assets had actual returns of 58 and 48 in the us and uk respectively during 2010 the actual returns were 144 in the us and 135 in the uk and in 2009 were 126 and 148 in the us and uk respectively in 2011 both the decline in the discount rate and actual asset returns that were lower than the assumed rates of return contributed to the actuarial losses in 2010 and 2009 actuarial losses resulting from declines in the discount rate were partly offset by actual asset returns which exceeded the assumed rates of return in each year 

overall the company’s pension expense is expected to increase in 2012 by approximately 30 million before the partlyoffsetting impacts on bonuses and other incentive compensation and possible movements in foreign exchange rates the increase in the expected pension expense in 2012 results primarily from a decline in the discount rates used to measure plan liabilities which has the effect of increasing pension expense and the impact of a lower assumed rate of return on assets in the uk partly offset by lower amortization of actuarial losses reflecting the fact that substantially all the participants in a uk plan which has been closed to new entrants for more than ten years are now inactive

management’s discussion of critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from those estimates 

legal and other loss contingencies 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions gaap requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable significant management judgement is required to apply this guidance the company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel an internal actuarial analysis and other analysis to estimate potential losses the liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable given the unpredictability of eo claims and of litigation that could flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the company’s businesses results of operations financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period 

in addition to the extent that insurance coverage is available significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the company’s various insurance programs 

retirement benefits 

the company maintains qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible us employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible nonus employees the company’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable foreign laws 

the company recognizes the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” net of tax in the company’s consolidated balance sheets these gains and losses are amortized prospectively out of aoci over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees or for plans in which substantially all the participants are inactive over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive employees 

the determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and assumed rate of salary increase significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements the company believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate actuarial 

  46   

assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate based on its current assumptions the company expects pension expense in 2012 to increase approximately 30 million compared with 2011 before partlyoffsetting impacts of bonuses and other incentive compensation and possible movements in foreign exchange rates 

future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions future investment performance future assumptions and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans holding all other assumptions constant a halfpercentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the us and uk plans which together comprise approximately 87 of total pension plan liabilities as follows 



changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense because the longterm rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic pension cost 

the company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees the cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the us is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire but is funded by the company as incurred the key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the company tax rate reflects its income statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions the company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the evaluation of a tax position is a twostep process the first step involves recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on only the technical merits of the position the technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes legislative intent regulations rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 

uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue 

tax law requires items be included in the companys tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which a deduction has been taken

item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk and credit risk 

certain of the company’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets 

interest rate risk and credit risk 

the company has historically managed its net exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing a mixture of variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance the company’s asset base in february 2011 the company entered into two 35year interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of the first 250 million of its 5375 senior notes due in 2014 under the terms of the swaps the counterparties will pay the company a fixed rate of 5375 and the company will pay interest at a floating rate of threemonth libor plus a fixed spread of 3726 the swaps are designated as fair value hedging instruments and are deemed to be perfectly effective in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 

interest income generated from the company’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates 

the company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates   



based on the above balances if shortterm interest rates increased or decreased by 10 or 12 basis points over the course of the year annual interest income including interest earned on fiduciary funds would increase or decrease by approximately 5 million 

in addition to interest rate risk our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counterparty credit risk to minimize this risk the company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a board approved investment policy the policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counterparty limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment the company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions the majority of cash and fiduciary fund investments are invested in shortterm bank deposits and liquid money market funds 

foreign currency risk 

the translated values of revenue and expense from the company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates the nonus based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 55 of total revenue we periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business although the company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location as such the us dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the us dollar generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk the company estimates that a 10 movement of major foreign currencies euro sterling australian dollar and canadian dollar in the same direction against the us dollar that held constant over the course of the year would increase or decrease full year net operating income by approximately 50 million 

  50   

equity price risk 

the company holds investments in both public and private companies certain private equity funds managed by stone point capital as well as two private equity funds managed by companies unrelated to stone point capital that invests primarily in financial services companies publicly traded investments of 20 million are classified as available for sale nonpublicly traded investments of 37 million are accounted for using the cost method and 119 million are accounted for using the equity method the investments that are classified as available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of changes in market value which if determined to be other than temporary could result in realized impairment losses the company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements

regulation 

the company’s activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under united states federal and state laws as well as laws of other countries in which the company’s subsidiaries operate see part i item 1a “risk factors” below for a discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our businesses 

risk and insurance services  while laws and regulations vary from location to location every state of the united states and most foreign jurisdictions require insurance market intermediaries and related service providers such as insurance brokers agents and consultants reinsurance brokers managing general agents and third party administrators to hold an individual andor company license from a governmental agency or selfregulatory organization some jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locallyowned business entities in this case if the company has no licensed subsidiary we may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction such arrangements are only permitted following an extensive review process 

  

beginning in january 2005 all european union member states were required to implement the insurance mediation directive this directive aims to apply consistent minimum professional standards to insurance and reinsurance intermediaries including a licensing system based on an assessment of factors such as professional competence financial capacity and professional indemnity insurance the adoption by member states of the european union of regulations to comply with the directive has led our insurance intermediary operations in the european union to become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements in january 2005 as part of the implementation of the directive in the united kingdom the power and responsibilities of the financial services authority or fsa were expanded to include regulation of insurance and reinsurance intermediaries in the united kingdom 

insurance authorities in the united states and certain other jurisdictions in which the company’s subsidiaries do business including the fsa in the united kingdom also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others these laws and regulations typically provide for segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information presented in this report these risks have the potential to materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations or financial condition 

risks relating to the company generally 

legal and regulatory issues 

we are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from “errors and omissions” claims 

our operating companies provide numerous professional services including the placement of insurance and the provision of consulting actuarial and other services for corporate and public clients around the world as a result of these activities the company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of errors and omissions or “eo” claims particularly in our marsh and mercer businesses in our risk and insurance services segment such claims include allegations of damages arising from our failure to adequately place coverage or notify insurers of potential claims on behalf of clients in our consulting segment such claims include allegations of damages arising from our consulting actuarial and other services which frequently involve assumptions and estimates concerning future events given the longtail nature of professional liability claims eo matters often relate to services provided by the company dating back many years in each of our segments eo claims seek damages including punitive and treble damages in amounts that could if awarded be significant and subject us to potential liability for monetary damages negative publicity reputational harm and to diversion of personnel and management resources 

in establishing liabilities for errors and omissions claims in accordance with fasb asc subtopic no 45020 contingencies—loss contingencies the company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel and an internal actuarial analysis to estimate potential losses a liability is established when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable the liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases the company has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because we are unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable nevertheless given the unpredictability of eo claims and of litigation that could flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the company’s businesses results of operations financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period 

to the extent that expected losses exceed our deductible in any policy year the company also records an asset for the amount that we expect to recover under any available thirdparty insurance programs the company has varying levels of thirdparty insurance coverage with policy limits and coverage terms varying significantly by policy year the company is not aware of coverage defenses or other obstacles to coverage that would limit recoveries through policy year 20012002 in a material amount beginning in 2002 the availability of thirdparty insurance has declined 

further as more fully described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item 8 of this report we are subject to legal proceedings regulatory investigations and other contingencies other than eo claims which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable us federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states and its various states the european union and its member states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate for example we are subject to regulation by foreign and domestic governments regulatory agencies such as the sec in the united states and the fsa in the united kingdom and selfregulatory organizations 

  

such as finra as described further above under part i item 1 — business regulation of this report compliance with foreign and us laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions these laws and regulations include import and export requirements anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the pending antibribery law in the uk local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials as well as various trade sanctions laws such as the various international legislative and regulatory requirements relating to trade with iran 

as a publiclytraded company we are subject to additional federal state and other rules and regulations including those required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the recently adopted doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act which will subject us to significant additional executive compensation and corporate governance requirements many of which have yet to be implemented by the sec compliance with the requirements of these laws and regulations may be costly and adversely affect our business 

while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we our employees our consultants or our contractors are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations including those referred to above we may be subject to investigations criminal sanctions or civil remedies including fines injunctions loss of an operating license or approval increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in a particular business or redress to clients the cost of compliance or the consequences of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations or financial condition in addition these matters could have a material adverse effect on the company by exposing us to negative publicity reputational damage or harm to our client or employee relationships 

in most jurisdictions government regulatory authorities have the power to interpret or amend applicable laws and regulations and have discretion to grant renew and revoke various licenses and approvals we need to conduct our activities such authorities may require the company to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations in some areas of our businesses we act on the basis of our own or the industry’s interpretations of applicable laws or regulations which may conflict from state to state or country to country in the event those interpretations eventually prove different from those of regulatory authorities we might be penalized or precluded from carrying on our previous activities moreover the laws and regulations to which we are subject may conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate recent changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to generate additional revenue streams or enhance revenue streams any significant impairment of our ability to conduct our business as we historically have done could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

finally government involvement in the insurance or reinsurance markets could displace insurance or reinsurance currently available from the private market and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation 

in many jurisdictions we may have certain obligations to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal information of our employees our individual customers and our clients’ employees and retirement and other benefit plan participants we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information nonetheless we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personal information such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts as well as laws and regulations resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

further data privacy is subject to frequently changing laws rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate our failure to adhere to or successfully implement 

  

processes in response to changing legal or regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace as well as the general risks described above relating to our compliance systems and controls 

financial risks 

our pension obligations may cause the company’s earnings and cash flows to fluctuate 

volatility in equity and bond market conditions may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company’s pension trust assets and estimated future pension liabilities as a result the company’s financial results in any period could be negatively impacted in addition in a period of an extended financial market downturn the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company’s financial flexibility 

the company has significant pension obligations to its current and former employees totaling approximately 11 billion at december 31 2010 the magnitude of our worldwide pension plans means that our earnings and the funded status of our pension plans are comparatively sensitive to factors such as equity and bond market returns as well as the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities rates of inflation and mortality assumptions in accordance with asc topic no 715 the company reflects the over or underfunded amount of its pension plans as assets or liabilities respectively variations in any of the preceding factors could cause significant fluctuation in our earnings as well as our shareholder’s equity from year to year and may result in increased levels of contributions to our pension plans 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity 

global economic and political conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve in 2008 and 2009 the credit markets and the financial services industry experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy failure collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states and foreign governments these economic conditions have resulted in negative impacts on businesses and financial institutions and financial services entities in particular the global economic crisis has had a significant effect on our consulting segment in particular many of our clients have been reducing expenses including amounts they spend on consulting services if these economic conditions persist or deteriorate they could potentially have a significant impact on our operations 

these economic conditions may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing of those services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain should it become necessary for us to further restructure our business including reducing our work force as a result of these market conditions or other factors that reduce the demand for our products and services our ability to execute our business strategy could be adversely affected 

financial institution failures may cause us to incur increased expenses or make it more difficult either to utilize our existing debt capacity or otherwise obtain financing for our operations investing activities including the financing of any future acquisitions or financing activities 

our cash investments including those held in a fiduciary capacity are subject to general credit liquidity counterparty market and interest rate risks that may be exacerbated by the recent global financial crisis if the banking system or the fixed income credit or equity markets deteriorate further or remain volatile the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected 

  

credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk 

both moody’s and standard  poor’s downgraded the company’s senior debt credit rating in late 2004 and sp announced a further downgrade in december 2007 currently the company’s senior debt is rated baa2 by moody’s and bbb by sp these ratings are the nexttolowest investment grade rating for moody’s and the lowest investmentgrade rating for sp 

if we need to raise capital in the future for example in order to fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives any further credit rating downgrade would increase our financing costs and could limit our access to financing sources further we believe that a downgrade to a rating below investmentgrade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures 

our significant nonus operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business 

we are subject to exchange rate risk because some of our subsidiaries receive revenue other than in their functional currencies and because we must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in certain jurisdictions however our risk and insurance services operations generate revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in local currency due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we are subject to economic exposure as well as currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations exchange rate risk could have a significant impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

increased counterparty risk and changes in interest rates could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and adversely affect our financial results 

as was evident in the recent financial crisis counterparty risk can quickly escalate resulting in substantial trading and investment losses for corporate and other investors in addition we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may continue to experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain low 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

the company is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to stockholders and for corporate expenses in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and other payments to the company we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on common stock 

further the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the us since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are made from the us it is important to be able to access cash generated outside the us funds from the company’s operating subsidiaries outside of the us are periodically repatriated to the us via shareholder distributions and repayment of intercompany financing a number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive including but not limited to foreign exchange rates and taxrelated costs 

in the event we are unable to generate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate 

  

international operations 

we are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations 

we do business worldwide in 2010 56 percent of the company’s total operating segment revenue was generated from operations outside the united states and over onehalf of our employees are located outside the united states we expect to expand our nonus operations further 

the geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal economic operational market compliance and reputational risks these include among others risks relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake hurricane terrorist attack pandemic security breach power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems would provide us with an important advantage nevertheless we could still experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations such as key executive officers or personnel 

our operations particularly within our consulting segment are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a 

  

significant disruptive effect on our operations we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario 

we regularly assess and take steps to improve upon our existing business continuity plans and key management succession however a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability 

competitive risks 

each of the company’s businesses operates in a highly competitive environment if we fail to compete effectively our business and results of operations will suffer 

as a global professional services firm the company experiences acute and continuous competition in each of its operating segments our ability to compete successfully depends on a variety of factors including our geographic reach the sophistication and quality of our services our pricing relative to competitors and our customers’ option to selfinsure or utilize internal resources instead of consultants if we are unable to respond successfully to the competition we face our business and results of operations will suffer 

in our risk and insurance services segment we compete intensely against a wide range of other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a global regional national or local scale for both client business and employee talent we compete as well with insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or other market intermediaries and with various other companies that provide riskrelated services the above competition is intensified by an industry trend toward a “syndicated” or “distributed” approach to the purchase of insurance and reinsurance brokerage services whereby a client engages multiple brokers to service different portions of the client’s account 

in our consulting segment we compete for business and employee talent with numerous independent consulting firms and organizations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms around the world 

the loss of key professionals could hurt our ability to retain existing client revenues and generate revenues from new business 

across all of our businesses our personnel are crucial to developing and retaining the client relationships on which our revenues depend it is therefore very important for us to retain significant revenueproducing employees and the key managerial and other professionals who support them we face numerous challenges in this regard including 

 

  

  

 losing employees who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements which would adversely affect our results of operations in addition if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 

consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge 

  

or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business guy carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the marketplace 

our businesses face rapid technological changes and our failure to adequately anticipate or respond to these changes could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

to remain competitive in many of our business areas we must identify the most current technologies and methodologies and integrate them into our service offerings for example guy carpenter’s riskmodeling services are increasingly dependent on implementing advanced software and datacompilation tools and mercer’s ability to price its outsourcing services competitively is highly dependent on the efficient and cost effective use of technology if we do not make the correct technology choices or investments or if our choices or investments are insufficiently prompt or costeffective our business and results of operations could suffer 

acquisitions and dispositions 

we face risks when we acquire and dispose of businesses 

we have a history of making acquisitions including a total of 26 acquisitions in the period 20082010 for aggregate purchase consideration of 13 billion we have also exited various businesses including the sale of putnam investments trust “putnam” in august 2007 and the sale of kroll in the third quarter of 2010 we expect that acquisitions will continue to be a key part of our business strategy our success in this regard will depend on our ability to identify and compete for appropriate acquisition candidates and to complete with favorable results the transactions we decide to pursue 

while we intend that our acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability we cannot be certain that our past or future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations acquisitions involve special risks including accounting regulatory compliance information technology or human resources issues that could arise in connection with or as a result of the acquisition of the acquired company the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue profit or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect in addition if in the future the performance of our reporting units or an acquired business varies from our projections or assumptions or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units or an acquired business change the estimated fair value of our reporting units or an acquired business could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill and other acquisitionrelated intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet or in adjustments in contingent payment amounts given the significant size of the company’s goodwill and intangible assets a writedown of this sort could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given period as of december 31 2010 the company’s consolidated balance sheet reflected 68 billion of goodwill and intangible assets representing approximately 45 percent of the company’s total consolidated assets and allocated by reporting segment as follows risk and insurance services 47 billion and consulting 21 billion 

when we dispose of businesses we are subject to the risk contractually agreed or otherwise of posttransaction liabilities for example as described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item 8 of this report we have retained certain contingent litigation liabilities relating to putnam and kroll 

risks relating to our risk and insurance services segment 

our risk and insurance services segment conducted through marsh and guy carpenter represented 54 percent of the company’s total operating segment revenue in 2010 our business in this segment is subject to particular risks 

  

results in our risk and insurance services segment may be adversely affected by a general decline in economic activity 

demand for many types of insurance and reinsurance generally rises and falls as economic growth expands or slows this dynamic affects the level of commissions and fees generated by marsh and guy carpenter to the extent our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions they may choose to limit their purchases of insurance and reinsurance coverage as applicable which would inhibit our ability to generate commission revenue and may decide not to purchase our risk advisory services which would inhibit our ability to generate fee revenue moreover insolvencies and combinations associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies and combinations in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business guy carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the market place 

volatility or declines in premiums and other market trends may significantly impede our ability to improve revenues and profitability 

a significant portion of our risk and insurance services revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to the general phenomenon of pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their riskprotection needs this trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to “selfinsure” the use of socalled “captive” insurers and the advent of capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance and reinsurance needs further the profitability of our risk and insurances services segment depends in part on ensuring that our professionals are compensated not only for insurance and reinsurance transactions but for the increasing analytical services and advice that we provide if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for all of our services our margins and profitability could suffer 

risks relating to our consulting segment 

our consulting segment conducted through mercer and oliver wyman group represented 46 percent of our total operating segment revenue in 2010 our businesses in this segment is subject to particular risks 

demand for our services might decrease for various reasons including a general economic downturn a decline in a client’s or an industry’s financial condition or changes in government regulation 

our consulting segment has historically achieved significant annual revenue growth despite this history however the recent global economic conditions have resulted in negative impacts on businesses and financial institutions many of our clients including financial institutions corporations governmental entities and pension plans have been reducing expenses including amounts spent on consulting services the evolving needs or financial circumstances of our clients may challenge our ability to increase revenues and profitability and reduce demand for our services if the economy or markets in which we operate experience continued weakness at current levels or deteriorate further our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition demand for many of mercer’s benefits services is affected by government regulation and tax rules which drive our clients’ needs for benefitsrelated services for example significant changes in government regulations affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of mercer’s services 

  

factors impacting defined benefit pension plans could adversely affect mercer 

mercer currently provides corporate multiemployer and public clients with consulting and actuarial services relating to defined benefit pension plans the nature of our work particularly our actuarial services is complex and involves numerous assumptions and estimates regarding future events including interest rates used to discount future liabilities estimated rates of return for a plan’s assets healthcare cost trends or participants’ life expectancies clients dissatisfied with our services have brought and may bring claims against us in addition over the past several years the funded status of defined benefit pension plans has declined markedly a number of mercer’s clients have frozen or curtailed their defined benefit plans and moved to defined contribution plans resulting in reduced revenue for mercer’s retirement business these developments could adversely affect mercer’s business and operating results 

our profitability may suffer if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and pricing rates for our consultants 

the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on ensuring that our consultants maintain adequate utilization rates ie the percentage of our consultants’ working hours devoted to billable activities our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the factors listed above and therefore also our utilization rates for service personnel have been adversely affected by recent macroeconomic conditions if the utilization rate for our consulting professionals continues to decline our profit margin and profitability would suffer 

in addition the profitability of our consulting businesses depends on the prices we are able to charge for our services our pricing power is affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our pricing has also been adversely affected by the recent economic crisis if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for our services our margins and profitability could suffer 

  

our quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly 

quarterly variations in revenues and operating results at mercer and oliver wyman group may occur due to several factors these include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a significant portion of total operating expenses at mercer and oliver wyman group is relatively fixed therefore a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results for these businesses 

if we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us the increasing number of insolvencies in the current economic environment and the numerous bankruptcy laws to which they are subject could also adversely affect our ability to collect receivables or unbilled services timely collection of client balances depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected

interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to 20 million in 2010 compared with 17 million in 2009 the increase is primarily due to higher nonus interest rate yields in 2010 compared to 2009 interest expense was 233 million in 2010 compared with 241 million in 2009 the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the maturity of 550 million of senior notes in the third quarter of 2010 

interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to 17 million in 2009 compared with 47 million in 2008 the decrease in interest income is due to lower average interest rates in 2009 compared with the prior year interest expense of 241 million in 2009 increased 21 million from the prior year this increase is primarily due to the prefunding in the first quarter of the 400 million of senior notes that matured in june 2009 the higher interest rate on the new bonds compared with those that matured as well as higher interest expense associated with acquisition related liabilities the company used the proceeds of the newly issued senior notes to fund the maturity of 400 million of senior notes in june 2009 

  

investment income loss 

in 2010 investment income was 43 million compared with a loss of 2 million in 2009 the increase reflects the impact of marktomarket gains in 2010 on risk capital holdings’ private equity investments compared to losses in 2009 and gains realized from the sale of equity securities in 2010 

in 2009 investment losses were 2 million compared with a 12 million loss in the prior year the decrease reflects lower marktomarket declines on risk capital holdings’ private equity investments recorded in 2009 compared with 2008 and gains realized from the sale of equity securities in 2009 

income taxes 

the company’s consolidated effective tax rate in 2010 was 265 the tax rate reflects foreign operations taxed at rates lower than the us statutory tax rate 

the company’s consolidated effective tax rate in 2009 was 38 the tax rate reflects reductions relating to a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and foreign operations taxed at rates lower than the us statutory tax rate the decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulted from expiring statutes of limitations audit settlements and changes in estimates 

the company’s consolidated effective tax rate in 2008 was 229 the tax rate reflects foreign operations taxed at rates lower than the us rate it also reflects a federal benefit on deferred state taxes largely offset by other deferred tax adjustments 

the lower tax rate generally attributed to the company’s foreign operations reflects income taxed at rates lower than the 35 us federal tax rate net of the us tax impact of repatriation of foreign earnings the reduced effective tax rate primarily reflects lower corporate tax rates that prevail outside of the us enhanced by planning that further reduces the impact of taxes worldwide under current us tax law the company anticipates its nonus operations will continue to incur taxes at rates under 35 although the percentage impact on the tax rate is expected to moderate as increases in us pretax income change the geographic mix of income 

nevertheless the effective tax rate is expected to remain significantly variable for the foreseeable future the rate is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of the company’s earnings which may have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the rate this also could result in foreign tax credit carryforwards arising in future periods for which a valuation allowance may be required losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations and may require valuation allowances affecting the rate depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax assets the tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation 

the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable the company and marsh have been profitable globally however tax liabilities are determined and assessed on a legal entity and jurisdictional basis certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings in the united states certain groups within the company which file on a combined basis and certain entities within marsh’s operations which file on a separate entity basis incurred losses for the last two years as well as the current year the company assessed the realizability of its domestic deferred tax assets particularly state deferred tax assets of marsh relating to jurisdictions in which it files separate tax returns state deferred tax assets of all of the company domestic operations related to jurisdictions in which the company files a unitary or combined state tax return and foreign tax credit carryforwards in the company’s consolidated us federal tax return when making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at december 31 2010 the company considered all available evidence placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified the evidence considered included i the nature frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses ii actions completed that are designed to reduce capacity and adjust to lower demand in the current economic environment iii profit trends evidenced by recent improvements in the company’s and marsh’s operating performance iv the nonrecurring nature of some of the items 

  

that contributed to the losses v the carryforward periods for the net operating losses “nols” and foreign tax credit carryforwards vi the sources and timing of future taxable income giving weight to sources according to the extent to which they can be objectively verified and vii tax planning strategies that would be implemented if necessary to accelerate utilization of nols based on its assessment the company concluded that it is more likely than not that a substantial portion of these deferred tax assets are realizable and a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce the domestic tax assets to the amount that the company believes is more likely than not to be realized in the event sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods additional valuation allowances of up to approximately 250 million could be required relating to these domestic deferred tax assets the realization of the remaining us federal deferred tax assets is not as sensitive to us profits because it is supported by anticipated repatriation of future earnings from the company’s profitable global operations in addition when making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at december 31 2010 the company continued to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets of certain other entities with a history of recent losses including other us entities that file separate state tax returns and foreign subsidiaries and recorded valuation allowances as appropriate 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate for example proposals for fundamental us international tax reform such as the recent proposal by president obama’s administration if enacted could have a significant adverse impact on the effective tax rate 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s liquidity needs are primarily for operating expenses servicing debt funding pension obligations paying dividends on outstanding stock funding acquisitions and capital expenditures as a holding company the company’s primary source for meeting these requirements is cash flows from operating subsidiaries other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows 

cash on our consolidated balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheet as an offset to fiduciary liabilities fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the company 

operating cash flows 

the company generated 722 million of cash from operations in 2010 compared with 640 million in 2009 these amounts reflect the net income reported by the company during those periods excluding gains or losses from investments and the disposition of businesses adjusted for noncash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets cash generated from the disposition of businesses is included in investing cash flows in december 2009 the company paid 435 million into settlement funds related to the securities and erisa class action lawsuits described above through december 31 2009 the company had collected 163 million of the total 230 million recovery from its insurers and the remaining 67 million was collected in january 2010 

on june 11 2010 the company resolved the litigation brought by the alaska retirement management board “armb” on behalf of two alaska benefit plans against mercer relating to work in the period 1992 to 2004 under the terms of the settlement agreement mercer paid 500 million of which 100 million was covered by insurance the company recorded a tax benefit of 277 million related to the disposition of kroll and a 160 million tax benefit related to the cost of the alaska settlement approximately 50 million of the tax benefits related to the kroll disposition were realized during 2010 and approximately 230 million is expected to be realized in the first half of 2011

the company’s expected funding for its us nonqualified and nonus pension plans in 2011 is approximately 20 million and 300 million respectively the company’s policy for funding its taxqualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable foreign laws there currently is no erisa funding requirement for the us qualified plan for 2010 or 2011 funding requirements for nonus plans vary by country contribution rates are determined by the local actuaries based on local funding practices and statutory requirements which may differ from measurements under us gaap funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in addition amounts funded in the future to the extent not due under regulatory requirements may be affected by alternative uses of the company’s cash flows including dividends investments and share repurchases 

during 2010 the company’s defined benefit pension plan assets experienced investment gains of 144 in the us and 135 in the uk our largest plan 

pension liabilities are impacted by among other things the discount rate set as of yearend in addition the yearoveryear change in the funded status of the plans is impacted by the variance between actual and assumed results particularly with regard to return on assets and changes in the discount rate as well as the amount of company contributions if any unrecognized actuarial losses at december 31 2010 were approximately 13 billion for the us plans and 23 billion for the nonus plans over the past several years the amount of actuarial losses has been significantly impacted both positively and negatively by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates in 2008 severe downturns in the global equity markets resulted in market declines of 18 in the us and 14 in the uk our largest plan this was partly offset by asset returns which exceeded the assumed rates of return in 2009 and 2010 in both the us and the uk in addition the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities declined in the us in each of the last three years a decline in the discount rate increases the measured plan liability resulting in actuarial losses in the uk asset losses in 2008 were partly offset by an increase in the discount rate however the discount rate in the uk declined in each of the last two years 

overall the company’s pension expense is expected to increase in 2011 by approximately 60 million before the partlyoffsetting impacts on bonuses and other incentive compensation and possible movements in foreign exchange rates

market risk and credit risk 

certain of the company’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets 

interest rate risk and credit risk 

the company has historically managed its net exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing a mixture of variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance the company’s asset base during 2007 virtually all of the company’s variable rate borrowings were repaid in january 2011 the company entered into two 35 year interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of the first 250 million of its 5375 senior notes due in 2014 under the terms of the swap the counterparties will pay the company a fixed rate of 5375 and the company will pay interest at a floating rate of threemonth libor plus a fixed spread of 3726 the swaps are designated as fair value hedging instruments and are deemed to be perfectly effective in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 

interest income generated from the company’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates particularly shortterm interest rates 

the company had the following investments subject to variable interest rates 

 

   

these investments and debt instruments are discussed more fully in note1 to the consolidated financial statements appearing in item 8 of this report 

based on the above balances if shortterm interest rates increased or decreased by 10 or 13 basis points over the course of the year annual interest income including interest earned on fiduciary funds would increase or decrease by approximately 5 million 

in addition to interest rate risk our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counterparty credit risk to minimize this risk the company and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a boardapproved investment policy the policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counterparty limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment the company carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions the majority of cash and fiduciary funds are invested in shortterm bank deposits and liquid money market funds 

foreign currency risk 

the translated values of revenue and expense from the company’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates the nonus based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 56 of total revenue note 17 details revenue by geographic area we periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business although the company has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in most cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location as such the us dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the us dollar generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk the company estimates that a 10 movement of major foreign currencies euro sterling australian dollar and canadian dollar in the same direction against the us dollar that held constant over the course of the year would increase or decrease full year net operating income by approximately 50 million 

equity price risk 

the company holds investments in public and private companies as well as in certain private equity funds managed by stone point capital publicly traded investments of 23 million are classified as available for sale nonpublicly traded investments of 39 million are accounted for using the cost method and 168 million are accounted for using the equity method the investments that are classified as available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of changes in market value which if determined to be other than temporary could result in realized impairment losses the company periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements 

other 

a number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

management’s discussion of critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding the company’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from those estimates 

  

legal and other loss contingencies 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions gaap requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance the company analyzes its litigation exposure based on available information including consultation with internal and external counsel handling the defense of these matters to assess its potential liability 

in addition to the extent that insurance coverage is available significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the company’s various insurance programs 

retirement benefits 

the company maintains qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible us employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible nonus employees the company’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable foreign laws 

the company recognizes the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” net of tax in the company’s consolidated balance sheets 

the determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and assumed rate of salary increase significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements the company believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate actuarial assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate based on its current assumptions the company expects pension expense in 2011 to increase approximately 60 million compared with 2010 before partlyoffsetting impacts of bonuses and other incentive compensation and possible movements in foreign exchange rates 

future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions future investment performance future assumptions and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans holding all other assumptions constant a halfpercentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the us and uk plans which together comprise approximately 87 of total pension plan liabilities as follows 

 

 changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense because the longterm rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate 

the company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees the cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the us is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire but is funded by the company as incurred the key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

income taxes 

the company tax rate reflects its income statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions the company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the evaluation of a tax position is a twostep process the first step involves recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on only the technical merits of the position the technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes legislative intent regulations rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 

uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue 

tax law requires items be included in the company’s tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements in assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly the company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company also considers taxplanning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years if carryback is permitted under the appropriate tax law the underlying assumptions the company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the company’s recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carryforwards are deductible or creditable valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction 

fair value determinations 

investment valuation—the company holds investments in both public and private companies as well as certain private equity funds the majority of the public investments are accounted for as available for sale securities certain investments primarily investments in private equity funds are accounted for using the equity method although not directly recorded in the company’s consolidated balance sheets the company defined benefit pension plans hold investments of approximately 10 billion the fair value of these investments determines in part the overor underfunded status of those plans 

  

which is included in the company’s consolidated balance sheets the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements the company bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they relate to each investment fair value of investments in private equity funds is determined by the funds’ investment managers factors considered in determining the fair value of private equity investments include implied valuation of recently completed financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors performance multiples of comparable public companies restrictions on the sale or disposal of the investments trading characteristics of the securities and the relative size of the holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public market float in those instances where quoted market prices are not available particularly for equity holdings in private companies or formal restrictions limit the sale of securities significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate value of the company’s investments the company reviews with the fund manager the appropriateness of valuation results for significant private equity investments 

goodwill impairment testing—the company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred the company performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a market approach or a discounted cash flow model carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level the company performed interim goodwill impairment assessments in its risk consulting  technology segment which resulted in an impairment charge of 315 million recorded in the first quarter of 2009 and impairment charges totaling 540 million recorded in the first and second quarters of 2008 impairment charges included in discontinued operations were 315 million and 504 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively the risk consulting  technology segment was effectively disposed of with the sale of kroll in august of 2010 the company completed its 2010 annual review in the third quarter of 2010 and concluded that goodwill was not impaired the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin the fair value estimates used in this assessment are dependent upon assumptions and estimates about the future profitability and other financial ratios of our reporting units as well as relevant financial data recent transactions and market valuations of comparable public companies 

sharebased payment 

the guidance for accounting for sharebased payments requires among other things that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values in addition management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards as defined by the accounting guidance 

as of december 31 2010 there was 234 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards the weightedaverage periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 17 years also as of december 31 2010 there was 206 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the company’s restricted stock restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards

regulation 

mmc’s activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under united states federal and state laws as well as laws of other countries in which mmc’s subsidiaries 

  

operate see part i item 1a “risk factors” below for a discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our businesses 

risk and insurance services  while laws and regulations vary from location to location every state of the united states and most foreign jurisdictions require insurance market intermediaries and related service providers such as insurance brokers agents and consultants reinsurance brokers managing general agents and third party administrators to hold an individual andor company license from a governmental agency or selfregulatory organization some jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locallyowned business entities in this case if mmc has no licensed subsidiary we may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction such arrangements are only permitted following an extensive review process 

beginning in january 2005 all european union member states were required to implement the insurance mediation directive this directive aims to apply consistent minimum professional standards to insurance and reinsurance intermediaries including a licensing system based on an assessment of factors such as professional competence financial capacity and professional indemnity insurance the adoption by member states of the european union of regulations to comply with the directive has led our insurance intermediary operations in the european union to become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements in january 2005 as part of the implementation of the directive in the united kingdom the power and responsibilities of the financial services authority or fsa were expanded to include regulation of insurance and reinsurance intermediaries in the united kingdom 

insurance authorities in the united states and certain other jurisdictions in which mmc’s subsidiaries do business including the fsa in the united kingdom also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others these laws and regulations typically provide for segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them 

certain of mmc’s risk and insurance services activities are governed by other regulatory bodies such as investment securities and futures licensing authorities in the united states marsh and guy carpenter use the services of mmc securities corp a usregistered brokerdealer and investment advisor member finrasipc primarily in connection with investment bankingrelated services and advising on alternative risk financing transactions also in the united states marsh uses the services of interlink securities corp primarily in connection with variable insurance products for high net worth individuals guy carpenter provides advice on securities or investments in the european union through mmc securities europe ltd formerly gc securities ltd which is authorized and regulated by the fsa marsh receives investment management services in the european union from another mmc subsidiary marsh investment service limited which is also regulated by the fsa mmc securities corp interlink securities corp and mmc securities europe ltd are indirect whollyowned subsidiaries of mmc 

in some jurisdictions insurancerelated taxes may be due either directly from clients or from the insurance broker in the latter case the broker customarily looks to the client for payment 

consulting  certain of mercer’s retirementrelated consulting services are subject to pension law and financial regulation in many countries including by the securities and exchange commission or sec in the united states and the fsa in the united kingdom in addition the trustee services investment services including advice to individuals on the investment of personal pension assets and assumption of discretionary investment management responsibilities and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services provided by mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to investment and securities regulations in various jurisdictions the benefits insurance consulting and brokerage services provided by mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to the same licensing requirements and regulatory oversight as the insurance market intermediaries described above regarding our risk and insurance services businesses mercer and oliver wyman group use the services of mmc securities corp in the united states and mmc securities europe limited in the united kingdom and continental europe primarily in connection with the provision of certain retirement and employee benefit services and investment banking services respectively 

  

risk consulting  technology  certain of kroll’s risk consulting and investigative activities are licensed and regulated at the federal state and local level in the united states and abroad many of these activities also involve the use of data from outside sources including third party vendors and governmental records as a result changes in existing or the implementation of new laws and regulations particularly relating to privacy could interfere with kroll’s historical access to and use of such data 

competitive conditions 

mmc faces strong competition in all of its businesses from providers of similar products and services mmc also encounters strong competition throughout its businesses from both public corporations and private firms in attracting and retaining qualified employees in addition to the discussion below see “risks relating to mmc generally—competitive risks” in part i item 1a of this report 

risk and insurance services  mmc’s combined insurance and reinsurance services businesses are global in scope the principal bases upon which our insurance and reinsurance businesses compete include the range quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients mmc encounters strong competition from other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis from a large number of regional and local firms in the united states the european union and elsewhere from insurance and reinsurance companies that market distribute and service their insurance and reinsurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses including commercial and investment banks accounting firms and consultants that provide riskrelated services and products 

certain insureds and groups of insureds have established programs of self insurance including captive insurance companies as a supplement or alternative to thirdparty insurance thereby reducing in some cases their need for insurance placements there are also many other providers of affinity group and private client services including specialized firms insurance companies and other institutions 

the continuing impact of legal and regulatory proceedings concerning our insurance brokerage operations also could affect marsh’s competitive position these proceedings are discussed in more detail in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included under part ii item 8 of this report please also read our discussion of the risks associated with these proceedings and their impact under part i item 1a “risk factors” below 

consulting  mmc’s consulting and hr outsourcing businesses face strong competition from other privately and publicly held worldwide and national companies as well as regional and local firms these businesses compete generally on the basis of the range quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients competitors include independent consulting and outsourcing firms as well as consulting and outsourcing operations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms 

mercer’s investment consulting and investment management businesses face competition from many sources including multimanager services offered by other investment consulting firms and financial institutions 

in many cases clients have the option of handling the services provided by mercer and oliver wyman group internally without assistance from outside advisors 

risk consulting  technology  in risk consulting and technology mmc faces competition from local regional national and international firms that provide similar services in the fields of accounting investigative and security services consulting and technology services kroll’s consulting services group faces competition from local regional national and international consulting and accounting firms who provide forensic accounting litigation support and investigative services as well as other specialist firms providing architectural engineering and security consulting services kroll’s litigation support and data recovery and background screening businesses face competition from a variety of law firms independent service providers and technology companies

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information presented in this report these risks have the potential to materially adversely affect mmc’s business results of operations or financial condition 

risks relating to mmc generally 

legal and regulatory issues 

a lawsuit related to claims of professional negligence and fraud in providing actuarial services has been filed against mercer which may subject mercer to civil liabilities 

as more fully described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item 8 of this report mercer is exposed to potential liabilities arising out of a civil lawsuit against mercer us inc filed by the alaska retirement management board in alaska state court the action alleges professional negligence and malpractice breach of contract breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing negligent misrepresentation unfair trade practices and fraud and misrepresentation related to actuarial services that mercer provided to the alaska division of retirement and benefits relating to the alaska public employees retirement system and the alaska teachers retirement system the action also seeks damages including punitive and treble damages in amounts that could if awarded subject mercer to significant monetary damages negative publicity reputational harm and to diversion of personnel and management resources we have limited third party insurance for this matter mmc has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because mmc is unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with fasb asc topic no 450 an adverse outcome in this matter could have a material adverse effect on mmc’s businesses results of operations financial condition or cash flow 

we are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from “errors and omissions” claims 

mmc’s operating companies provide numerous brokerage consulting actuarial and other services for clients around the world as a result of these activities we are subject to errors and omissions or “eo” claims by clients and third parties who allege that they were damaged as a result of the operating company’s alleged failure to perform its services as expected certain of these claims could seek damages in amounts that if awarded could be significant and subject us to potential liability for monetary damages negative publicity reputational harm and to diversion of personnel and management resources 

mmc has varying levels of third party insurance coverage against eo claims depending on the policy year to the extent that expected losses exceed mmc’s retention in any policy year mmc records a liability and an asset for the amount that mmc expects to recover under its thirdparty insurance programs the policy limits and coverage terms of the thirdparty insurance vary to some extent by policy year but mmc is not aware of coverage defenses or other obstacles to coverage that would limit recoveries in years prior to policy year 20012002 in a material amount from 2002 to 2008 the availability of thirdparty insurance declined significantly 

in establishing liabilities for errors and omissions claims in accordance with fasb asc topic no 450 mmc utilizes internal actuarial and other estimates and case level reviews by inside and outside counsel a liability is established when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable the liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant in many cases mmc has not recorded a liability other than for legal fees to defend the claim because mmc is unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable nevertheless given the unpredictability of eo claims and of litigation that could flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on mmc’s businesses results of operations financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period 

  

we are subject to legal proceedings and other contingencies which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

as more fully described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item 8 of this report we are subject to a number of legal proceedings regulatory actions and other contingencies an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flow in any given quarterly or annual period in addition regardless of any eventual monetary costs these matters could have a material adverse effect on mmc or its operating companies by exposing us to negative publicity reputational damage harm to our client or employee relationships or diversion of personnel and management resources 

our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable us federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states and its various states the european union and its member states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate for example our insurance and reinsurance services activities as well as certain of our consulting and related activities in the united kingdom are under the jurisdiction of the financial services authority compliance with foreign and us laws and regulations that are applicable to our international operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions these laws and regulations include import and export requirements us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we our employees our consultants or our contractors are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations including those referred to above we may be subject to investigations criminal sanctions or civil remedies including fines injunctions loss of an operating license or approval increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in a particular business or redress to clients the cost of compliance or the consequences of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations or financial condition in addition these matters could have a material adverse effect on mmc by exposing us to negative publicity reputational damage or harm to our client or employee relationships 

in most jurisdictions government regulatory authorities have the power to interpret or amend applicable laws and regulations and have discretion to grant renew and revoke various licenses and approvals we need to conduct our activities such authorities may require mmc to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations in some areas of our businesses we act on the basis of our own or the industry’s interpretations of applicable laws or regulations which may conflict from state to state or country to country in the event those interpretations eventually prove different from those of regulatory authorities we might be penalized or precluded from carrying on our previous activities moreover the laws and regulations to which we are subject may conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate recent changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to generate additional revenue streams or enhance revenue streams any significant impairment of our ability to conduct our business as we historically have done could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

finally government involvement in the insurance or reinsurance markets could displace insurance or reinsurance currently available from the private market and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation 

one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees and retirement and other benefit plan participants we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information nonetheless we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws and regulations that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

further data privacy is subject to frequently changing laws rules and regulations which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing legal or regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace as well as the general risks described above relating to our compliance systems and controls 

financial risks 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity 

global economic and political conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve in 2008 and 2009 the credit markets and the financial services industry experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy failure collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states and foreign governments these economic conditions have resulted in negative impacts on businesses and financial institutions and financial services entities in particular the global economic crisis has had a significant effect on our consulting and risk consulting and technology segments in particular many of our clients have been reducing expenses including amounts they spend on consulting services if these economic conditions persist or deteriorate they could potentially have a significant impact on our operations 

these economic conditions may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing of those services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain should it become necessary for us to further restructure our business including reducing our work force as a result of these market conditions or other factors that reduce the demand for our products and services our ability to execute our business strategy could be adversely affected 

financial institution failures may cause us to incur increased expenses or make it more difficult either to utilize our existing debt capacity or otherwise obtain financing for our operations investing activities including the financing of any future acquisitions or financing activities 

our cash investments including those held in a fiduciary capacity are subject to general credit liquidity counterparty market and interest rate risks that may be exacerbated by the recent global financial crisis if the banking system or the fixed income credit or equity markets deteriorate further or remain volatile the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected 

credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk 

both moody’s and standard  poor’s downgraded mmc’s senior debt credit rating in late 2004 and sp announced a further downgrade in december 2007 currently mmc’s senior debt is rated baa2 by moody’s and bbb by sp these ratings are the nexttolowest investment grade rating for moody’s and the lowest investmentgrade rating for sp 

if we need to raise capital in the future for example in order to fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives any further credit rating downgrade would increase our 

  

financing costs and could limit our access to financing sources further we believe that a downgrade to a rating below investmentgrade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures 

our significant nonus operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business 

we are subject to exchange rate risk because some of our subsidiaries receive revenue other than in their functional currencies and because we must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in certain jurisdictions however our risk and insurance services operations generate revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in local currency due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we are subject to economic exposure as well as currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations exchange rate risk could have a significant impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

changes in interest rates and increased counterparty risk could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and adversely affect our financial condition or results 

in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis many previously highly rated financial institutions now carry credit ratings that are substantially lower than precrisis levels consequently the aggregate level of counterparty risk is higher and the value of investments with those institutions has declined resulting in substantial trading and investment losses for corporate and other investors in order to avoid these risks investors have favored securities issued guaranteed or supported by the us or international governments which has resulted in reduced yields on these and other investments considered to be lower risk although we generally employ a conservative investment strategy with respect to our cash investments including those held in a fiduciary capacity we may incur investment losses as a result of these unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain low or decline further in this time of economic uncertainty 

our pension obligations may cause mmc’s earnings and cash flows to fluctuate 

mmc has significant pension obligations to its current and former employees totaling approximately 100 billion at december 31 2009 the magnitude of our worldwide pension plans means that our earnings are comparatively sensitive to factors such as equity and bond market returns the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities rates of inflation and mortality assumptions variations in any of these factors could cause significant fluctuation in our earnings from year to year and may result in increased levels of contributions to our pension plans 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

mmc is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries as a holding company without significant operations of our own we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for paying dividends to stockholders and for corporate expenses in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and other payments to mmc we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on common stock 

further mmc derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the us since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are made from the us it is important to be able to access cash generated outside the us funds from mmc’s operating subsidiaries outside of the us are periodically repatriated to the us via shareholder distributions and repayment of intercompany financing a number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive including but not limited to foreign exchange rates and taxrelated costs 

  

in the event we are unable to generate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above our overall liquidity could deteriorate 

international operations 

we are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations 

we do business worldwide in 2009 53 percent of mmc’s total operating segment revenue was generated from operations outside the united states and over onehalf of our employees are located outside the united states we expect to expand our nonus operations further 

the geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal economic operational market compliance and reputational risks these include among others risks relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake hurricane terrorist attack pandemic security breach power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems would provide us with an important advantage nevertheless we could still experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations such as key executive officers or personnel 

our operations particularly within our consulting and risk consulting and technology segments are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business 

  

continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario 

we regularly assess and take steps to improve upon our existing business continuity plans and key management succession however a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability 

competitive risks 

each of mmc’s businesses operates in a highly competitive environment if we fail to compete effectively our business and results of operations will suffer 

as a global professional services firm mmc experiences acute and continuous competition in each of its operating segments our ability to compete successfully depends on a variety of factors including our geographic reach the sophistication and quality of our services and our pricing relative to our competitors if we are unable to respond successfully to the competition we face our business and results of operations will suffer 

in our risk and insurance services segment we compete intensely against two other major global brokerage firms aon and willis for both client business and employee talent we also face competition from a wide range of other insurance brokerage firms that operate on a regional national or local scale we compete as well with insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or other market intermediaries and with various other companies that provide riskrelated services the above competition is intensified by an industry trend toward a “syndicated” or “distributed” approach to the purchase of insurance brokerage services whereby a client engages multiple brokers to service different portions of the client’s account 

in our consulting and risk consulting and technology segments we compete for business and employee talent with numerous independent consulting firms and organizations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms around the world kroll also competes with law firms and consulting firms for certain of its services 

the loss of key professionals could hurt our ability to retain existing client revenues and generate revenues from new business 

across all of our businesses our personnel are crucial to developing and retaining the client relationships on which our revenues depend it is therefore very important for us to retain significant revenueproducing employees and the key managerial and other professionals who support them we face numerous challenges in this regard including 

 

  

  

 losing employees who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements which would adversely affect our results of operations in addition if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 

consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our business 

particularly in the current economic environment companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other 

  

companies if two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business guy carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the marketplace 

our businesses face rapid technological changes and our failure to adequately anticipate or respond to these changes could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

to remain competitive in many of our business areas we must identify the most current technologies and methodologies and integrate them into our service offerings for example guy carpenter’s riskmodeling services are increasingly dependent on implementing advanced software and datacompilation tools kroll’s ediscovery business depends on advanced search technology and computerized document processing and mercer’s ability to price its outsourcing services competitively is highly dependent on the efficient and cost effective use of technology if we do not make the correct technology choices or investments or if our choices or investments are insufficiently prompt or costeffective our business and results of operations could suffer 

acquisitions and dispositions 

we face risks when we acquire and dispose of businesses 

we have a history of making acquisitions including a total of 49 acquisitions in the period 20052009 for aggregate purchase consideration of 10 billion we have also exited various businesses including the sale of putnam investments trust “putnam” in august 2007 the divestiture of three separate restructuring businesses—one in the us and two in the uk—in 2008 the sale of kroll government services in 2009 and the sale of kroll laboratory specialists in the first quarter of 2010 we expect that acquisitions and dispositions will continue to be part of our business strategy our success in this regard will depend on our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition candidates and to complete with favorable results the transactions we decide to pursue 

while we intend that our acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability we cannot be certain that our past or future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations acquisitions involve special risks including accounting regulatory or compliance issues that could arise in connection with or as a result of the acquisition of the acquired company the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue profit or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect in addition if in the future the performance of our reporting units or an acquired business varies from our projections or assumptions or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units or an acquired business change the estimated fair value of our reporting units or an acquired business could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill and other acquisitionrelated intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet for example since our acquisition of kroll in july 2004 mmc has recorded goodwill impairment charges related to the risk consulting  technology segment of 540 million in 2008 and 315 million in 2009 given the significant size of mmc’s goodwill and intangible assets a writedown of this sort could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given period as of december 31 2009 mmc’s consolidated balance sheet reflected 72 billion of goodwill and intangible assets representing approximately 47 percent of mmc’s total consolidated assets and allocated by reporting segment as follows risk and insurance services 42 billion consulting 2 billion and risk consulting and technology 10 billion 

when we dispose of businesses we are subject to the risk contractually agreed or otherwise of posttransaction liabilities for example as described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item 8 of this report we have retained certain contingent litigation liabilities relating to putnam 

  

risks relating to our risk and insurance services segment 

our risk and insurance services segment conducted through marsh and guy carpenter represented 50 percent of mmc’s total operating segment revenue in 2009 our business in this segment is subject to particular risks 

results in our risk and insurance services segment may be adversely affected by a general decline in economic activity 

demand for many types of insurance and reinsurance generally rises and falls as economic growth expands or slows this dynamic affects the level of commissions and fees generated by marsh and guy carpenter to the extent our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions they may choose to limit their purchases of insurance and reinsurance coverage as applicable which would inhibit our ability to generate commission revenue and may decide not to purchase our risk advisory services which would inhibit our ability to generate fee revenue moreover insolvencies and combinations associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies and combinations in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business guy carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the market place 

volatility or declines in premiums and other market trends may significantly impede our ability to improve revenues and profitability 

a significant portion of our risk and insurance services revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to the general phenomenon of pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their riskprotection needs this trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to “selfinsure” the use of socalled “captive” insurers and the advent of capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance and reinsurance needs 

risks relating to our consulting and risk consulting and technology segments 

our consulting segment conducted through mercer and oliver wyman group represented 44 percent of our total operating segment revenue in 2009 our risk consulting and technology segment conducted through kroll represented 6 percent of our total operating segment revenue in 2009 our businesses in these two segments are subject to particular risks 

demand for our services might decrease for various reasons including a general economic downturn a decline in a client’s or an industry’s financial condition or changes in government regulation 

our consulting and risk consulting and technology segments have historically achieved significant annual revenue growth despite this history however the recent global economic conditions have resulted in negative impacts on businesses and financial institutions many of our clients have been reducing expenses including amounts spent on consulting services the evolving needs or financial circumstances of our clients may challenge our ability to increase revenues and profitability and reduce demand for our services if the economy or markets in which we operate experience continued weakness at current levels or deteriorate further our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition demand for many of mercer’s benefits services is affected by government regulation and tax rules which drive our clients’ needs for benefitsrelated services for example significant 

  

changes in government regulations affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of mercer’s services 

our profitability may suffer if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and pricing rates for our consultants 

the profitability of our consulting and risk consulting and technology businesses depends in part on ensuring that our consultants maintain adequate utilization rates ie the percentage of our consultants’ working hours devoted to billable activities our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the factors listed above and therefore also our utilization rates for service personnel have been adversely affected by recent macroeconomic conditions if the utilization rate for our consulting professionals continues to decline our profit margin and profitability would suffer 

in addition the profitability of our consulting and risk consulting and technology businesses depends on the prices we are able to charge for our services our pricing power is affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our pricing has also been adversely affected by the recent economic crisis if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for our services our margins and profitability could suffer 

our quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly 

quarterly variations in revenues and operating results at mercer oliver wyman group and kroll may occur due to several factors these include 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 a significant portion of total operating expenses at mercer oliver wyman group and kroll is relatively fixed therefore a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results for these businesses 

if we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us the increasing number of insolvencies in the current economic environment and the numerous bankruptcy laws to which they are subject could also adversely affect our ability to collect receivables or unbilled services timely collection of client balances depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

acceleration of the shift by employers from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans could adversely affect mercer’s operating results 

mercer currently provides clients with consulting services relating to both defined benefit and defined contribution plans defined benefit pension plans generally require more services than defined contribution plans because defined benefit plans typically involve large asset pools complex calculations to determine employer costs funding requirements and sophisticated analysis to match liabilities and assets over long periods of time recent regulatory initiatives in the united states and certain european countries may result in companies either discontinuing or curtailing defined benefit programs in favor of defined contribution plans if organizations shift to defined contribution plans more rapidly than we anticipate and we do not successfully adjust our service offerings to take account of that change mercer’s operating results could be adversely affected

consulting operating income decreased 150 million to 405 million in 2009 primarily due to reduced profitability in the first and second quarters of the year as both mercer and oliver wyman group saw revenue declines as a result of the difficult economic environment the consulting segment was also impacted by currency exchange rate movements particularly sterling and the euro which reduced the translated amount of 2009 net operating income by approximately 60 million compared with 2008 

risk consulting  technology incurred an operating loss of 272 million in 2009 compared with a 512 million operating loss in 2008 operating results include goodwill impairment charges of 315 million and 540 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively results in 2008 also included a loss of 28 million on the disposal of the uk corporate restructuring businesses

revenue 

consolidated revenue for 2009 decreased 9 to 105 billion compared with 115 billion in 2008 reflecting a 5 decrease in underlying revenue and a 4 negative impact of foreign currency translation

consolidated operating expenses in 2008 increased 10 which included the 540 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2008 and a 283 million increase from restructuring and noteworthy charges in 2008 as compared with 2007 excluding these two items expenses increased 2 in 2008 compared with 2007 and were essentially flat on an underlying basis

risk and insurance services 

in the risk and insurance services segment mmc’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers agents or consultants for insureds insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management insurance broking and insurance program management services primarily under the name of marsh and engage in reinsurance broking catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions primarily under the name of guy carpenter 

marsh and guy carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients andor commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided the particular insurer or reinsurer the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients revenues are affected by premium rate levels in the insurancereinsurance markets the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insuredsreinsureds in many cases compensation may be negotiated in advance based on the types and amounts of risks to be analyzed by mmc and ultimately placed into the insurance market or retained by the client the trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next will therefore be affected by changes in premium rate levels fluctuations in client risk retention and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured as well as new and lost business and the volume of business from new and existing clients 

  

marsh and guy carpenter receive interest income on certain funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others the investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities these regulations typically provide for segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates both of which vary from time to time for presentation purposes fiduciary interest is segregated from the other revenues of marsh and guy carpenter and separately presented within the segment as shown in the revenue by segments charts earlier in this mda 

the results of operations for the risk and insurance services segment are presented below 

 

 revenue 

revenue in risk and insurance services decreased 3 in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting a 4 negative impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations a 1 decrease on an underlying basis partly offset by a 2 increase from acquisitions 

in marsh revenue decreased 5 from 2008 reflecting a 4 negative impact of currency translation and a 1 decrease in underlying revenue these results reflect the continued difficult economic environment in addition to the pressure on insurance premium levels commissions and fees despite these difficult conditions on a geographic basis marsh’s international revenue increased 2 on an underlying basis reflecting a 9 increase in latin america and a 5 increase in asia pacific reflecting strong new business production on a global basis offset by a decrease of 4 in the us  canada region 

guy carpenter’s revenue of 911 million in 2009 increased 13 compared with the prior year or 8 on an underlying basis the increase in underlying revenue was primarily due to higher client revenue retention and an increase in new business in april 2009 guy carpenter completed the acquisition of john b collins associates inc previously the fifthlargest reinsurance intermediary in the us and seventhlargest in the world in october 2009 guy carpenter completed the acquisition of londonbased specialty reinsurance broker rattner mackenzie limited from hcc insurance holdings inc these acquisitions contributed 7 to the yearoveryear revenue growth

fiduciary interest income for the segment decreased 22 in 2008 compared with 2007 or 23 on an underlying basis primarily due to lower interest rates and to a lesser extent lower average invested funds 

  

expense 

expenses in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 10 in 2009 compared with the prior year underlying expenses decreased 8 with the remaining reduction due to the impact of foreign currency exchange of 4 partly offset by an increase of 1 due to the impact of acquisitions the decline in underlying expenses reflects lower compensation and benefit costs and a decrease in other operating cost categories as the company continues its efforts to monitor and control expenses despite increased variable compensation total compensation and benefits expense decreased reflecting lower total base compensation due to the reductions in the number of employees as a result of restructuring activities the decrease in other expenses includes a reduction in professional liability costs reflecting the impact of a 33 million charge recorded in the third quarter of 2008 and a reduction of 39 million in net settlement legal and regulatory costs reduced by insurance recoveries in 2009 the expense decrease also reflects lower restructuring and related costs in 2009 as compared with 2008 

in 2008 expenses in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 1 compared with the prior year reflecting a 2 decrease in underlying expenses partly offset by a 1 increase related to the impact of foreign exchange the reduction in compensation and benefits expense in 2008 compared with 2007 reflects a reduction in headcount during the year and a decline in benefits expenses partly offset by increased incentive compensation costs and higher severance costs at both marsh and guy carpenter the decrease in other expenses reflects the continued focus on expense control and primarily relates to reductions in travel entertainment meetings marketing and advertising these decreases were partly offset by higher restructuring and related costs in 2008 compared with 2007 and a 33 million charge in the third quarter of 2008 related to a professional liability claim 

consulting 

mmc conducts business in its consulting segment through two main business groups mercer provides consulting expertise advice services and solutions in the areas of retirement health  benefits rewards talent  communications outsourcing and investment consulting  management oliver wyman group provides specialized management and economic and brand consulting services 

the major component of revenue in the consulting segment business is fees paid by clients for advice and services mercer principally through its health  benefits line of business also earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group and occasionally individual insurance contracts primarily life health and accident coverages revenue for mercer’s investment management business and certain of mercer’s outsourcing businesses consists principally of fees based on assets under management or administration 

revenue in the consulting segment is affected by among other things global economic conditions including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets revenue is also subject to competition due to the introduction of new products and services broad trends in employee demographics including levels of employment the effect of government policies and regulations and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates revenues from the provision of investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by securities market performance 

the results of operations for the consulting segment are presented below 

 

   

revenue 

consulting revenue in 2009 decreased 11 compared with the same period in 2008 or 7 on an underlying basis due to the difficult economic conditions both mercer and oliver wyman experienced decreased demand for consulting services in 2009 mercer’s revenue decreased 9 or 4 on an underlying basis reflecting decreases in underlying revenue in consulting and outsourcing of 4 and 6 respectively partly offset by an increase in investment consulting and management of 6 within mercer’s consulting lines underlying revenue in retirement decreased 1 versus prior year health and benefits decreased 1 and rewards talent  communications decreased 17 oliver wyman’s revenue decreased 17 or 15 on an underlying basis compared with the prior year 

consulting revenue in 2008 increased 6 compared with 2007 comprising 8 growth at mercer and 2 growth at the oliver wyman group revenue for the segment increased 4 on an underlying basis within mercer the revenue increase of 8 reflects growth in retirement of 9 health and benefits of 9 other consulting lines of 9 outsourcing of 3 and investment consulting  management of 14 mercer’s revenue grew 7 on an underlying basis revenue for the oliver wyman group grew 2 but decreased 2 on an underlying basis compared with the same period in 2007 

expense 

consulting expenses decreased 9 in 2009 compared with the same period in 2008 reflecting a 4 decrease from the impact of foreign exchange rates and a 6 decrease on an underlying basis the decline in underlying expenses reflects a decrease in base salaries and employee benefits due to decreased staff levels along with cost reductions in all discretionary expense categories and lower recoverable expenses from clients these decreases were partly offset by an increase in professional liability costs of approximately 30 million primarily reflecting a legal settlement at mercer and higher severance costs at oliver wyman due to capacity reductions 

consulting expenses increased 8 in 2008 compared with 2007 or 6 on an underlying basis compensation and benefit costs increased due to a higher volume of activity at mercer largely in the first three quarters of the year as part of its ongoing effort to realize operational efficiencies mercer reduced its headcount in the fourth quarter of 2008 resulting in a 40 million restructuring charge the increase in other operating expenses reflects a 70 million increase resulting from expenses that are reimbursable by clients 

risk consulting  technology 

mmc’s risk consulting  technology segment which comprises the activity of kroll and corporate advisory and restructuring includes risk consulting and related investigative intelligence financial security and technology services 

in may 2009 kroll sold kgs its government services business the results of kgs’s operations have been reclassified into discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying income statements 

as previously discussed during the fourth quarter of 2008 mmc disposed of its us and uk restructuring businesses to their respective management teams in separate leveraged buyouts based on the terms and conditions of the disposals mmc determined it has “continuing involvement” in these businesses as that term is used in sec staff accounting bulletin topic 5e therefore the results of these businesses including the loss on disposal are included in continuing operations 

kroll receives compensation primarily in the form of fees paid by clients these fees are typically earned on an hourly project fixed fee or perunit basis kroll’s revenue is subject to changes in international economic and regulatory conditions including the levels of mortgage applications and new employment kroll is also subject to normal competitive forces such as pricing pressures demand for professional staff and new product development on the part of competitors particularly in technology services 

  

the results of operations for the risk consulting  technology segment are presented below 

 

 revenue 

risk consulting  technology revenues in 2009 decreased 28 compared with 2008 primarily reflecting the divestiture of corporate advisory and restructuring as well as a decrease in underlying revenue at kroll kroll’s revenue was 667 million a decrease of 16 from the previous year or 12 on an underlying basis the underlying revenue decrease was driven by declines in background screening of 9 risk mitigation and response of 26 and in litigation support and data recovery of 5 in may 2009 kroll sold its government services business which has been reclassified into discontinued operations for all periods presented 

risk consulting  technology revenues in 2008 decreased 2 compared with 2007 or 6 on an underlying basis revenue in kroll’s litigation support and data recovery and risk mitigation and response businesses increased 6 and 2 respectively on an underlying basis compared with 2007 revenues in kroll’s background screening business decreased 11 due to declines in both employment and mortgage related background screening corporate advisory and restructuring revenue was 127 million in 2008 compared with 172 million in 2007 due to the disposal of the us and uk restructuring businesses results in 2009 and in the future will only include revenue earned by mmc under the royalty arrangements discussed above 

expense 

risk consulting  technology expenses decreased 35 in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting the impact of goodwill impairment charges of 315 million and 540 million recorded in 2009 and 2008 respectively and a decrease in restructuring and related charges of 36 million excluding these charges risk consulting  technology expenses for 2009 decreased 28 compared to prior year on an underlying basis expenses decreased 18 as compared to prior year the decrease in expenses reflects lower salaries due to decreased headcount a lower level of recoverable expenses from kroll clients and a favorable impact on the yearoveryear expense comparison due to the 28 million loss on the disposal of the uk corporate and advisory businesses recorded in 2008 

risk consulting  technology expenses in 2008 increased 71 compared with 2007 expenses in 2008 included the 540 million goodwill impairment charge restructuring charges of 17 million and the 28 million loss on the disposal of the uk corporate and advisory businesses excluding these items risk consulting  technology expenses for 2008 increased 1 compared with 2007 but decreased 2 on an underlying basis 

corporate expenses

corporate expenses were 255 million in 2008 compared to 200 million in 2007 in 2008 expenses include 85 million of restructuring and related charges comprising a 62 million charge related to estimated future rent and other real estate costs to exit five floors in mmc’s new york headquarters building and previously vacated space in the uk and other locations in 2007 restructuring and related items were 28 million expenses in 2008 include a 10 million credit for a payment from us investigative services inc “usis” in connection with the hiring of mmc’s former ceo partly offset by costs related to the departure of several senior executives

in 2007 discontinued operations include the gain on the sale of putnam putnam’s operating income through august 2 2007 and the operating results for kgs 

summarized statements of income data for discontinued operations are as follows 

 

   

corporate items 

 

 

interest 

interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to 17 million in 2009 compared with 48 million in 2008 the decrease in interest income is due to lower average interest rates in 2009 compared with the prior year interest expense of 241 million in 2009 increased 21 million from the prior year this increase is primarily due to the prefunding in the first quarter of the 400 million of senior notes that matured in june 2009 the higher interest rate on the new bonds compared with those that matured as well as higher interest expense associated with acquisition related liabilities mmc used the proceeds of the newly issued senior notes to fund the maturity of 400 million of senior notes in june 2009 

corporate interest income decreased from 95 million in 2007 to 48 million in 2008 the decrease primarily reflects the combined effect of lower average interest rates and a lower level of invested balances in 2008 compared with the prior year the invested balances in the second half of 2007 were higher primarily due to proceeds received from the putnam transaction which were subsequently used to repurchase mmc shares pay down debt and pay taxes on the gain on the disposal interest expense of 220 million in 2008 decreased from 267 million in 2007 the decrease in interest expense is due to a decrease in the average level of debt outstanding compared to the prior year 

investment income loss 

in 2009 investment losses were 2 million compared with a 12 million loss in the prior year the decrease reflects lower marktomarket declines on risk capital holdings’ private equity investments recorded in 2009 compared to 2008 and realized gains relating to the sale of equity securities recorded in 2009 the gains of 173 million recorded in 2007 primarily related to marktomarket gains on private equity fund investments and gains from the sale of investments 

income taxes 

mmc’s consolidated effective tax rate in 2009 was 145 the tax rate reflects reductions relating to a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and foreign operations taxed at rates lower than the us statutory tax rate partially offset by the effect of a nondeductible 315 million noncash goodwill impairment charge the decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulted from expiring statutes of limitations audit settlements and changes in estimates 

mmc’s consolidated effective tax rate in 2008 was 2078 tax expense exceeded income before taxes and minority interest primarily as a result of a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge of 540 million partially offset by foreign operations taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate because the impairment charge was not deductible for tax purposes it reduced pretax income without a corresponding decrease in tax in addition significantly lower pretax income caused the tax components to disproportionately affect the tax rate magnifying the effect of foreign operations state taxes and other permanent differences 

the 2007 consolidated effective tax rate of 349 primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of international tax law changes in 2007 

the lower tax rate generally attributed to mmc’s foreign operations reflects income taxed at rates lower than the 35 us federal tax rate net of the us tax impact of repatriation of foreign earnings the reduced effective tax rate primarily reflects lower corporate tax rates that prevail outside of the us enhanced by planning that further reduces the impact of taxes worldwide under current us tax law the company anticipates its nonus operations will continue to incur taxes at rates under 35 although the percentage impact on the tax rate is expected to moderate as increases in us pretax income change the geographic mix of income 

nevertheless the effective tax rate is expected to remain significantly variable for the foreseeable future the rate is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of mmc’s earnings which may have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the rate this also could result in foreign tax credit carryforwards 

  

arising in future periods for which a valuation allowance may be required losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations and may require valuation allowances affecting the rate depending on estimates of the realizability of associated deferred tax assets the tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitation 

the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the tax benefits are deductible or creditable mmc and marsh have been profitable globally however tax liabilities are determined and assessed on a legal entity and jurisdictional basis certain taxing jurisdictions allow or require combined or consolidated tax filings in the united states certain groups within mmc which file on a combined basis and certain entities within marsh’s operations which file on a separate entity basis incurred losses for the last two years as well as the current year mmc assessed the realizability of its domestic deferred tax assets particularly state deferred tax assets of marsh relating to jurisdictions in which it files separate tax returns state deferred tax assets of all of mmc’s domestic operations related to jurisdictions in which mmc files a unitary or combined state tax return and foreign tax credit carryforwards in mmc’s consolidated us federal tax return when making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at december 31 2009 mmc considered all available evidence placing particular weight on evidence that could be objectively verified the evidence considered included i the nature frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses ii actions completed that are designed to reduce capacity and adjust to lower demand in the current economic environment iii profit trends evidenced by recent improvements in mmc’s and marsh’s operating performance iv the nonrecurring nature of some of the items that contributed to the cumulative losses v the carryforward periods for the net operating losses “nols” and foreign tax credit carryforwards vi the sources and timing of future taxable income giving weight to sources according to the extent to which they can be objectively verified and vii tax planning strategies that would be implemented if necessary to accelerate utilization of nols based on its assessment mmc concluded that it is more likely than not that a substantial portion of these deferred tax assets are realizable and a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce the domestic tax assets to the amount that mmc believes is more likely than not to be realized in the event sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods additional valuation allowances of up to 170 million could be required relating to these domestic deferred tax assets the realization of the remaining us federal deferred tax assets is not as sensitive to us profits because it is supported by anticipated repatriation of future earnings from mmc’s profitable global operations in addition when making its assessment about the realization of its domestic deferred tax assets at december 31 2009 mmc continued to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets of certain other entities with a history of recent losses including other us entities that file separate state tax returns and foreign subsidiaries and recorded valuation allowances as appropriate 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate for example proposals for fundamental us international tax reform such as the recent proposal by president obama’s administration if enacted could have a significant adverse impact on the effective tax rate 

liquidity and capital resources 

mmc’s liquidity needs are primarily for operating expenses servicing debt funding pension obligations paying dividends on outstanding stock funding acquisitions and capital expenditures as a holding company mmc’s primary source for meeting these requirements is cash flows from operating subsidiaries other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows 

cash on our consolidated balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheet as an offset to fiduciary liabilities fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for mmc

mmc generated 640 million of cash from operations in 2009 compared with 940 million in 2008 these amounts reflect the net income loss reported by mmc during those periods excluding gains or losses from investments and the disposition of businesses adjusted for noncash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets cash generated from the disposition of businesses is included in investing cash flows in december 2009 mmc paid 435 million into settlement funds related to the securities and erisa class action lawsuits described above through december 31 2009 mmc collected 163 million of the total 230 million recovery from its insurers the remaining 67 million of insurance recoveries which were received in january 2010 are recorded in other receivables in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2009 as described above mmc accrued an additional 25 million of settlement costs which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2009 in 2007 cash outflows included tax payments of 933 million related to the disposition of businesses primarily putnam although the cash proceeds from the putnam transaction are included in investing cash flows the applicable accounting literature specifies that the related payment of taxes be included in operating cash flows and not allocated to other cash flow categories 

mmc’s expected funding for its us nonqualified and nonus pension plans in 2010 is approximately 25 million and 250 million respectively mmc’s policy for funding its taxqualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable foreign laws there currently is no erisa funding requirement for the us qualified plan for 2009 or 2010 funding requirements for nonus plans vary by country contribution rates are determined by the local actuaries based on local funding practices and requirements funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in addition amounts funded in the future to the extent not due under regulatory requirements may be affected by alternative uses of mmc’s cash flows including dividends investments and share repurchases 

during 2009 mmc’s defined benefit pension plan assets experienced investment gains of 13 in the us and 15 in the uk our largest plan in 2008 defined benefit plan assets experienced investment losses of 18 in the us and 14 in the uk due to the severe downturn in the global equity markets 

pension liabilities are largely impacted by the discount rate set as of yearend in the us interest rates used to discount liabilities continued to decline during 2009 resulting in a lower yearend discount rate in 2009 than the prior yearend this contributed to the increase in the projected benefit obligation for the us plans from 2008 to 2009 while our us plans show a funding deficit as of the end of 2009 no contributions to the us qualified plan are required in 2010 

our uk plan liabilities increased in local currency terms in 2009 primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate in addition to scheduled contributions made to the uk plan throughout 2009 in the first half of the year we made discretionary pension contributions of approximately 150 million to the plan these contributions are included in the 400 million of contributions to nonus plans noted below overall mmc’s aggregate pension expense in 2010 is expected to increase by approximately 110 million before the partlyoffsetting impacts on bonuses and other incentive compensation and possible movement of foreign exchange rates 

during 2009 mmc contributed 22 million to the us pension plans and approximately 400 million to the significant nonus pension plans compared with 20 million for us plans and 250 million for significant nonus plans in 2008 

financing cash flows 

net cash used for financing activities was 464 million in 2009 compared with 643 million of net cash used for financing activities in 2008 mmc reduced outstanding debt by approximately 10 million and 260 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively during 2007 mmc reduced outstanding debt by approximately 11 billion and repurchased 13 billion of its common stock these actions are discussed more fully below 

  

debt 

during 2009 mmc’s 7125 tenyear 400 million bond matured mmc used cash on hand as well as the proceeds from the issuance of 925 tenyear 400 million senior notes in the first quarter to manage liquidity including the funding of the maturing notes 

during 2008 mmc’s 3625 fiveyear fixed rate 250 million senior notes matured mmc used cash on hand to manage liquidity including the repayment of these notes 

during 2007 mmc utilized commercial paper and bank borrowings as well as cash on hand to manage liquidity including the funding of maturing bonds and the repurchase of shares in the first quarter of 2007 mmc’s 5375 fiveyear 500 million senior notes matured mmc’s threeyear floating rate 500 million senior notes matured in the third quarter of 2007 mmc used a portion of its proceeds from the putnam transaction to pay down outstanding commercial paper and revolving credit facility borrowings at december 31 2008 no commercial paper or revolving credit facility borrowings were outstanding 

in the first quarter of 2009 marsh acquired the remaining minority interest of a previously majority owned entity for total purchase consideration of 47 million reflecting cash paid of 24 million and future consideration of 23 million 

on october 23 2009 mmc and certain of its foreign subsidiaries entered into a new 10 billion multicurrency threeyear unsecured revolving credit facility which replaced the 12 billion facility that was previously in place the interest rate on this facility varies based upon mmc’s credit ratings and mmc’s credit default swap levels subject to floors and caps the facility requires mmc to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at december 31 2009 

mmc’s senior debt is currently rated baa2 by moody’s and bbb by standard  poor’s mmc’s shortterm debt is currently rated p2 by moody’s and a3 by standard  poor’s mmc carries a stable outlook from both moody’s and standard  poor’s 

mmc also maintains other credit facilities guarantees and letters of credit with various banks primarily related to operations located outside the united states aggregating 250 million at december 31 2009 and 285 million at december 31 2008 there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at december 31 2009 

share repurchases 

in august 2007 mmc entered into an 800 million accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution counterparty under the terms of the agreement mmc paid the full 800 million purchase price and took delivery from the counterparty of an initial tranche of 21320530 shares of mmc common stock which were reflected as an increase in treasury shares a decrease in shares outstanding on the delivery date this number of shares was the quotient of the 800 million purchase price divided by a contractual “cap” price of 375225 per share based on the market price of mmc’s common stock over the subsequent settlement period in march 2008 the counterparty delivered to mmc an additional 10751000 shares for no additional payment and the transaction was concluded mmc thus repurchased a total of 32071630 shares at an average price per share to mmc of 249442 the repurchased shares were reflected as an increase in treasury shares a decrease in shares outstanding on the respective delivery dates this transaction was effected under a 15 billion share repurchase authorization granted by mmc’s board of directors in august 2007 mmc remains authorized to repurchase additional shares of its common stock up to a value of 700 million there is no time limit on this authorization 

in may 2007 mmc entered into a 500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution counterparty under the terms of the agreement mmc paid the full 500 million purchase price and took delivery from the counterparty of an initial tranche of 13464749 shares of mmc common stock based on the market price of mmc’s common stock over the subsequent settlement period in july 2007 the counterparty delivered to mmc an additional 2555519 shares for 

  

no additional payment and the transaction was concluded mmc thus repurchased a total of 16020268 shares in the transaction for a total cost of 500 million and an average price per share to mmc of 312105 the repurchased shares were reflected as an increase in treasury shares a decrease in shares outstanding on the respective delivery dates this transaction was effected under a 500 million share repurchase authorization granted by mmc’s board of directors in may 2007 

dividends 

mmc paid total dividends of 431 million in 2009 080 per share 412 million 080 per share in 2008 and 413 million 076 per share in 2007 

investing cash flows 

net cash used for investing activities amounted to 236 million in 2009 this compares with 348 million of net cash used for investing activities in 2008 cash used for acquisitions totaled 73 million in 2009 compared with 126 million in 2008 remaining deferred cash payments of approximately 119 million related to acquisitions completed in 2009 and prior years are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2009 cash provided by the sale of securities was 42 million and 20 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

mmc’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software which amounted to 305 million in 2009 and 386 million in 2008 primarily relate to computer equipment purchases the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs 

in 2007 mmc generated 30 billion of cash from investing activities primarily due to the putnam transaction 

mmc has committed to potential future investments of approximately 81 million in connection with its investments in trident ii and other funds managed by stone point capital llc the majority of mmc’s investment commitments for funds managed by stone point capital llc are related to trident ii the investment period for which is now closed for new investments any remaining capital calls for trident ii would relate to followon investments in existing portfolio companies or for management fees or other partnership expenses significant future capital calls related to trident ii are not expected although it is anticipated that trident ii will be harvesting its remaining portfolio the timing of any portfolio company sales and capital distributions is unknown and not controlled by mmc 

commitments and obligations 

the following identifies mmc’s future contractual obligations by the types identified in the table below as of december 31 2009 

 

 the above does not include unrecognized tax benefits of 206 million as mmc is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities other than approximately 16 million that may become payable during 2010 the above does not include the indemnified liabilities discussed in note 16 as mmc is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities the above does not include pension liabilities of 937 million because the timing and amount of ultimate payment of 

  

such liability is dependent upon future events including but not limited to future returns on plan assets and changes in the discount rate used to measure the liabilities mmc expects to contribute 25 million and 250 million in 2010 to its us nonqualified and nonus pension plans respectively 

market risk and credit risk 

certain of mmc’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets 

interest rate risk and credit risk 

mmc has historically managed its net exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing a mixture of variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance mmc’s asset base during 2007 virtually all of mmc’s variable rate borrowings were repaid 

interest income generated from mmc’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates particularly shortterm interest rates 

mmc had the following investments subject to variable interest rates 

 

 these investments and debt instruments are discussed more fully in note1 to the consolidated financial statements appearing in item 8 of this report 

based on the above balances if shortterm interest rates increase by 10 or 8 basis points over the course of the year annual interest income including interest earned on fiduciary funds would increase by approximately 3 million 

in addition to interest rate risk our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counterparty credit risk to minimize this risk mmc and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a boardapproved investment policy the policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counterparty limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment mmc carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions the majority of cash and fiduciary funds are invested in shortterm bank deposits and liquid money market funds 

foreign currency risk 

the translated values of revenue and expense from mmc’s international operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates the nonus based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 53 of total revenue note 17 details revenue by geographic area we periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business although mmc has significant revenue generated in foreign locations which is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in nearly all cases both the foreign currency revenue and expenses are in the functional currency of the foreign location as such the us dollar translation of both the revenues and expenses as well as the potentially offsetting movements of various currencies against the us dollar generally tends to mitigate the impact on net operating income of foreign currency risk however in 2009 mmc’s consulting segment was impacted by significant currency exchange rate movements particularly in sterling and the euro which reduced the translated amount of 2009 operating income by approximately 60 million compared with 2008 mmc estimates that a 10 movement of major foreign currencies euro sterling australian dollar and canadian dollar in the same direction against the us dollar that held over the course of the year would impact full year net operating income by approximately 40 million 

  

equity price risk 

mmc holds investments in public and private companies as well as in certain private equity funds managed by stone point capital publicly traded investments of 38 million are classified as available for sale nonpublicly traded investments of 53 million are accounted for using the cost method and 189 million are accounted for using the equity method the investments that are classified as available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of changes in market value which if determined to be other than temporary could result in realized impairment losses mmc periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements 

other 

a significant number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

management’s discussion of critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding mmc’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from those estimates 

legal and other loss contingencies 

mmc and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims lawsuits and proceedings gaap requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance mmc analyzes its litigation exposure based on available information including consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of these matters to assess its potential liability 

in addition to the extent that insurance coverage is available significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under mmc’s various insurance programs 

retirement benefits 

mmc maintains qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible us employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible nonus employees mmc’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable foreign laws 

mmc recognizes the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” net of tax in mmc’s consolidated balance sheets 

the determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and assumed rate of salary increase significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements mmc believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate actuarial assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate based on its current assumptions mmc expects pension expense in 2010 to increase approximately 110 million compared with 2009 

  

future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions future investment performance future assumptions and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans holding all other assumptions constant a halfpercentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the us and uk plans which together comprise approximately 87 of total pension plan liabilities as follows 

 

 changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense because the longterm rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate 

mmc contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees the cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the us is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire but is funded by mmc as incurred the key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

mmc’s tax rate reflects its income statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions mmc reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the evaluation of a tax position is a twostep process the first step involves recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on only the technical merits of the position the technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes legislative intent regulations rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 

uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue 

tax law requires items be included in mmc’s tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements in assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be 

  

realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly mmc evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance mmc also considers taxplanning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years if carryback is permitted under the appropriate tax law the underlying assumptions mmc uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account mmc’s recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carryforwards are deductible or creditable valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction 

fair value determinations 

investment valuation—mmc holds investments in both public and private companies as well as certain private equity funds the majority of the public investments are accounted for as available for sale securities certain investments primarily investments in private equity funds are accounted for using the equity method although not directly recorded in mmc’s consolidated balance sheets mmc’s defined benefit pension plans hold investments of approximately 9 billion the fair value of these investments determines in part the over or underfunded status of those plans which is included in mmc’s consolidated balance sheets mmc periodically reviews the carrying value of its investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements mmc bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they relate to each investment fair value of investments in private equity funds is determined by the funds’ investment managers factors considered in determining the fair value of private equity investments include implied valuation of recently completed financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors performance multiples of comparable public companies restrictions on the sale or disposal of the investments trading characteristics of the securities and the relative size of the holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public market float in those instances where quoted market prices are not available particularly for equity holdings in private companies or formal restrictions limit the sale of securities significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate value of mmc’s investments mmc reviews with the fund manager the appropriateness of valuation results for significant private equity investments 

goodwill impairment testing—mmc is required to assess goodwill and any indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred mmc performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a market approach or a discounted cash flow model carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level as previously disclosed mmc performed interim goodwill impairment assessments in its risk consulting  technology segment which resulted in an impairment charge of 315 million recorded in the first quarter of 2009 and impairment charges totaling 540 million recorded in the first and second quarters of 2008 mmc completed its 2009 annual review in the third quarter of 2009 and concluded that the remaining goodwill was not impaired the fair value estimates used in this assessment are dependent upon assumptions and estimates about the future profitability and other financial ratios of our reporting units as well as relevant financial data recent transactions and market valuations of comparable public companies as noted above mmc recorded goodwill impairment charges related to the kroll reporting unit in 2008 and 2009 as such the estimated fair value of the kroll reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by only a small percentage in addition in the most recent goodwill impairment assessment the excess of the estimated fair value of the oliver wyman reporting unit over its carrying value declined substantially compared with prior years’ valuations if in the future the performance of our reporting units varies from our projections or our assumptions or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units change the estimated fair value of our reporting units could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill particularly with regard to the kroll and oliver wyman reporting units 

  

sharebased payment 

the guidance for accounting for sharebased payments requires among other things that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values in addition management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards as defined by the accounting guidance 

as of december 31 2009 there was 152 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards the weightedaverage periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 19 years also as of december 31 2009 there was 262 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to mmc’s restricted stock restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards

regulation 

mmc’s activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under united states federal and state laws as well as laws of other countries in which mmc’s subsidiaries operate see part i item 1a “risk factors” below for a discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our businesses 

risk and insurance services  while laws and regulations vary from location to location every state of the united states and most foreign jurisdictions require insurance market intermediaries and related service providers such as insurance brokers agents and consultants reinsurance brokers 

  

managing general agents and third party administrators to hold an individual andor company license from a governmental agency or selfregulatory organization some jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locallyowned business entities in this case if mmc has no licensed subsidiary we may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction 

beginning in january 2005 all european union member states were required to implement the insurance mediation directive this directive aims to apply consistent minimum professional standards to insurance intermediaries including a licensing system based on an assessment of factors such as professional competence financial capacity and professional indemnity insurance as member states of the european union adopt regulations to comply with the directive our insurance intermediary operations in the european union have become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements in january 2005 as part of the implementation of the directive in the united kingdom the power and responsibilities of the financial services authority or fsa were expanded to include regulation of insurance and reinsurance intermediaries in the united kingdom 

insurance authorities in the united states and certain other jurisdictions in which mmc’s subsidiaries do business including the fsa in the united kingdom also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others these laws and regulations typically provide for segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them 

certain of mmc’s risk and insurance services activities are governed by other regulatory bodies such as investment securities and futures licensing authorities in the united states marsh and guy carpenter use the services of mmc securities corp a usregistered brokerdealer and investment advisor member finrasipc primarily in connection with investment bankingrelated services and advising on alternative risk financing transactions also in the united states marsh uses the services of interlink securities corp primarily in connection with variable insurance products guy carpenter provides advice on securities or investments in the european union through mmc securities europe ltd formerly gc securities ltd which is authorized and regulated by the fsa marsh receives investment management services in the european union from another mmc subsidiary marsh investment service limited which is also regulated by the fsa mmc securities corp interlink securities corp and mmc securities europe ltd are indirect whollyowned subsidiaries of mmc

consulting  certain of mercer’s retirementrelated consulting services are subject to pension law and financial regulation in many countries including by the securities and exchange commission or sec in the united states and the fsa in the united kingdom in addition the trustee services investment services including advice to individuals on the investment of personal pension assets and assumption of discretionary investment management responsibilities and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services provided by mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to investment and securities regulations in various jurisdictions the benefits insurance consulting and brokerage services provided by mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to the same licensing requirements and regulatory oversight as the insurance market intermediaries described above regarding our risk and insurance services businesses in the united states mercer and oliver wyman group use the services of mmc securities corp primarily in connection with the sale of retirement and employee benefit plans and investment banking services respectively

competitive conditions 

mmc faces strong competition in all of its businesses from providers of similar products and services mmc also encounters strong competition throughout its businesses from both public corporations and private firms in attracting and retaining qualified employees in addition to the discussion below see “risks relating to mmc generally –competitive risks” in part i item 1a of this report 

risk and insurance services  mmc’s combined insurance and reinsurance services businesses are global in scope the principal bases upon which our insurance and reinsurance businesses compete include the range quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients mmc encounters strong competition from other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis from a large number of regional and local firms in the united states the european union and elsewhere from insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses including commercial and investment banks accounting firms and consultants that provide riskrelated services and products although the major global insurance brokerage firms against whom marsh competes have like us stopped using contingent commission arrangements many specialist regional and local firms have not done so the continuing acceptance of contingent commission revenue by certain of marsh’s competitors may provide them greater pricing flexibility and put marsh at a competitive disadvantage 

certain insureds and groups of insureds have established programs of self insurance including captive insurance companies as a supplement or alternative to thirdparty insurance thereby reducing in some cases their need for insurance placements there are also many other providers of affinity group and private client services including specialized firms insurance companies and other institutions 

the continuing impact of legal and regulatory proceedings concerning our insurance brokerage operations also could affect marsh’s competitive position these proceedings are discussed in more detail in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included under part ii item 8 of this report please also read our discussion of the risks associated with these proceedings and their impact under part i item 1a “risk factors” below 

consulting  mmc’s consulting and hr outsourcing businesses face strong competition from other privately and publicly held worldwide and national companies as well as regional and local firms these businesses compete generally on the basis of the range quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients competitors include independent consulting and outsourcing firms as well as consulting and outsourcing operations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms 

mercer’s investment consulting and investment management businesses face competition from many sources including multimanager services offered by other investment consulting firms and financial institutions 

in many cases clients have the option of handling the services provided by mercer and oliver wyman group internally without assistance from outside advisors 

risk consulting  technology  in risk consulting and technology we face competition from local regional national and international firms that provide similar services in the fields of accounting investigative and security services consulting and technology services kroll’s consulting services group faces competition from local regional national and international accounting firms who provide forensic accounting litigation support and investigative services as well as other specialist firms providing architectural engineering and security consulting services kroll’s litigation support and data recovery and background screening businesses face competition from a variety of law firms independent service providers and technology companies

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information presented in this report these risks have the potential to materially adversely affect mmc’s business results of operations or financial condition 

risks relating to mmc generally 

legal and regulatory issues 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other contingencies which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

as more fully described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item 8 of this report we are subject to a number of legal proceedings regulatory actions and other contingencies an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period in addition regardless of any eventual monetary costs these matters could have a material adverse effect on mmc by exposing us to negative publicity reputational damage harm to our client or employee relationships or diversion of personnel and management resources 

we are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from “errors and omissions” claims 

mmc’s operating companies provide numerous brokerage consulting actuarial and other services for clients around the world as a result of these activities we are subject to errors and omissions or “eo” claims by clients and third parties who allege that they were damaged as a result of the operating company’s alleged failure to perform its services as expected such as those claims alleged in separate lawsuits by the alaska retirement management board and milwaukee county against mercer certain eo claims seek damages including punitive damages in amounts that could if awarded be significant and subject mmc in addition to potential liability for monetary damages to reputational harm and diversion of personnel and management resources as described below for certain policy years we have limited third party insurance for eo matters including the alaska retirement management board and milwaukee county matters 

mmc has varying levels of third party insurance coverage against eo claims depending on the policy year to the extent that expected losses exceed mmc’s retention in any policy year mmc records a liability and an asset for the amount that mmc expects to recover under its thirdparty insurance programs the policy limits and coverage terms of the thirdparty insurance vary to some extent by policy year but mmc is not aware of coverage defenses or other obstacles to coverage that would limit recoveries in years prior to policy year 20012002 in a material amount 

in policy years subsequent to 20012002 the availability of thirdparty insurance has declined significantly which has caused mmc to assume increasing levels of selfinsurance for its potential eo exposures mmc utilizes internal actuarial and other estimates and case level reviews by inside and outside counsel to establish loss reserves in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” to provide for its loss retention these reserves are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant nevertheless given the unpredictability of eo claims and of litigation that could flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on mmc’s results of operations financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period 

our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable us federal and state or foreign laws and regulations and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states and its various states the european union and its member states and the other jurisdictions in which we 

  

operate for example our insurance and reinsurance services activities as well as certain of our consulting and related activities in the united kingdom are under the jurisdiction of the financial services authority compliance with foreign and us laws and regulations that are applicable to our international operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions these laws and regulations include import and export requirements us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we our employees our consultants or our contractors are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations including those referred to above we may be subject to investigations criminal sanctions or civil remedies including fines injunctions loss of an operating license or approval the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in a particular business or redress to clients the cost of compliance or the consequences of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition these matters could have a material adverse effect on mmc by exposing us to negative publicity reputational damage or harm to our client or employee relationships 

in most jurisdictions government regulatory authorities have the power to interpret or amend applicable laws and regulations and have discretion to grant renew and revoke various licenses and approvals we need to conduct our activities such authorities may require mmc to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations in some areas of our businesses we act on the basis of our own or the industry’s interpretations of applicable laws or regulations which may conflict from state to state or country to country in the event those interpretations eventually prove different from those of regulatory authorities we might be penalized or precluded from carrying on our previous activities moreover the laws and regulations to which we are subject may conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services any significant impairment of our ability to conduct our business as we historically have done could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

finally government involvement in the insurance or reinsurance markets could displace insurance or reinsurance currently available from the private market and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation 

one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees and retirement and other benefit plan participants we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information nonetheless we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

further data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace 

international operations 

we are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations 

we do business worldwide in 2008 54 percent of mmc’s total operating segment revenue was generated from operations outside the united states and over onehalf of our employees are located abroad we expect to expand our nonus operations further 

  

the geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal economic operational market and reputational risks these include among others risks relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake hurricane terrorist attack pandemic security breach power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems would provide us with an important advantage nevertheless we could still experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations such as key executive officers or personnel 

our operations particularly within our consulting and risk consulting and technology segments are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario 

we regularly assess and take steps to improve upon our existing business continuity plans and key management succession however a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability 

  

competitive risks 

each of mmc’s businesses operates in a highly competitive environment if we fail to compete effectively our business and results of operations will suffer 

as a global professional services firm mmc experiences acute and continuous competition in each of its operating segments our ability to compete successfully depends on a variety of factors including our geographic reach the sophistication and quality of our services and our pricing relative to our competitors if we are unable to respond successfully to the competition we face our business and results of operations will suffer 

in our risk and insurance services segment we compete intensely against two other major global brokerage firms aon and willis for both client business and employee talent we also face competition from a wide range of other insurance brokerage firms that operate on a regional national or local scale many of these firms unlike marsh aon and willis have not stopped accepting contingent commissions and thus may have greater pricing flexibility than we do we compete as well with insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or other market intermediaries and with various other companies that provide riskrelated services the above competition is intensified by an industry trend toward a “syndicated” or “distributed” approach to the purchase of insurance brokerage services whereby a client engages multiple brokers to service different portions of the client’s account 

in our consulting and risk consulting and technology segments we compete for business and employee talent with numerous independent consulting firms and organizations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms around the world kroll also competes with law firms for certain of its services 

the loss of key professionals could hurt our ability to retain existing client revenues and generate revenues from new business 

across all of our businesses our personnel are crucial to developing and retaining the client relationships on which our revenues depend it is therefore very important for us to retain significant revenueproducing employees and the key managerial and other professionals who support them we face numerous challenges in this regard including 

 

  

  

 losing employees who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements which would adversely affect our results of operations in addition if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 

consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our business 

particularly in the current economic environment companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business guy carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the marketplace 

  

our businesses face rapid technological changes and our failure to adequately anticipate or respond to these changes could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

to remain competitive in many of our business areas we must identify the most current technologies and methodologies and integrate them into our service offerings for example guy carpenter’s riskmodeling services are increasingly dependent on implementing advanced software and datacompilation tools kroll’s ediscovery business depends on advanced search technology and computerized document processing and mercer’s ability to price its outsourcing services competitively is highly dependent on the efficient and cost effective use of technology if we do not make the correct technology choices or investments or if our choices or investments are insufficiently prompt or costeffective our business and results of operations could suffer 

financial risks 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity 

global economic and political conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve recently the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy failure collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states and foreign governments these economic conditions have resulted in negative impacts on businesses and financial institutions and financial services entities in particular the current global economic crisis is having a significant effect on our consulting and risk consulting and technology segments in particular many of our clients have been reducing expenses including amounts they spend on consulting services if these economic conditions persist or deteriorate they could potentially have a significant impact on our operations 

these economic conditions may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing of those services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain should it become necessary for us to further restructure our business including reducing our work force as a result of these market conditions or other factors that reduce the demand for our products and services our ability to execute our business strategy could be adversely affected 

financial institution failures may cause us to incur increased expenses or make it more difficult either to utilize our existing debt capacity or otherwise obtain financing for our operations investing activities including the financing of any future acquisitions or financing activities 

our cash investments including those held in a fiduciary capacity are subject to general credit liquidity counterparty market and interest rate risks that may be exacerbated by the recent global financial crisis if the banking system or the fixed income credit or equity markets continue to deteriorate or remain volatile the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected 

our significant nonus operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business 

we are subject to exchange rate risk because some of our subsidiaries receive revenue other than in their functional currencies and because we must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars our us operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in us dollars in certain jurisdictions primarily the united kingdom however our risk and insurance services operations generate revenue in a number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely incurred in local currency due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we are subject to economic exposure as well as currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations exchange rate risk could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

  

changes in interest rates and increased counterparty risk could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and adversely affect our financial condition or results 

the recent failures bankruptcies rescues and distressed acquisitions of previously highly rated financial institutions indicate a possibly dramatic realignment of companies in the financial services sector and reflect the market’s lack of a clear understanding of the financial health of financial institutions many widelyheld investments previously rated investment grade have declined in value precipitously and unexpectedly in recent months resulting in substantial trading and investment losses for corporate and other investors in order to avoid these risks investors have favored securities issued guaranteed or supported by the us or international governments which has resulted in reduced yields on these and other investments considered to be lower risk although we generally employ a conservative investment strategy with respect to our cash investments including those held in a fiduciary capacity we may incur investment losses as a result of these unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain low or decline further in this time of economic uncertainty 

credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk 

both moody’s and standard  poor’s downgraded mmc’s senior debt credit rating in late 2004 and sp announced a further downgrade in december 2007 currently mmc’s senior debt is rated baa2 by moody’s and bbb by sp these ratings are the nexttolowest investment grade rating for moody’s and the lowest investmentgrade rating for sp 

if we need to raise capital in the future for example in order to fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives any further credit rating downgrade would increase our financing costs and could limit our access to financing sources further we believe that a downgrade to a rating below investmentgrade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures 

our pension obligations may cause mmc’s earnings and cash flows to fluctuate 

mmc has significant pension obligations to its current and former employees totaling approximately 85 billion at december 31 2008 the magnitude of our worldwide pension plans means that our earnings are comparatively sensitive to factors such as equity and bond market returns the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities rates of inflation and mortality assumptions variations in any of these factors could cause significant fluctuation in our earnings from year to year and may result in increased levels of contributions to our pension plans 

acquisitions and dispositions 

we face risks when we acquire and dispose of businesses 

we have a history of making acquisitions including our 19 billion acquisition of kroll in july 2004 and a total of 44 acquisitions in the period 20052008 for aggregate purchase consideration of 593 million we have also exited various businesses including the sale of putnam in august 2007 and the divestiture of three separate restructuring businesses – one in the us and two in the uk – in 2008 we expect that targeted acquisitions and dispositions will continue to be part of our business strategy our success in this regard will depend on our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition candidates and to complete with favorable results the transactions we decide to pursue 

while we intend that our acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability we cannot be certain that our past or future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations acquisitions involve special risks including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue profit or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect in addition if the operating performance of an acquired business deteriorates significantly we may need to write down the value of the goodwill and other acquisitionrelated intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet given the significant size of 

  

mmc’s goodwill and intangible assets a writedown of this sort could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given period as of december 31 2008 mmc’s consolidated balance sheet reflected 72 billion of goodwill and intangible assets representing approximately 47 percent of mmc’s total consolidated assets and allocated by reporting segment as follows risk and insurance services 37 billion consulting 2 billion and risk consulting and technology 11 billion 

when we dispose of businesses we are subject to the risk contractually agreed or otherwise of posttransaction liabilities for example as described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item 8 of this report we have retained certain contingent litigation liabilities relating to putnam 

risks relating to our risk and insurance services segment 

our risk and insurance services segment conducted through marsh and guy carpenter represented 47 percent of mmc’s total operating segment revenue in 2008 our business in this segment is subject to particular risks 

volatility or declines in premiums and other market trends may significantly impede our ability to improve revenues and profitability 

a significant portion of our risk and insurance services revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage we have no control over premium rates and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to the general phenomenon of pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their riskprotection needs this trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to “selfinsure” the use of socalled “captive” insurers and the advent of capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance and reinsurance needs 

we may not be as successful as we hope in implementing marsh’s evolving business model and otherwise coping with changing modes of compensation in the insurance brokerage industry 

in late 2004 marsh made significant changes to its business model including the elimination of market servicecontingent commission agreements with insurers the elimination of market service revenue has negatively affected our financial results in 2004 we recognized market service revenue of 516 million relating to insurance placements made before october 1 2004 by contrast in 2005 2006 2007 and 2008 respectively we recognized 114 million 43 million 3 million and 17 million of market service revenue relating to placements made before october 1 2004 in addition to lost revenue marsh has and will likely continue to incur significant costs to ensure compliance with this business model and to provide disclosure relating thereto 

although other large insurance brokers have similarly terminated the use of contingent commission agreements many specialist regional and local insurance brokers have not to date there has been no regulatory action to end the use of contingent commission arrangements throughout the brokerage industry and it is therefore unclear to what extent many of our competitors will continue to accept contingent commission revenue it is possible that marsh will continue indefinitely to suffer competitive disadvantage compared to the brokers that have not given up the use of contingent commission arrangements if that occurs marsh would continue to face pressure on its revenues operating margin and market share 

  

in addition to the possibility of continued competitive disadvantage as described above marsh faces risks relating to the implementation of its new business model marsh is currently seeking to increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that are disclosed to its clients and to generate profitable revenue growth by focusing on the provision of valueadded risk advisory services beyond traditional brokerage activities marsh’s current business and compensation model continues to evolve and in some respects remains untested including marsh’s creation of placement hubs and the launch of marsh  mclennan agency for the small and emerging growth sector we cannot be certain that it will generate the profitable revenue growth we are targeting the inability to derive adequate revenues from marsh’s current business and compensation model may significantly impede improvement in our operating results and profitability 

results in our risk and insurance services segment may be adversely affected by a general decline in economic activity 

demand for many types of insurance and reinsurance generally rises and falls as economic growth expands or slows this dynamic affects the level of commissions and fees generated by marsh and guy carpenter to the extent our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions they may choose to limit their purchases of insurance and reinsurance coverage as applicable which would inhibit our ability to generate commission revenue and may decide not to purchase our risk advisory services which would inhibit our ability to generate fee revenue moreover a growing number of insolvencies and combinations associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies and combinations in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business guy carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the market place 

risks relating to our consulting and risk consulting and technology segments 

our consulting segment conducted through mercer and oliver wyman group represented 45 percent of our total operating segment revenue in 2008 our risk consulting and technology segment conducted through kroll represented 9 percent of our total operating segment revenue in 2008 our businesses in these two segments are subject to particular risks 

demand for our services might decrease for various reasons including a general economic downturn a decline in a client’s or an industry’s financial condition or changes in government regulation 

our consulting and risk consulting and technology segments have historically achieved significant annual revenue growth despite this history however the current global economic conditions have resulted in negative impacts on businesses and financial institutions and financial services entities in particular many of our clients especially in the financial services industry have been reducing expenses including amounts spent on consulting services the evolving needs or financial circumstances of our clients may challenge our ability to increase revenues and profitability and reduce demand for our services if the economy or markets in which we operate experience continued weakness at current levels or deteriorate further our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition demand for many of mercer’s benefits services is affected by government regulation and tax rules which drive our clients’ needs for benefitsrelated services for example significant changes in government regulations affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of mercer’s services 

  

our profitability may suffer if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and pricing rates for our consultants 

the profitability of our consulting and risk consulting and technology businesses depends in part on ensuring that our consultants maintain adequate utilization rates ie the percentage of our consultants’ working hours devoted to billable activities our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the factors listed above and therefore also our utilization rates for service personnel have been adversely affected by recent macroeconomic conditions if the utilization rate for our consulting professionals continues to decline our profit margin and profitability would suffer 

in addition the profitability of our consulting and risk consulting and technology businesses depends on the prices we are able to charge for our services our pricing power is affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our pricing has also been adversely affected by the current economic crisis if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for our consultants our profit margin and profitability could suffer 

our quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly 

quarterly variations in revenues and operating results at mercer oliver wyman group and kroll may occur due to several factors these include 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 a significant portion of total operating expenses at mercer oliver wyman group and kroll is relatively fixed therefore a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results for these businesses 

if we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us the increasing number of insolvencies in the current economic environment and the numerous bankruptcy laws to which they are subject could also adversely affect our ability to collect receivables or unbilled services timely collection of client balances depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

acceleration of the shift by employers from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans could adversely affect mercer’s operating results 

mercer currently provides clients with actuarial and consulting services relating to both defined benefit and defined contribution plans defined benefit pension plans generally require more services than defined contribution plans because defined benefit plans typically involve large asset pools complex calculations to determine employer costs funding requirements and sophisticated analysis to match liabilities and assets over long periods of time recent regulatory initiatives in the united states and certain european countries may result in companies either discontinuing or curtailing defined benefit programs in favor of defined contribution plans if organizations shift to defined contribution plans more rapidly than we anticipate and we do not successfully adjust our service offerings to take account of that change mercer’s operating results could be adversely affected

consolidated revenues and expenses 

mmc conducts business in many countries as a result of which the impact of foreign exchange rate movements may impact periodtoperiod comparisons of revenue similarly the revenue impact of acquisitions and dispositions may impact periodtoperiod comparisons of revenue underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by isolating these impacts the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations acquisitions and dispositions on mmc’s operating revenues by segment is as follows 

 

  

    

 

 

  

   

revenue 

consolidated revenue for 2008 increased 4 to 116 billion compared with 112 billion in 2007 reflecting a 2 increase in underlying revenue a 1 increase from acquisitions and a 1 positive impact of foreign currency translation

consolidated operating expenses in 2007 increased 10 compared with 2006 operating expenses increased 5 on an underlying basis in 2007 compared with 2006 the increase in underlying expenses was due to higher compensation and benefit costs driven by the consulting segment due to increased volume across all practices increased advertising primarily in insurance services and favorable professional liability experience in 2006

risk and insurance services 

in the risk and insurance services segment mmc’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers agents or consultants for insureds insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management insurance broking and insurance program management services primarily under the name of marsh and engage in reinsurance broking catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions primarily under the name of guy carpenter 

marsh and guy carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients andor commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided the particular insurer or reinsurer the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients revenues are affected by premium rate levels in the insurancereinsurance markets the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insuredsreinsureds in many cases compensation may be negotiated in advance based on the types and amounts of risks to be analyzed by mmc and ultimately placed into the insurance market or retained by the client the trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next will therefore be affected by changes in premium rate levels fluctuations in client risk retention and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured as well as new and lost business and the volume of business from new and existing clients 

marsh and guy carpenter receive interest income on certain funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others the investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities these regulations typically provide for segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates both of which vary from time to time for presentation purposes fiduciary interest is now segregated within the segment from the other revenues of marsh and guy carpenter as shown in the charts on pages 29 and 30 

  

the results of operations for the risk and insurance services segment are presented below 

 

 revenue 

revenue in risk and insurance services increased 1 in 2008 compared with 2007 reflecting the positive impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations and was flat on an underlying basis

guy carpenter revenue decreased 6 in 2008 compared with 2007 or 7 on an underlying basis reinsurance premium rates declined during the year across most coverages 

fiduciary interest income decreased 22 in 2008 or 23 on an underlying basis primarily due to lower interest rates and to a lesser extent lower average invested funds 

revenue in risk and insurance services increased 3 in 2007 compared with 2006 reflecting the positive impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations partly offset by a decrease in underlying revenue 

expense 

expenses in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 1 in 2008 compared with the prior year reflecting a 2 decrease in underlying expenses partly offset by a 1 increase related to the impact of foreign exchange the reduction in compensation and benefits expense in 2008 compared with 2007 reflects a reduction in headcount during the year and a decline in benefits expenses partly offset by increased incentive compensation costs and higher severance costs at both marsh and guy carpenter the decrease in other expenses reflects the continued focus on expense control and primarily relate to reductions in travel entertainment meetings and marketing and advertising these decreases were partly offset by higher restructuring and related costs in 2008 compared with 2007 and a 33 million charge in the third quarter of 2008 related to a professional liability claim 

in 2007 expenses in the risk and insurance services segment increased 6 over the prior year the increase in expenses reflected higher salary costs due to increased headcount during the second half of the year the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations costs associated with marsh’s advertising campaign initiated in the spring of 2007 incremental expenses related to the departure of marsh’s former ceo and the effect of favorable professional liability experience in 2006 these increases were partly offset by lower restructuring and related costs compared with 2006 and reduced incentive compensation accruals 

consulting 

mmc conducts business in its consulting segment through two main business groups mercer includes practice groups specializing in retirement health and benefits outsourcing and investment consulting and management oliver wyman group provides specialized management and economic and brand consulting services 

the major component of consulting’s revenue in both mercer and oliver wyman group is fees paid by clients for advice and services mercer principally through its health  benefits line of business also 

  

earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group and occasionally individual insurance contracts primarily life health and accident coverages revenue for mercer’s investment management business and certain of mercer’s outsourcing businesses consists principally of fees based on assets under administration 

revenue in the consulting segment is affected by among other things global economic conditions including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets revenue is also subject to competition due to the introduction of new products and services broad trends in employee demographics the effect of government policies and regulations and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates revenues from the provision of investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by securities market performance 

the results of operations for the consulting segment are presented below 

 

 revenue 

consulting revenue in 2008 increased 6 compared with 2007 comprising 8 growth at mercer and 2 growth at oliver wyman group revenue for the segment increased 4 on an underlying basis within mercer the revenue increase of 8 reflects growth in retirement of 9 health and benefits of 9 other consulting lines of 9 outsourcing of 3 and investment consulting  management of 14 mercer’s revenue grew 7 on an underlying basis oliver wyman group grew 2 but decreased 2 on an underlying basis compared with the same period last year 

consulting revenue in 2007 increased 16 compared with 2006 revenue for mercer increased 12 or 7 on an underlying basis driven by strong growth throughout its businesses oliver wyman group revenues grew 26 or 18 on an underlying basis compared with the same period in 2006 

expense 

consulting expenses increased 8 in 2008 compared with 2007 or 6 on an underlying basis compensation and benefit costs increased due to a higher volume of activity at mercer largely in the first three quarters of the year as part of its ongoing effort to realize operational efficiencies mercer reduced its headcount in the fourth quarter of 2008 resulting in a 40 million restructuring charge the increase in other operating expenses reflects a 70 million increase resulting from expenses that are reimbursable by clients 

consulting expenses increased 14 in 2007 compared with 2006 reflecting higher compensation costs due to an increased volume of business higher incentive compensation commensurate with improved operating performance and the impact of foreign currency translation 

risk consulting  technology 

mmc’s risk consulting  technology segment which comprises the activity of kroll and corporate advisory and restructuring includes risk consulting and related investigative intelligence financial security and technology services 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 mmc sold its us and uk restructuring businesses to their respective management teams in separate leveraged buyouts based on the terms and conditions of the disposals mmc determined it has “continuing involvement” in these businesses as that term is used in sec staff accounting bulletin topic 5e mmc recorded a loss of 28 million on the disposition 

  

of the uk restructuring businesses the net assets of the uk businesses were writtenoff upon transfer to the new owners mmc will receive royalties on future revenue of these businesses over the next four years the royalties will be recognized when earned under the terms of the contract and when collectibility is reasonably assured the transfer of the us restructuring business was financed with a seller note if mmc receives interest and principal payments as scheduled for the us business it will recover the value of the net assets transferred to the new owners and recognize a gain on the disposal of 18 million 

kroll receives compensation primarily in the form of fees paid by clients these fees are typically earned on an hourly project fixed fee or perunit basis kroll’s revenue is subject to changes in international economic and regulatory conditions including the levels of mortgage applications and new employment kroll is also subject to normal competitive forces such as pricing pressures demand for professional staff and new product development on the part of competitors particularly in technology services 

the results of operations for the risk consulting  technology segment are presented below 

 

 revenue 

risk consulting  technology revenues increased 1 compared with 2007 but decreased 3 on an underlying basis revenue in kroll’s litigation support and data recovery and risk mitigation and response businesses increased 6 and 12 respectively on an underlying basis compared with 2007 revenues in kroll’s background screening business decreased 11 due to declines in both employment and mortgage related background screening corporate advisory and restructuring revenue was 127 million in 2008 compared with 172 million in 2007 due to the disposal of the us and uk restructuring businesses future results will only include revenue earned by mmc under the royalty arrangements discussed earlier 

risk consulting  technology revenues increased 1 in 2007 compared with 2006 and were flat on an underlying basis revenue in kroll’s litigation support and data recovery and background screening increased 14 and 5 respectively on an underlying basis compared with 2006 this was offset by a 23 decrease in corporate advisory and restructuring revenue due to weaker demand for these services including lower client success fees for completed engagements compared with 2006 

expense 

risk consulting  technology expenses in 2008 increased 68 compared with 2007 expenses in 2008 included the 540 million goodwill impairment charge restructuring charges of 17 million and the 28 million loss on the disposal of the uk restructuring businesses excluding these items risk consulting  technology expenses for 2008 increased 2 compared with 2007 and were essentially the same as last year on an underlying basis 

risk consulting  technology expenses increased 7 in 2007 compared with 2006 approximately half of the increase results from acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency fluctuation the remaining increase reflects higher compensation in the corporate advisory and restructuring and the 

  

background screening businesses as well as increased costs for outside services in the background screening business due to a higher volume of business in addition expenses in 2006 included a credit related to the early termination of a licensing agreement 

discontinued operations 

results of discontinued operations in 2008 include the effects of three discontinued operations –putnam mediservice and kroll crucible – which are discussed in more detail below 

with regard to putnam discontinued operations in 2008 includes 1 the impact of immaterial corrections and other adjustments to the fourth quarter of 2007 tax provision related to the transaction 2 adjustments to the tax provision to reflect differences between tax returns filed in 2008 and the initial estimated provisions and 3 interest on liabilities for certain taxrelated indemnities provided as part of the transaction in the first quarter of 2008 marsh completed the sale of mediservice a claims administration operation in brazil the gain on this disposal net of tax is included in discontinued operations in 2008 in the third quarter of 2008 kroll completed the sale of kroll crucible “crucible” a division of its government services operation the loss on this disposal net of tax is included in discontinued operations in 2008

the following depicts the results of discontinued operations including revenue and expense detail for putnam 

 

   

corporate items 

 

 

corporate expenses 

corporate expenses were 255 million in 2008 compared to 200 million in 2007 in 2008 expenses include 85 million of restructuring and related charges comprising a 62 million charge related to estimated future rent and other real estate costs to exit five floors in mmc’s new york headquarters building and previously vacated space in the uk and other locations in 2007 restructuring and related items were 28 million expenses in 2008 include a 10 million credit for a payment from us investigative services inc “usis” in connection with the hiring of mmc’s former ceo partly offset by costs related to the departure of several senior executives 

corporate expenses were 200 million in 2007 compared to 137 million in 2006 in 2007 corporate expenses included 28 million for restructuring and related charges including a credit from an accrual adjustment related to the separation of former mmc senior executives compared with a credit of 31 million of such items in 2006 that included a 74 million gain on the sale of five floors in mmc’s headquarters building in 2007 corporate expenses also included incremental costs of 14 million related to the departure of mmc’s former ceo 

interest 

corporate interest income decreased from 95 million in 2007 to 48 million in 2008 the decrease primarily reflects the combined effect of lower average interest rates and a lower level of invested balances in 2008 compared with the prior year the invested balances in the second half of 2007 were higher primarily due to proceeds received from the putnam transaction which were subsequently used to repurchase mmc shares pay down debt and pay taxes on the gain on the disposal interest expense of 220 million in 2008 decreased from 267 million in 2007 the decrease in interest expense is due to a decrease in the average level of debt outstanding compared to the prior year 

interest income earned on corporate funds was 95 million in 2007 an increase of 35 million over 2006 the increase in interest income reflects generally higher average interest rates in 2007 compared with 2006 and higher invested balances during the second half of the year resulting from the receipt of proceeds from the putnam transaction discussed above interest expense of 267 million in 2007 decreased from 303 million from 2006 the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in the average level of debt compared with the prior year 

investment income loss 

in 2008 investment losses were 12 million primarily due to marktomarket declines on risk capital holding’s private equity investments this compared with 173 million of gains in the prior period primarily related to marktomarket gains on private equity fund investments and gains from the sale of investments 

income taxes 

mmc’s consolidated effective tax rate in 2008 was significantly impacted by the nondeductibility of the goodwill impairment charge the 2007 consolidated effective tax rate of 349 primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of international tax law changes in 2007 

mmc’s consolidated effective tax rate was 349 in 2007 compared to 298 in 2006 the change primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of international tax law changes in 2007 and the release of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in 2006 

the effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix and repatriation of mmc’s earnings which may have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the rate this also could result in foreign tax credit carryforwards arising in future periods for which a valuation allowance may be required furthermore losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations and may result in the need for valuation allowances against deferred tax assets which would affect the rate 

  

in 2007 mmc adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period subsequent changes in judgment resulting from new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue such adjustments could have a material impact on mmc’s effective tax rate net income and cash flows in a particular future period it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease between zero and approximately 135 million within the next 12 months due to settlement of audits and expiration of statutes of limitation 

liquidity and capital resources 

mmc’s liquidity needs are primarily for operating expenses capital expenditures servicing debt funding pension obligations paying dividends on outstanding stock and funding acquisitions as a holding company mmc’s primary source for meeting these requirements is cash flows from operating subsidiaries other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows 

cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheet as an offset to fiduciary liabilities fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for mmc 

operating cash flows 

mmc generated 837 million of cash from operations in 2008 compared with a use of cash of 385 million in 2007 these amounts reflect the net income loss reported by mmc during those periods excluding gains or losses from investments and the disposition of businesses adjusted for noncash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets cash generated from the disposition of businesses is included in investing cash flows payment of accrued liabilities in 2008 includes approximately 170 million for regulatory settlements this represents the final payment related to the settlement with the nyag and nysid as discussed in note 16 and is consistent with the amount paid in 2007 in 2007 cash outflows included tax payments of 933 million related to the disposition of businesses primarily putnam although the cash proceeds from the putnam transaction are included in investing cash flows sfas 95 specifies that the related payment of taxes be included in operating cash flows and not allocated to other cash flow categories 

mmc’s expected funding for its us nonqualified and nonus pension plans in 2009 is approximately 21 million and 370 million respectively mmc’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable foreign law there currently is no erisa funding requirement for the us qualified plan for 2008 or 2009 funding requirements for nonus plans vary by country contribution rates are determined by the local actuaries based on local funding practices and requirements funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in addition amounts funded in the future to the extent not due under regulatory requirements may be affected by alternative uses of mmc’s cash flows including dividends investments and share repurchases 

during 2008 mmc’s defined benefit pension plans were negatively impacted by the severe downturn in the global equity markets defined benefit assets experienced market declines of approximately 18 in the us and approximately 14 in the uk our largest plan 

pension liabilities are largely dependent on the discount rate set as of year end in the us interest rates declined dramatically over the last two months of 2008 resulting in a lower yearend discount rate than the prior year end this contributed to a 300 million increase in the projected benefit 

  

obligation for the us plans while our us plans show a funding deficit as of the end of 2008 no contributions to the us plan are required in 2009 

due to an increase in the discount rate and a reduction in inflation expectations our uk plan liabilities decreased slightly in local currency terms in 2008 although we make scheduled contributions to the uk plan throughout the year in january 2009 we made a discretionary pension contribution of 70 million to the plan we expect to contribute a similar amount in the second quarter of 2009 these contributions are included in the 370 million of expected contributions noted above overall mmc’s aggregate pension expense in 2009 will be similar to that of 2008 

during 2008 mmc contributed approximately 20 million to the us pension plans and 250 million to the significant nonus pension plans compared with 20 million for us plans and 189 million for significant nonus plans in 2007 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas 158 sfas 158 requires that mmc recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans the “plans” as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability the offsetting adjustment to the amount of assets and liabilities required to be recognized is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in mmc’s 2006 yearend balance sheet subsequent changes in the funded status are recognized through the income statement and other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur as appropriate mmc adopted the provisions of sfas 158 prospectively on december 31 2006 the impact of adopting sfas 158 resulted in a reduction in assets of 660 million and an increase in liabilities of 245 million including a related adjustment to tax benefits of 423 million the net impact of adopting sfas 158 was a reduction of mmc’s stockholders’ equity of 905 million in 2006 or 804 million including an adjustment for the impact of recording a reduction to the minimum pension liability prior to the adoption of sfas 158 in 2007 the improved funded status of the plans resulted in a net increase to equity of 708 million in 2008 the decrease in the funded status of the plans resulted in a net decrease to equity of 988 million the change in funded status of the plans is impacted by numerous items including actual results compared with prior estimates and assumptions contributions to the plans and changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates significant items impacting the funded status of the us and uk plans in 2008 are discussed above in 2007 the funded status of mmc’s plans was significantly impacted by an increase in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31 2007 reflecting a general widening of credit spreads on high quality corporate debt obligations and by contributions and asset returns 

financing cash flows 

net cash used for financing activities was 540 million in 2008 compared with 26 billion of net cash used for financing activities in 2007 during 2008 mmc reduced outstanding debt by approximately 260 million during 2007 mmc reduced outstanding debt by approximately 11 billion and repurchased 13 billion of its common stock these actions are discussed more fully below

mmc’s senior debt is currently rated baa2 by moody’s and bbb by standard  poor’s mmc’s shortterm debt is currently rated p2 by moody’s and a3 by standard  poor’s mmc carries a stable outlook from both moody’s and standard  poor’s in december 2007 standard  poor’s lowered its rating on mmc’s longterm debt from bbb to bbb and lowered the rating on mmc’s shortterm debt from a2 to a3 

mmc also maintains other credit facilities guarantees and letters of credit with various banks primarily related to operations located outside the united states aggregating 285 million at december 31 2008 and 265 million at december 31 2007 there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at december 31 2008

investing cash flows 

net cash used for investing activities amounted to 348 million in 2008 this compares with 30 billion of net cash generated from investing activities in 2007 primarily due to the putnam transaction cash used for acquisitions totaled 126 million in 2008 compared with 206 million in 2007 remaining deferred cash payments of approximately 60 million related to acquisitions completed in 2008 and prior years are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2008 cash provided by the sale of securities was 20 million in 2008 in 2007 cash provided by the sale of securities of 78 million was partly offset by cash used to purchase investments of 44 million 

mmc’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software which amounted to 386 million in 2008 and 378 million in 2007 primarily relate to computer equipment purchases the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs 

  

mmc has committed to potential future investments of approximately 81 million in connection with its investments in trident ii and other funds managed by stone point capital llc the majority of mmc’s investment commitments for funds managed by stone point capital llc are related to trident ii the investment period for which is now closed for new investments any remaining capital calls for trident ii would relate to followon investments in existing portfolio companies or for management fees or other partnership expenses significant future capital calls related to trident ii are not expected although it is anticipated that trident ii will be harvesting its remaining portfolio the timing of any portfolio company sales and capital distributions is unknown and not controlled by mmc 

commitments and obligations 

mmc’s contractual obligations of the types identified in the table below were of the following amounts as of december 31 2008 

 

 the above does not include unrecognized tax benefits of 293 million accounted for under fin 48 as mmc is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities other than approximately 20 million that may become payable during 2009 the above does not include liabilities established under fin 45 as mmc is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities other than approximately 3 million that may become payable during 2009 

market risk and credit risk 

certain of mmc’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets 

interest rate risk and credit risk 

mmc has historically managed its net exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing a mixture of variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance mmc’s asset base during 2007 virtually all of mmc’s variable rate borrowings were repaid 

interest income generated from mmc’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates particularly shortterm interest rates 

mmc had the following investments subject to variable interest rates 

 

 these investments and debt instruments are discussed more fully in the aboveindicated notes to the consolidated financial statements 

based on the above balances if shortterm interest rates decrease by 10 or 13 basis points over the course of the year annual interest income including interest earned on fiduciary funds would decrease by approximately 4 million 

in addition to interest rate risk our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counterparty credit risk to minimize this risk mmc and its subsidiaries 

  

invest pursuant to a board approved investment policy the policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counterparty limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment mmc carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions the majority of cash and fiduciary funds are invested in shortterm bank deposits and liquid money market funds 

foreign currency risk 

the translated values of revenue and expense from mmc’s international risk and insurance services and consulting operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates the nonus based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 54 of total revenue note 17 details revenue by geographic area we periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business 

equity price risk 

mmc holds investments in public and private companies as well as in certain private equity funds managed by stone point capital publicly traded investments of 21 million are classified as available for sale under sfas no 115 nonpublicly traded investments of 91 million are accounted for using the cost method and 207 million are accounted for using the equity method under apb opinion no 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” the investments that are classified as available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of changes in market value which if determined to be other than temporary could result in realized impairment losses mmc periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements 

other 

a significant number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

management’s discussion of critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding mmc’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from those estimates 

legal and other loss contingencies 

mmc and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims lawsuits and proceedings gaap requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant management judgment is required to comply with this guidance mmc analyzes its litigation exposure based on available information including consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of these matters to assess its potential liability 

in addition to the extent that insurance coverage is available significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are expected under mmc’s various insurance programs 

retirement benefits 

mmc maintains qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for its eligible us employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for eligible nonus employees mmc’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable foreign laws 

  

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans – an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132 i” “sfas 158” sfas 158 requires that mmc recognize the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans the “plans” as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” net of tax in mmc’s consolidated balance sheets mmc adopted the provisions of sfas 158 prospectively on december 31 2006 

the determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and assumed rate of salary increase significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements mmc believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate actuarial assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate based on its current assumptions mmc expects pension expense in 2009 to be essentially the same as 2008 

future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions future investment performance future assumptions and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans holding all other assumptions constant a halfpercentage point change in the rate of return and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the us and uk plans which comprise approximately 85 of total pension plan liabilities as follows 

 

 changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense because the longterm rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate 

mmc contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees the cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the united states is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire but is funded by mmc as incurred this postretirement liability is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets the key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

mmc’s tax rate reflects its income statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions on january 1 2007 mmc adopted the provisions of fin 48 to account for the uncertainty in income taxes accordingly mmc reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with fin 48 is a twostep process the first step involves recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on only the technical merits of the position the technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes legislative intent regulations rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position 

  

is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 

uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue prior to january 1 2007 mmc estimated its uncertain income tax obligations in accordance with sfas 109 and sfas 5 mmc recognizes interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

tax law requires items be included in mmc’s tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements in assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly mmc evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance mmc also considers taxplanning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years if carryback is permitted under the appropriate tax law the underlying assumptions mmc uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account mmc’s recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carryforwards are deductible or creditable valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction 

fair value determinations 

investment valuation—mmc holds investments in both public and private companies as well as certain private equity funds the majority of the public investments are accounted for as available for sale securities under sfas no 115 certain investments primarily investments in private equity funds are accounted for using the equity method under apb opinion no 18 although not directly recorded in mmc’s consolidated balance sheets mmc’s defined benefit pension plans hold investments of approximately 8 billion the fair value of these investments determines in part the over or underfunded status of those plans which is included in mmc’s consolidated balance sheets mmc periodically reviews the carrying value of its investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements mmc bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they relate to each investment fair value of investments in private equity funds is determined by the funds’ investment managers factors considered in determining the fair value of private equity investments include implied valuation of recently completed financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors performance multiples of comparable public companies restrictions on the sale or disposal of the investments trading characteristics of the securities and the relative size of the holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public market float in those instances where quoted market prices are not available particularly for equity holdings in private companies or formal restrictions limit the sale of securities significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate value of mmc’s investments mmc reviews with the fund manager the appropriateness of valuation results for significant private equity investments 

  

goodwill impairment testing—under sfas 142 mmc is required to assess goodwill and any indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred mmc performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a market approach or a discounted cash flow model carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level as previously disclosed mmc performed an interim goodwill impairment assessment in its risk consulting  technology segment which resulted in impairment charges totaling 540 million recorded in the first and second quarters of 2008 mmc completed its 2008 annual review in the third quarter of 2008 and concluded that goodwill was not impaired the fair value estimates used in this assessment are dependent upon assumptions and estimates about the future profitability and other financial ratios of our reporting units as well as relevant financial data recent transactions and market valuations of comparable public companies if in the future the performance of our reporting units varies significantly from our projections or our assumptions or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units change the estimated fair value of our reporting units could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill 

sharebased payment 

sfas 123r “sharebased payment” requires among other things that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values in addition management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards as defined by sfas 123r 

as of december 31 2008 there was 168 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards the weightedaverage periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 14 years also as of december 31 2008 there was 288 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to mmc’s restricted stock restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards

regulation 

mmc’s activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under united states federal and state laws as well as laws of other countries in which mmc’s subsidiaries operate see part i item 1a “risk factors” below for a discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our businesses 

risk and insurance services while laws and regulations vary from location to location every state of the united states and most foreign jurisdictions require insurance market intermediaries and related service providers such as insurance brokers agents and consultants reinsurance brokers managing general agents and third party administrators to hold an individual andor company license 

  

from a governmental agency or selfregulatory organization some jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locallyowned business entities in this case if mmc has no licensed subsidiary we may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction 

beginning in january 2005 all european union member states were required to implement the insurance mediation directive this directive aims to apply consistent minimum professional standards to insurance intermediaries including a licensing system based on an assessment of factors such as professional competence financial capacity and professional indemnity insurance as member states of the european union adopt regulations to comply with the directive our insurance intermediary operations in the european union have become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements in january 2005 as part of the implementation of the directive in the united kingdom the power and responsibilities of the financial services authority or fsa were expanded to include regulation of insurance and reinsurance intermediaries in the united kingdom 

insurance authorities in the united states and certain other jurisdictions in which mmc’s subsidiaries do business including the fsa in the united kingdom also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others these laws and regulations typically provide for segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them

competitive conditions 

mmc faces strong competition in all of its business segments from providers of similar products and services mmc also encounters strong competition throughout its businesses from both public corporations and private firms in attracting and retaining qualified employees in addition to the discussion below see “risks relating to mmc generally – competitive risks” in part i item 1a of this report 

risk and insurance services mmc’s combined insurance and reinsurance services businesses are global in scope the principal bases upon which our insurance and reinsurance businesses compete include the range quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients mmc encounters strong competition in the risk and insurance services business from other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis from a large number of regional and local firms in the united states the european union and elsewhere from insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses including commercial and investment banks accounting firms and consultants that provide riskrelated services and products although the major global insurance brokerage firms against whom marsh competes have like us stopped using market service arrangements many specialist regional and local firms have not done so the continuing acceptance of market service or contingent commission revenue by certain of marsh’s competitors may provide them greater pricing flexibility and put marsh at a competitive disadvantage 

certain insureds and groups of insureds have established programs of self insurance including captive insurance companies as a supplement or alternative to thirdparty insurance thereby reducing in some cases their need for insurance placements there are also many other providers of affinity group and private client services including specialized firms insurance companies and other institutions 

the continuing impact of legal and regulatory proceedings concerning our insurance brokerage operations also could affect marsh’s competitive position these proceedings are discussed in more detail in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included under part ii item 8 of this report please also read our discussion of the risks associated with these proceedings and their impact under part i item 1a “risk factors” below 

consulting mmc’s consulting and hr outsourcing businesses face strong competition from other privately and publicly held worldwide and national companies as well as regional and local firms these businesses compete generally on the basis of the range quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients competitors include independent consulting and outsourcing firms as well as consulting and outsourcing operations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms 

mercer’s investment consulting business faces competition from many sources including multimanager services offered by other investment consulting firms and financial institutions mercer’s investment management business which was recently established in particular faces significant competition from betterestablished rivals with greater experience in that market

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information presented in this report these risks have the potential to materially adversely affect mmc’s business results of operations or financial condition 

risks relating to mmc generally 

senior management transition 

our success depends in part on successful transitions in mmc’s and marsh’s senior leadership 

mmc and its insurance services subsidiary marsh are both in the midst of senior leadership transitions mmc announced the departure of marsh’s prior chief executive officer in september 2007 and announced the appointment of daniel s glaser as marsh’s new chief executive officer in december 2007 mmc announced the departure of mmc’s prior chief executive officer in december 2007 and announced the appointment of brian duperreault as mmc’s new chief executive officer in january 2008 mmc’s and marsh’s future performance will depend in part on the ability of messrs duperreault and glaser and their respective senior management teams which include newly hired executives in some positions to develop and successfully implement their business strategies 

legal and regulatory issues 

we are subject to legal proceedings and other contingencies which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

as more fully described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item 8 of this report we are subject to a number of legal proceedings regulatory actions and other contingencies an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period in addition regardless of any eventual monetary costs these matters could have a material adverse effect on mmc by exposing us to negative publicity reputational damage harm to our client or employee relationships or diversion of personnel and management resources 

we are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from “errors and omissions” claims 

mmc’s operating companies provide numerous brokerage consulting and other services for clients around the world as a result of these activities we are potentially subject to errors and omissions or “eo” claims by clients and third parties who may allege that they were damaged as a result of mmc’s failure to perform its duties as expected these claims in any given case might be significant and could subject mmc in addition to potential liability for monetary damages to reputational harm and diversion of personnel and management resources 

since 2001 the worldwide market for professional liability insurance against eo claims has contracted significantly which has caused mmc to assume increasing levels of selfinsurance for its potential eo exposures mmc has established loss reserves which it believes are adequate to provide for this selfinsured retention nevertheless given the unpredictability of eo claims and of litigation that could flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on mmc’s results of operations or financial condition in a given quarterly or annual period 

actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business 

our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states and its various states the european union and its member states and the other jurisdictions in which we 

  

operate some of this regulation has only recently been instituted for example in january 2005 our insurance and reinsurance services activities as well as certain of our consulting activities in the united kingdom came under the jurisdiction of the financial services authority certain of the us laws and regulations to which we are subject relate to the conduct of business abroad by american companies examples are the us foreign corrupt practices act and the rules relating to trade sanctions administered by the us office of foreign assets control 

in most jurisdictions government regulatory authorities have the power to interpret or amend applicable laws and regulations and have discretion to grant renew and revoke various licenses and approvals we need to conduct our activities if we violate applicable laws or regulations in a particular jurisdiction we might be subject to adverse consequences such as the loss of an operating license or approval the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in a particular business redress to clients or fines in some areas of our businesses we act on the basis of our own or the industry’s interpretations of applicable laws or regulations which may conflict from state to state or country to country in the event those interpretations eventually prove different from those of regulatory authorities we might be penalized or precluded from carrying on our previous activities any significant impairment of our ability to conduct our business as we historically have done could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation 

one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees and plan participants we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information nonetheless we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

further data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace 

international operations 

we are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations 

we do business worldwide in 2007 51 percent of mmc’s total operating segments revenue was generated from operations outside the united states and over onehalf of our employees are located abroad we expect to expand our nonus operations further 

the geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal economic operational and market risks these include among others risks relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 in addition we are subject to exchange rate risk because some of our subsidiaries receive revenue other than in their functional currencies and because we generally must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars for example most of mmc’s total operating segments revenue generated outside of the us is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as a consequence significant changes in exchange rates may have a material effect on our reported financial results for any given period 

competitive risks 

each of mmc’s businesses operates in a highly competitive environment if we fail to compete effectively our business and results of operations will suffer 

as a global professional services firm mmc experiences acute and continuous competition in each of its operating segments our ability to compete successfully depends on a variety of factors including our geographic reach the sophistication and quality of our services and our pricing relative to our competitors if we are unable to respond successfully to the competition we face our business and results of operations will suffer 

in our risk and insurance services segment we compete intensely against two other major global brokerage firms aon and willis for both client business and employee talent we also face competition from a wide range of other insurance brokerage firms that operate on a regional national or local scale many of these firms unlike marsh aon and willis have not stopped using market service arrangements and thus may have greater pricing flexibility than we do we compete as well with insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or other market intermediaries and with various other companies that provide riskrelated services the above competition is intensified by an emerging industry trend toward a “syndicated” or “distributed” approach to the purchase of insurance brokerage services whereby a client engages multiple brokers to service different portions of the client’s account 

in our consulting and risk consulting and technology segments we compete for business and employee talent with numerous independent consulting firms and organizations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms around the world kroll also competes with law firms for certain of its services 

the loss of key professionals could hurt our ability to retain existing client revenues and generate revenues from new business 

across all of our businesses our personnel are crucial to developing and retaining the client relationships on which our revenues depend it is therefore very important for us to retain significant revenueproducing employees and the key managerial and other professionals who support them we face numerous challenges in this regard including 

 

  

  

 losing employees who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements which would adversely affect our results of operations in addition if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 

  

our businesses face rapid technological changes and our failure to adequately anticipate or respond to these changes could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

to remain competitive in many of our business areas we must identify the most current technologies and methodologies and integrate them into our service offerings for example guy carpenter’s riskmodeling services are increasingly dependent on implementing advanced software and datacompilation tools kroll’s ediscovery business depends on advanced search technology and computerized document processing and mercer’s ability to price its outsourcing services competitively is highly dependent on technology if we do not make the correct technology choices or investments or if our choices or investments are insufficiently prompt or costeffective our business and results of operations could suffer 

financial risks 

credit rating downgrades could negatively affect our financing costs and subject us to operational risk 

both moody’s and standard  poor’s downgraded mmc’s senior debt credit rating in late 2004 and sp announced a further downgrade in december 2007 currently mmc’s senior debt is rated baa2 by moody’s and bbb by sp these ratings are the nexttolowest investment grade rating for moody’s and the lowest investmentgrade rating for sp 

if we need to raise capital in the future for example in order to fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives any further credit rating downgrade could negatively affect our financing costs and likely would limit our access to financing sources further we believe that a downgrade to a rating below investmentgrade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures 

our pension obligations may cause mmc’s earnings to fluctuate 

mmc has significant pension obligations to its current and former employees totaling approximately 10 billion at december 31 2007 the magnitude of our worldwide pension plans means that our earnings are comparatively sensitive to factors such as equity and bond market returns the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities rates of inflation and mortality assumptions variations in any of these factors could cause significant fluctuation in our earnings from year to year 

acquisitions and dispositions 

we face risks when we acquire and dispose of businesses 

we have a history of making acquisitions including our 19 billion acquisition of kroll in july 2004 and a total of 31 acquisitions in the period 20052007 for aggregate purchase consideration of 427 million we have also exited various businesses including putnam in august 2007 we expect that targeted acquisitions and dispositions will continue to be part of our business strategy our success in this regard will depend on our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition candidates and to complete with favorable results the transactions we decide to pursue 

while we intend that our acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability we cannot be certain that our past or future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations acquisitions involve special risks including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue profit or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect in addition if the operating performance of an acquired business deteriorates significantly we may need to write down the value of the goodwill and other acquisitionrelated intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet given the significant size of mmc’s goodwill and intangible assets a writedown of this sort could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given period as of december 31 2007 mmc’s consolidated balance sheet reflected 78 billion of goodwill and intangible assets representing approximately 45 percent of mmc’s total consolidated assets and allocated by reporting segment as follows risk and insurance services 38 billion consulting 19 billion and risk consulting  technology 17 billion 

  

when we dispose of businesses we are subject to the risk contractually agreed or otherwise of posttransaction liabilities for example as described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under part ii item 8 of this report we have retained certain contingent litigation liabilities relating to putnam 

risks relating to our risk and insurance services segment 

our risk and insurance services segment conducted through marsh and guy carpenter and including risk capital holdings represented 49 percent of mmc’s total operating segments revenue in 2007 our business in this segment is subject to particular risks 

volatility or declines in premiums and other market trends may significantly impede our ability to improve revenues and profitability 

a significant portion of our risk and insurance services revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage we have no control over premium rates and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to the general phenomenon of pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

for example for several years through late 2000 competition among insurers for market share and increased underwriting capacity helped create a socalled “soft market” in which premium rates were driven downward and marsh’s and guy carpenter’s commission revenues were pressured subsequently due in part to the events of september 11 2001 the insurance industry transitioned into a “hard market” in which premium rates increased these rate increases continued until 2005 at which point average us commercial propertycasualty rates began to decline on a yearoveryear basis according to industry sources these soft market conditions have continued and generally intensified through the end of 2007 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their riskprotection needs this trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to “selfinsure” the use of socalled “captive” insurers and the advent of capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance and reinsurance needs 

we may not be as successful as we hope in implementing marsh’s evolving business model and otherwise coping with changing modes of compensation in the insurance brokerage industry 

since late 2004 marsh has made significant changes to its business model including the elimination of market service agreements with insurers the elimination of market service revenue has negatively affected our financial results in 2004 we recognized market service revenue of 516 million relating to insurance placements made before october 1 2004 by contrast in 2005 2006 and 2007 respectively we recognized 114 million 43 million and 3 million of market service revenue relating to placements made before october 1 2004 

although aon and willis have similarly terminated the use of market service agreements many specialist regional and local insurance brokers have not to date there has been no regulatory action to end the use of market service arrangements throughout the brokerage industry and it is therefore unclear to what extent many of our competitors will continue to accept market service or contingent commission revenue it is possible that marsh will continue indefinitely to suffer competitive disadvantage compared to the brokers that have not given up the use of market service arrangements if that occurs marsh would continue to face pressure on its revenues operating margin and market share 

in addition to the possibility of continued competitive disadvantage as described above marsh faces risks relating to the implementation of its post2004 business model marsh currently seeks to increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that are disclosed to its clients and to generate profitable revenue growth by focusing on the provision of valueadded risk advisory services 

  

beyond traditional brokerage activities marsh’s current business and compensation model continues to evolve and in some respects remains untested we cannot be certain that it will generate the profitable revenue growth we are targeting the inability to derive adequate revenues from marsh’s current business and compensation model may significantly impede improvement in our operating results and profitability 

our operating income and margins in risk and insurance services may be affected by quarterly changes in the value of risk capital holdings’ investments in private equity funds 

through its risk and insurance services subsidiary risk capital holdings mmc owns among other investments minority interests in certain private equity funds risk capital holdings records as revenue its proportionate share of changes in the quarterly fair value of these funds’ underlying investments these changes in value the size and timing of which risk capital holdings generally does not control can have a significant effect on risk and insurance services revenue from one quarter to another in turn because a large proportion of risk capital holdings’ revenues flow directly to net operating income in risk and insurance services changes in the value of risk capital holdings’ private equity fund investments can have a significant effect on segment operating income and margins from quarter to quarter 

results in our risk and insurance services segment may be adversely affected by a general decline in economic activity 

demand for many types of insurance and reinsurance generally rises and falls as economic growth expands or slows this dynamic affects the level of commissions and fees generated by marsh and guy carpenter to the extent our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions they may choose to limit their purchases of insurance coverage which would inhibit our ability to generate commission revenue and may decide not to purchase our risk advisory services which would inhibit our ability to generate fee revenue moreover a growing number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business 

risks relating to our consulting and risk consulting and technology segments 

our consulting segment conducted through mercer and oliver wyman group represented 43 percent of our total operating segments revenue in 2007 our risk consulting and technology segment conducted through kroll represented 9 percent of our total operating segments revenue in 2007 our businesses in these two segments are subject to particular risks 

demand for our services might decrease for various reasons including a general economic downturn a decline in a client’s or an industry’s financial condition or changes in government regulation 

our consulting and risk consulting and technology segments generally have achieved significant revenue growth over the last three years despite this history however we cannot be certain that demand for our consulting and risk consulting and technology services will continue to grow the evolving needs or financial circumstances of our clients also may challenge our ability to increase revenues and profitability in particular economic downturns affecting particular clients or industry groups could reduce demand for our services 

in addition demand for many of mercer’s benefits services is affected by government regulation and tax rules which drive our clients’ needs for benefitsrelated services for example significant changes in government regulations affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of mercer’s services 

  

our profitability may suffer if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and pricing rates for our consultants 

the profitability of our consulting and risk consulting and technology businesses depends in part on ensuring that our consultants maintain adequate utilization rates ie the percentage of our consultants’ working hours devoted to billable activities our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in recent periods we have maintained a utilization rate that is high by our historical standards we cannot be certain that we will maintain this level of utilization in future periods particularly if economic growth slows if the utilization rate for our consulting professionals were to decline our profit margin and profitability could suffer 

in addition the profitability of our consulting and risk consulting and technology businesses depends on the prices we are able to charge for our services our pricing power is affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for our consultants our profit margin and profitability could suffer 

our quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly 

quarterly variations in mercer’s oliver wyman group’s and kroll’s revenues and operating results may occur due to several factors these include 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

 a significant portion of total operating expenses at mercer oliver wyman group and kroll is relatively fixed therefore a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results for these businesses 

acceleration of the shift by employers from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans could adversely affect mercer’s operating results 

mercer currently provides clients with actuarial and consulting services relating to both defined benefit and defined contribution plans defined benefit pension plans generally require more services than defined contribution plans because defined benefit plans typically involve large asset pools complex calculations to determine employer costs funding requirements and sophisticated analysis to match liabilities and assets over long periods of time recent regulatory initiatives in the united states and certain european countries may result in companies either discontinuing or curtailing defined benefit programs in favor of defined contribution plans if organizations shift to defined contribution plans more rapidly than we anticipate and we do not successfully adjust our service offerings to take account of that change mercer’s operating results could be adversely affected

significant developments 

mmc’s financial results and financial position reflect among other items 

 

  

  

  

  

   

consolidated results of operations 

 

 consolidated operating income was 1 billion in 2007 a decrease of 136 million or 12 from the prior year 

an increase in consulting segment operating income of 30 to 606 million was more than offset by decreases in risk and insurance services and risk consulting and technology in addition corporate expenses increased 63 million over the prior year primarily due to a credit of 74 million in the prior year related to the gain on disposal of five floors in mmc’s new york headquarters building and 14 million of incremental compensation costs in the current year related to the departure of mmc’s former ceo 

consolidated net income increased to 25 billion in 2007 compared with 10 billion in the prior year resulting from a 19 billion gain on the disposal of putnam recorded in discontinued operations in 2006 the net gain from disposals of discontinued operations was 172 million primarily related to scms 

  

consolidated revenues and expenses 

mmc conducts business in many countries as a result of which the impact of foreign exchange rate movements may impact periodtoperiod comparisons of revenue similarly the revenue impact of acquisitions and dispositions may impact periodtoperiod comparisons of revenue underlying revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to another by isolating these impacts the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations acquisitions and dispositions on mmc’s operating revenues by segment is as follows 

 

  

  

 revenue 

consolidated revenue for 2007 increased 8 to 114 billion compared with 2006 reflecting a 4 increase in underlying revenue and a 4 positive impact of foreign currency translation 

revenue in the risk and insurance services segment increased 2 compared with 2006 underlying revenue decreased 1 for the total risk and insurance services segment reflecting a 1 increase in reinsurance services a 1 decrease in insurance services partially reflecting a 40 million decrease 

  

in market service revenue and a 16 decrease in risk capital holdings consulting revenue increased 16 resulting from an 11 increase in mercer’s businesses and 26 growth in the oliver wyman group businesses on an underlying basis revenue increased 7 in mercer 18 in oliver wyman group and 10 for the consulting segment in total revenue increased 2 in risk consulting  technology 1 on an underlying basis 

in 2006 risk and insurance services revenue decreased 2 compared with 2005 and was flat on an underlying basis a 5 increase in underlying revenue in reinsurance services was offset by a 2 decrease in insurance services partly resulting from a 71 million decline in market service revenue risk consulting  technology revenue increased 12 due to growth in kroll’s corporate advisory and restructuring technology services and security businesses consulting revenue increased 11 resulting from a 19 increase in the oliver wyman group businesses and an 8 increase at mercer 

operating expenses 

consolidated operating expenses in 2007 increased 10 compared with 2006 operating expenses increased 5 on an underlying basis in 2007 compared with 2006 the increase in underlying expenses is due to higher compensation and benefit costs driven by consulting due to increased volume across all operating companies increased advertising primarily in insurance services and favorable professional liability experience in 2006 

consolidated operating expenses in 2006 decreased 1 from 2005 the decrease in operating expenses reflects cost savings from restructuring activities a decrease in net restructuring and related charges lower settlement legal and regulatory costs related to proceedings involving mmc and certain of its subsidiaries and lower costs related to employee retention awards partly offset by higher compensation costs primarily in the consulting segment due to increased headcount and higher incentive compensation expenses in 2006 also reflect lower costs related to professional liability claims these decreases in 2006 were partly offset by higher expenses related to stock options due to the adoption of sfas 123r on july 1 2005 expenses related to stock options were recorded for only six months in 2005 while 2006 includes stock option expense for the full year in 2006 the costs related to stock options are included in segment results in 2005 the costs related to stock options are included in corporate 

restructuring and related activities 

mmc initiated restructuring activities in the first quarter of 2005 the “2005 plan” and the third quarter of 2006 in 2007 we incurred net restructuring costs of 98 million and related charges of 21 million primarily accelerated amortization from actions taken under these restructuring plans the costs and annualized savings relating to the plans are discussed below 

2005 plan 

mmc’s actions under the 2005 plan are complete mmc is currently realizing annualized savings of approximately 400 million attributable to the 2005 plan relating primarily to the risk and insurance services segment in early 2006 mmc began implementing its plan to eliminate excess space in its corporate headquarters building in midtown new york costs related to its headquarters building incurred through june 30 2006 approximately 40 million and savings generated from those actions approximately 10 million were recognized as part of the 2005 plan 

2006 costsavings initiative 

in september 2006 mmc announced a costsavings initiative related to firmwide infrastructure organization structure and operating company business processes the first phase of this initiative began in september 2006 

as previously reported mmc’s actions under the first phase are substantially complete except for certain actions related to mmc’s headquarters building from inception through december 31 2007 mmc incurred total costs of 56 million related to the first phase consisting of 20 million of 

  

restructuring charges 10 million of which were incurred in 2007 and related charges totaling 36 million 21 million of which were incurred in 2007 primarily related to accelerated amortization of leasehold improvements the restructuring charges are net of a 74 million gain on the sale of 5 floors of mmc’s new york headquarters building recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006 the actions completed under this first phase of the 2006 costsavings initiatives have resulted in annualized savings of approximately 135 million 

separate from the 2006 costsavings initiative marsh identified actions that resulted in the elimination of approximately 170 employee positions through staff reductions and attrition these actions have resulted in annualized savings of approximately 40 million through december 31 2007 these actions by marsh have resulted in charges of 53 million 39 million of these charges were recorded in 2007 

in the fourth quarter of 2007 marsh took additional actions that resulted in the elimination of 84 positions and annualized savings of 12 million these actions resulted in charges of 16 million for severance and related benefits 

putnam transaction 

on august 3 2007 greatwest lifeco inc completed its purchase of putnam investments trust for 39 billion in cash the purchase includes putnam’s interest in the th lee private equity business after the payment of taxes in december 2007 the cash proceeds to mmc after minority interest approached 25 billion the transaction resulted in a pretax gain of 30 billion 19 billion after tax which is included in discontinued operations putnam’s results of operations through august 2 2007 and results for prior years are included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income putnam’s assets and liabilities are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying balance sheet at december 31 2006 

other businesses exited 

during 2006 mmc completed the sale of several businesses scms in january 2006 price forbes in september 2006 and ksi in december 2006 the gain or loss on disposal of these businesses including any charges to reduce the carrying value to fair value less cost to sell are included in discontinued operations in 2006 

the operating results of each of the businesses through the date of sale or disposal are included in discontinued operations in 2005 except for the 2005 results of price forbes which were insignificant to mmc’s results for that year 

in 2005 marsh completed the sale of crump group inc the gain on disposal of crump as well as its results of operations through the date of disposal are included in discontinued operations in 2005 

risk and insurance services 

in the risk and insurance services segment mmc’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers agents or consultants for insureds insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management insurance broking and insurance program management services primarily under the name of marsh and engage in reinsurance broking catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions primarily under the name of guy carpenter risk capital holdings owns investments in private equity funds and insurance and financial firms 

marsh and guy carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients andor commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided the particular insurer or reinsurer the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients revenues are affected by premium rate levels in the insurancereinsurance markets the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insuredsreinsureds in many cases compensation may be negotiated in advance based on the types and amounts of risks to be analyzed by mmc and ultimately placed into the 

  

insurance market or retained by the client the trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next will therefore be affected by changes in premium rate levels fluctuations in client risk retention and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured as well as new and lost business and the volume of business from new and existing clients 

effective october 1 2004 marsh eliminated contingent compensation or market services agreements with insurers under which it had received revenues based upon such factors as the overall volume growth and in some cases profitability of the total business placed by marsh with a given insurer 

marsh and guy carpenter receive interest income on certain funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others the investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities these regulations typically provide for segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates both of which vary from time to time 

following the sale of mmc capital’s business in may 2005 we no longer receive fees in connection with the private equity investments previously managed by mmc capital nor do we receive management fees or origination fees related to this business except that mmc retained the right to receive certain performance fees relating to the trident ii private equity partnership we continue to receive dividends and to recognize capital appreciation or depreciation on the investments held by risk capital holdings as well as revenue on risk capital holdings’ sales of investments from time to time based on recent security market levels revenue for risk capital holdings is expected to continue to be volatile on a quartertoquarter basis and substantially lower in 2008 as compared to 2007 

the results of operations for the risk and insurance services segment are presented below 

 

 revenue 

revenue in risk and insurance services increased 2 in 2007 compared with 2006 reflecting the positive impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations partly offset by a 1 decrease in underlying revenue 

in insurance services revenue increased 3 from last year reflecting a 4 positive impact of currency translation and a 1 decrease in underlying revenue for the full year marsh’s new business production increased 5 on an underlying basis in 2007 compared with 2006 premium rate declines in the commercial insurance marketplace continued to accelerate during the year on a geographic basis marsh revenue included 24 billion in the americas 17 billion in emea and 388 million in asia pacific compared with 24 billion 16 billion and 348 million in the respective geographies in 2006 

reinsurance services revenue increased 2 in 2007 compared to 2006 and 1 on an underlying basis these results were achieved despite a significant decline in us property catastrophe rates as well as higher risk retentions by clients 

risk capital holdings’ revenue was 163 million in 2007 compared with 193 million in 2006 risk capital holdings’ revenue in 2007 relates primarily to marktomarket gains on private equity fund investments and gains from the sales of investments revenue from risk capital holdings is expected 

  

to continue to be volatile on a quartertoquarter basis and substantially lower in 2008 as compared to 2007 

effective january 1 2007 marsh managed certain businesses formerly part of risk consulting  technology which had revenue of 16 million in 2007 revenue from these businesses was 25 million in 2006 and is reflected as part of risk consulting  technology 

revenue in risk and insurance services decreased 2 in 2006 compared with 2005 and was flat on an underlying basis higher revenue in reinsurance services and risk capital holdings was offset by a decrease in insurance services 

in december 2006 mmc through its subsidiary risk capital holdings contributed its limited partnership interest in trident iii valued at 182 million to mmc’s uk pension fund the transaction was recorded at the estimated fair value of mmc’s investment on the date of the contribution risk capital holdings’ revenue in 2006 included 38 million of marktomarket gains for trident iii recognized through the date of the contribution 

expense 

expenses in the risk and insurance services segment increased 6 in 2007 over the prior year the increase in expenses reflects higher salary costs due to increased headcount during the second half of the year the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations costs associated with marsh’s advertising campaign initiated in the spring of 2007 incremental expenses related to the departure of marsh’s former ceo and the effect of favorable professional liability experience in 2006 these increases were partly offset by lower restructuring and related costs versus 2006 and reduced incentive compensation accruals 

in 2006 expenses in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 9 over the prior year the decrease reflects cost savings from restructuring a decrease in restructuring charges from 257 million in 2005 to 100 million in 2006 a decrease of 45 million in settlement legal and regulatory costs related to market services agreements and associated shareholder and policyholder litigation and a decrease of 78 million related to employee retention awards in addition 2006 expenses reflect lower incentive compensation costs and lower costs related to professional liability claims partly offsetting these decreases were costs of 47 million in 2006 related to employee stock options which were not charged to the segment in 2005 

consulting 

mmc conducts business in its consulting segment through two main business groups mercer includes practice groups specializing in retirement and investments outsourcing health and benefits and talent the oliver wyman group provides specialized management and economic and brand consulting services 

the major component of consulting’s revenue in both mercer and the oliver wyman group is fees paid by clients for advice and services mercer principally through its health  benefits line of business also earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group and occasionally individual insurance contracts primarily life health and accident coverages revenue for mercer’s discretionary investment management business and certain of mercer’s outsourcing business defined contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under administration 

revenue in the consulting segment is affected by among other things global economic conditions including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets revenue is also subject to competition due to the introduction of new products and services broad trends in employee demographics the effect of government policies and regulations and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates revenues from the provision of discretionary investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by securities market performance 

  

the results of operations for the consulting segment are presented below 

 

 revenue 

consulting revenue in 2007 increased 16 compared with 2006 comprising 11 growth at mercer and 26 growth at oliver wyman group revenue for the segment increased 10 on an underlying basis within mercer the revenue increase of 11 reflects growth in retirement and investment of 13 health and benefits of 6 outsourcing of 15 and talent of 10 mercer grew 7 on an underlying basis the oliver wyman group grew 26 or 18 on an underlying basis compared with the same period last year management economic and brand consulting all produced double digit growth 

consulting revenue in 2006 increased 11 compared with 2005 revenue for mercer increased 8 or 7 on an underlying basis driven by strong growth in retirement and investments and talent oliver wyman group revenues grew 19 16 on an underlying basis each of the oliver wyman group practices contributed to this performance led by management consulting which increased underlying revenues 18 

expense 

consulting expenses increased 14 in 2007 compared with 2006 reflecting higher compensation costs due to an increased volume of business higher incentive compensation commensurate with improved operating performance and the impact of foreign currency translation 

consulting expenses increased 12 in 2006 compared with 2005 the expense increase reflects restructuring charges of 27 million the impact of acquisitions and higher compensation costs due in part to increased staff levels in addition expenses in 2006 include costs of 41 million related to employee stock options which were not charged to the segment in 2005 

risk consulting  technology 

mmc’s risk consulting  technology segment primarily consists of kroll and its subsidiaries kroll services fall into two major product lines consulting services which includes risk consulting corporate advisory  restructuring and security and technology enabled solutions 

kroll receives compensation primarily in the form of fees paid by clients these fees are typically earned on an hourly project fixed fee or perunit basis kroll’s revenue is subject to changes in international economic and regulatory conditions some of kroll’s revenue sources are countercyclical to the performance of the economy in general these sources may include for example fees from restructuring turnaround and forensic engagements relating to commercial bankruptcies and bond defaults kroll is also subject to normal competitive forces such as pricing pressures demand for professional staff and new product development on the part of competitors particularly in technology services 

  

the results of operations for the risk consulting  technology segment are presented below 

 

 revenue 

risk consulting and technology revenues increased 2 compared with 2006 and 1 on an underlying basis revenue in kroll’s technology operations rose 13 to 569 million led by the kroll ontrack legal technology unit and kroll’s background screening business revenues in kroll’s consulting business decreased 10 to 426 million the decline in kroll’s consulting revenue reflects continued weak demand for kroll’s corporate restructuring services including lower client success fees for completed engagements compared with 2006 

risk consulting  technology revenues increased 12 in 2006 compared with 2005 and 9 on an underlying basis the technology services group kroll’s largest business unit increased revenues by 12 

effective january 1 2007 kroll transferred to marsh certain businesses which had revenue of 25 million in 2006 revenue for the risk consulting and technology segment in 2006 has not been restated for this transfer 

in the fourth quarter of 2006 kroll completed the sale of ksi an international security operation that provided highrisk asset and personal protection services the financial results of ksi are included in discontinued operations and are not included in the segment’s results for any year presented 

expense 

risk consulting and technology expenses in 2007 increased 7 compared with 2006 partially due to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations the increase reflects higher compensation related to the increased volume of business for kroll’s ontrack and background screening operations as well as higher compensation in the corporate advisory and restructuring business to retain key professional staff in anticipation of future increased activity also expenses in 2006 included a credit related to the early termination of a licensing agreement 

risk consulting  technology expenses increased 11 in 2006 compared with 2005 approximately half of the increase results from acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency fluctuation the remaining increase reflects higher compensation in the corporate advisory and restructuring and the background screening businesses as well as increased costs for outside services in the background screening business due to a higher volume of business the increases discussed above are partly offset by a credit in 2006 related to the early termination of a licensing agreement 

discontinued operations 

results of discontinued operations includes the gain on the sale of putnam as well as putnam’s operating income through august 2 2007 and the operating income from putnam scms ksi and price forbes for 2006 and 2005 the gain on the disposal of crump and crump’s operating income are included in discontinued operations in 2005 in addition discontinued operations in 2006 also includes the gain on disposal of scms and a charge to reduce the carrying value of price forbes’ assets to fair value 

  

the following depicts the results of discontinued operations including revenue and expense detail for putnam 

 

 mmc’s gain on the putnam transaction increased diluted earnings per share 338 for the year ended december 31 2007 in 2006 discontinued operations included an aftertax net gain of 179 million related to the gain on disposal of scms and charges related to price forbes and ksi which increased diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2007 by approximately 032 

  

corporate items 

 

 

corporate expenses 

corporate expenses were 200 million in 2007 compared to 137 million in 2006 these costs include 42 million for restructuring and related charges in 2007 compared with a credit of 31 million of such items in 2006 that included a 74 million gain on the sale of five floors in mmc’s headquarters building in 2007 corporate expenses included incremental costs of 14 million related to the departure of mmc’s former ceo that were offset by a credit from an accrual adjustment related to the separation of former mmc senior executives 

corporate expenses of 137 million in 2006 were 150 million lower than in 2005 the decrease is primarily due to the impact of stock option expense which was recorded as a corporate charge in 2005 and was charged to the business segments in 2006 and lower net restructuring charges largely resulting from a gain on the disposal of five floors in mmc’s headquarters building partly offset by higher professional services fees 

interest 

interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to 95 million in 2007 an increase of 35 million from 2006 the increase in interest income reflects generally higher average interest rates in 2007 compared with 2006 and higher invested balances during the second half of the year resulting from the receipt of proceeds from the putnam transaction interest expense of 267 million in 2007 decreased from 303 million from 2006 the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to a decrease in the average level of debt compared to the prior year 

interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to 60 million in 2006 an increase of 16 million from 2005 the increase in interest income reflected the combination of higher average corporate cash balances and generally higher average interest rates in 2006 compared with the prior year interest expense of 303 million in 2006 decreased from 332 million in 2005 the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to 34 million recorded in the third quarter of 2005 for the prepayment charge incurred in connection with the refinancing of the mortgage on mmc’s headquarters building in new york 

income taxes 

mmc’s consolidated effective tax rate was 349 in 2007 compared to 298 in 2006 the change primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of international tax law changes in 2007 and the release of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in 2006 

mmc’s consolidated effective tax rate was 298 in 2006 compared to 314 in 2005 the change primarily reflects the release of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets partly offset by a change in the geographic mix of mmc’s earnings and an adjustment of the 2005 tax provision estimates to the tax return amount 

the effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of mmc’s earnings which may have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the rate furthermore losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations and may result in the need for valuation allowances against deferred taxes which would affect the rate 

mmc adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period subsequent changes in judgment resulting from new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue such adjustments could have a material impact on mmc’s effective tax rate net income and cash flows in a particular future period 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

mmc’s routine liquidity needs are primarily for current operating expenses capital expenditures servicing debt pension obligations paying dividends on outstanding stock and funding acquisitions as a holding company our primary source for meeting these requirements is cash flows from our operating subsidiaries other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities discussed below in financing cash flows 

cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheet as an offset to fiduciary liabilities fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for mmc 

operating cash flows 

mmc used 231 million of cash for operations in 2007 compared with generating 878 million in 2006 these amounts reflect the net income earned by mmc during those periods excluding gains or losses from the disposition of businesses and the gain on the sale of five floors from the mmc headquarters building adjusted for noncash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets payment of accrued liabilities in 2007 includes approximately 170 million for regulatory settlements and tax payments of 933 million related to the disposition of businesses primarily putnam comparable items in 2006 include payments of approximately 270 million for regulatory settlements and tax payments of 136 million related to the disposition of businesses although the cash proceeds from the putnam transaction are included in investing cash flows sfas 95 specifies that the related payment of taxes be included in operating cash flows and not allocated to other cash flow categories 

mmc has funding requirements for its us nonqualified and nonus pension plans in 2008 of approximately 20 million and 255 million respectively mmc’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable foreign law there currently is no erisa funding requirement for the us qualified plan in 2007 or in 2008 funding requirements for nonus plans vary by country contribution rates are determined by the local actuaries based on local funding practices and requirements funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in addition amounts funded in the future to the extent not due under regulatory requirements may be affected by alternative uses of mmc’s cash flows including dividends investments and share repurchases 

during 2007 mmc contributed approximately 20 million to the us pension plans and 189 million to the significant nonus pension plans compared with 20 million for us plans and 319 million for significant nonus plans in 2006 the contribution to the nonus plans in 2006 includes a noncash contribution of mmc’s investment in trident iii a private equity limited partnership the contribution was recorded based on the estimated fair value on the date of the contribution of 182 million 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas 158 sfas 158 requires that mmc recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans the “plans” as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability the offsetting adjustment to the amount of assets and liabilities required to be recognized is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in mmc’s 2006 yearend balance sheet subsequent changes in the funded status will be recognized through the income statement and other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur as appropriate mmc adopted the provisions of sfas 158 prospectively on december 31 2006 the impact of adopting sfas 158 resulted in a reduction in assets of 660 million and an increase in liabilities of 245 million including a related adjustment to tax benefits of 423 million the net impact of adopting sfas 158 was a reduction of mmc’s stockholders’ equity of 905 million in 2006 or 804 million including an adjustment for the impact of recording a reduction to the minimum pension liability prior to the adoption of sfas 158 in 2007 the improved funded status of the plans resulted in a net increase to equity of 708 million the change in funded status of the plans is impacted by numerous items including actual 

  

results compared with prior estimates and assumptions contributions to the plans and changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates in 2007 the funded status of mmc’s plans was significantly impacted by an increase in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31 2007 reflecting a general widening of credit spreads on high quality corporate debt obligations and by contributions and asset returns 

financing cash flows 

net cash used for financing activities was 26 billion in 2007 compared with 759 million of net cash used for financing activities in 2006 during 2007 mmc repurchased 13 billion of its common stock and reduced outstanding debt by approximately 11 billion these actions are discussed more fully below 

share repurchases

debt repayment 

during 2007 mmc utilized commercial paper and bank borrowings as well as cash on hand to manage liquidity including the funding of maturing bonds and the repurchase of shares in the first quarter of 2007 mmc’s 5375 fiveyear 500 million senior notes matured mmc’s threeyear floating rate 500 million senior notes matured in the third quarter of 2007 mmc used a portion of its proceeds from the putnam transaction to pay down outstanding commercial paper and revolving credit facility borrowings at december 31 2007 no commercial paper or revolving credit facility borrowings were outstanding 

mmc and certain of its foreign subsidiaries maintain a 12 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility subsidiary borrowings under the facility are unconditionally guaranteed by mmc the facility will expire in december 2010 there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at december 31 2007 

mmc’s senior debt is currently rated baa2 by moody’s and bbb by standard  poor’s mmc’s shortterm debt is currently rated p2 by moody’s and a3 by standard  poor’s mmc carries a stable outlook from both moody’s and standard  poor’s in december 2007 standard  poor’s lowered its rating on mmc’s longterm debt from bbb to bbb and lowered the rating on mmc’s shortterm debt from a2 to a3 

  

mmc also maintains other credit facilities guarantees and letters of credit with various banks primarily related to operations located outside the united states aggregating 265 million at december 31 2007 and 269 million at december 31 2006 there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at december 31 2007 

dividends 

mmc paid total dividends of 413 million in 2007 076 per share and 374 million 068 per share in 2006 

in january 2008 the board of directors approved an increase to mmc’s quarterly cash dividend to 20 cents per share from 19 cents paid previously 

investing cash flows 

net cash provided by investing activities amounted to 28 billion in 2007 primarily due to the putnam transaction this compares with 136 million of net cash used for investing activities in 2006 cash generated by the sale of scms totaled 326 million in 2006 cash used for acquisitions totaled 206 million in 2007 compared with 221 million in 2006 remaining deferred cash payments of approximately 32 million related to acquisitions completed in 2007 and prior years are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2007 cash provided by the sale of securities of 78 million in 2007 was partly offset by cash used to purchase investments of 44 million in 2006 cash used to purchase investments of 193 million was partly offset by the sale of securities of 118 million in 2007 

mmc’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software which amounted to 378 million in 2007 and 307 million in 2006 primarily relate to computer equipment purchases the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs 

mmc has committed to potential future investments of approximately 81 million in connection with its investments in trident ii and other funds managed by stone point capital llc the majority of mmc’s investment commitments for funds managed by stone point capital llc are related to trident ii the investment period for which is now closed for new investments any remaining capital calls for trident ii would relate to followon investments in existing portfolio companies or for management fees or other partnership expenses significant future capital calls related to trident ii are not expected although it is anticipated that trident ii will be harvesting its remaining portfolio in 2008 and thereafter the timing of any portfolio company sales and capital distributions is unknown and not controlled by mmc 

commitments and obligations 

mmc’s contractual obligations of the types identified in the table below were of the following amounts as of december 31 2007  

 

 the above does not include unrecognized tax benefits of 351 million accounted for under fin 48 as mmc is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities other than approximately 86 million that may become payable during 2008 the above does not include liabilities established under fin 45 as mmc is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities 

  

market risk and credit risk 

certain of mmc’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets 

interest rate risk and credit risk 

mmc has historically managed its net exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing a mixture of variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance mmc’s asset base during 2007 virtually all of mmc’s variable rate borrowings were repaid 

interest income generated from mmc’s cash investments as well as invested fiduciary funds will vary with the general level of interest rates 

mmc had the following investments subject to variable interest rates 

 

 these investments and debt instruments are discussed more fully in the aboveindicated notes to the consolidated financial statements 

based on the above balances if shortterm interest rates decrease by 10 or 45 basis points over the course of the year annual interest income including interest earned on fiduciary funds would decrease by approximately 14 million 

in addition to interest rate risk our cash investments and fiduciary fund investments are subject to potential loss of value due to counterparty credit risk to minimize this risk mmc and its subsidiaries invest pursuant to a board approved investment policy the policy mandates the preservation of principal and liquidity and requires broad diversification with counterparty limits assigned based primarily on credit rating and type of investment mmc carefully monitors its cash and fiduciary fund investments and will further restrict the portfolio as appropriate to market conditions the majority of cash and fiduciary funds are invested in shortterm bank deposits and liquid money market funds 

foreign currency risk 

the translated values of revenue and expense from mmc’s international risk and insurance services and consulting operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates the nonus based revenue that is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations is approximately 50 of total revenue note 17 details revenue by geographic area we periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business 

equity price risk 

mmc holds investments in public and private companies as well as in certain private equity funds managed by stone point capital publicly traded investments of 23 million are classified as available for sale under sfas no 115 nonpublicly traded investments of 43 million are accounted for using the cost method and 293 million are accounted for using the equity method under apb opinion no 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” the investments that are classified as available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of changes in market value which if determined to be other than temporary could result in realized impairment losses mmc periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements 

  

other 

a significant number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

management’s discussion of critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding mmc’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from those estimates 

legal and other loss contingencies 

mmc and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims lawsuits and proceedings gaap requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant management judgment is required to comply with this guidance mmc analyzes its litigation exposure based on available information including consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of these matters to assess its potential liability 

in addition to the extent that insurance coverage is available significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are expected under mmc’s various insurance programs 

retirement benefits 

mmc maintains qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for its eligible us employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for eligible nonus employees mmc’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable foreign laws 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans – an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132 r” “sfas 158” sfas 158 requires that mmc recognize the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans the “plans” as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” net of tax in mmc’s consolidated balance sheets mmc adopted the provisions of sfas 158 prospectively on december 31 2006 

the determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and assumed rate of salary increase significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements mmc believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate actuarial assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate based on its current assumptions mmc expects pension expense to decrease by approximately 200 million in 2008 and currently expects to contribute approximately 275 million to the plans during 2008 

during 2005 mmc made changes to the us pension plan that were designed to reduce mmc’s benefits costs going forward the changes which were effective january 1 2006 include changing the benefit formula from a final average salary to a career average salary as well as a change in the calculation for early retirement benefits during 2006 mmc made similar changes to its uk pension plans 

  

future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions future investment performance future assumptions and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans holding all other assumptions constant a halfpercentage point change in the rate of return and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the us and uk plans which comprise approximately 89 of total pension plan liabilities as follows 

 

 changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense because the longterm rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate 

mmc contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees the cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the united states is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire but is funded by mmc as incurred this postretirement liability is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets the key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

mmc’s tax rate reflects its income statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions on january 1 2007 mmc adopted the provisions of fin 48 to account for the uncertainty in income taxes accordingly mmc reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with fin 48 is a twostep process the first step involves recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on only the technical merits of the position the technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes legislative intent regulations rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 

uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition derecognition and measurement adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue prior to january 1 2007 mmc estimated its uncertain income tax obligations in accordance with sfas 109 and sfas 5 mmc recognizes interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

tax law requires items be included in mmc’s tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in 

  

the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements in assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly mmc evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance mmc also considers taxplanning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years if carryback is permitted under the appropriate tax law the underlying assumptions mmc uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account mmc’s recent performance the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible or creditable valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction 

fair value determinations 

investment valuation – mmc holds investments in both public and private companies as well as certain private equity funds the majority of the public investments are accounted for as available for sale securities under sfas no 115 certain investments primarily investments in private equity funds are accounted for using the equity method under apb opinion no 18 mmc periodically reviews the carrying value of its investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements mmc bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they relate to each investment fair value of investments in private equity funds is determined by the funds’ investment managers factors considered in determining the fair value of private equity investments include implied valuation of recently completed financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors performance multiples of comparable public companies restrictions on the sale or disposal of the investments trading characteristics of the securities and the relative size of the holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public market float in those instances where quoted market prices are not available particularly for equity holdings in private companies or formal restrictions limit the sale of securities significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate value of mmc’s investments mmc reviews with the fund manager the appropriateness of valuation results for significant private equity investments 

goodwill impairment testing – under sfas 142 mmc is required to assess goodwill and any indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred mmc performs the annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a market approach or a discounted cash flow model carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level mmc completed its 2007 annual review in the third quarter of 2007 and concluded that goodwill is not impaired the fair value estimates used in this assessment are dependent upon assumptions and estimates about the future profitability and other financial ratios of our reporting units as well as relevant financial data recent transactions and market valuations of comparable public companies if in the future the performance of our reporting units varies significantly from our projections or our assumptions or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units change the estimated fair value of our reporting units could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill 

  

sharebased payment 

effective july 1 2005 mmc adopted sfas 123r “sharebased payment” which requires among other things that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values in addition management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards as defined by sfas 123r 

as of december 31 2007 there was 34 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards the weightedaverage periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized is 14 years also as of december 31 2007 there was 289 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to mmc’s restricted stock restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards 

see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of sfas 123r 

new accounting pronouncements 

new accounting pronouncements are discussed in note 1 to mmc’s consolidated financial statements 

on january 1 2007 mmc adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions this interpretation requires that mmc recognize in its consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position as a result of the implementation of fin 48 mmc recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately 13 million which is accounted for as a reduction to the january 1 2007 balance of retained earnings the term “unrecognized tax benefits” in fin 48 primarily refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the guidelines of fin 48 including this increase mmc had approximately 272 million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning of 2007 of this total 218 million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective tax rate in any future periods mmc classifies interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions in the financial statements as income taxes the total gross amount of such accrued interest and penalties before any applicable federal benefit at january 1 2007 was 40 million see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of fin 48 and income taxes 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosures about fair value measurements the provisions of sfas 157 are effective as of the beginning of mmc’s 2008 fiscal year mmc does not expect the adoption of sfas 157 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas 159” sfas 159 permits an entity to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings sfas 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 the adjustment to reflect the difference between fair value and the carrying amount would be accounted for as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption mmc did not elect to adopt the fair value option for any financial assets or liabilities as of january 1 2008 

on december 4 2007 the fasb issued sfas 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “sfas 141r” and sfas 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements” “sfas 160” 

  

sfas 141r requires entities in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction establishes the acquisitiondate fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed and requires the acquirer to disclose all information needed by investors and other users to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 

sfas 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling or minority interest in a subsidiary is considered an ownership interest and accordingly requires all entities to report such interests in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements 

both standards are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 early adoption is not permitted

regulation 

  mmc’s activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under united states federal and state laws as well as laws of other countries in which mmc’s subsidiaries operate see item 1a “risk factors” below for a discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our businesses 

  risk and insurance services while laws and regulations vary from location to location every state of the united states and most foreign jurisdictions require insurance market intermediaries and related service providers such as insurance brokers agents and consultants reinsurance brokers managing general agents and third party administrators to hold an individual andor company license from a governmental agency or selfregulatory organization some jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locallyowned business entities in this case if mmc has no licensed subsidiary we may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction 

  beginning in january 2005 all european union member states were required to implement the insurance mediation directive this directive aims to apply consistent minimum professional standards to insurance intermediaries including a licensing system based on an assessment of factors such as professional competence financial capacity and professional indemnity insurance as member states of the european union adopt regulations to comply with the directive our insurance intermediary operations in the european union have become or will become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements in january 2005 as part of the implementation of the directive in the united kingdom the power and responsibilities of the financial services authority or fsa were expanded to include regulation of insurance and reinsurance intermediaries in the united kingdom 

  insurance authorities in the united states and certain other jurisdictions in which mmc’s subsidiaries do business including the fsa in the united kingdom also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others these laws and regulations typically provide for segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them 

  certain of mmc’s risk and insurance services activities are governed by other regulatory bodies such as investment securities and futures licensing authorities in the united states marsh and guy carpenter use the services of mmc securities corp an nasdregistered broker dealer and an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of mmc primarily in connection with investment bankingrelated services and advising on alternative risk financing transactions in the european union these businesses receive securities transfer services from another mmc subsidiary mmc securities ltd which is regulated by the fsa for the conduct of investment business in the united kingdom 

  in some jurisdictions insurancerelated taxes may be due either directly from clients or from the insurance broker in the latter case the broker customarily looks to the client for payment 

  risk consulting and technology certain of kroll’s risk consulting and investigative activities are licensed and regulated at the federal state and local level in the united states and abroad many of these activities also involve the use of data from outside sources including third party vendors and governmental records as a result changes in existing or the implementation of new laws and regulations particularly relating to privacy could interfere with kroll’s historical access to and use of such data substance abuse testing laboratories operated by a kroll subsidiary are certified on the federal level and licensed in a number of states 

  consulting certain of mercer hr’s retirementrelated consulting services are subject to pension law and financial regulation in many countries including by the securities and exchange commission or sec in the united states and the fsa in the united kingdom in addition the trustee services investment services including advice to individuals on the investment of personal pension assets and assumption of discretionary investment management responsibilities and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services provided by mercer human resource consulting and its 

subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to investment and securities regulations in various jurisdictions the benefits insurance consulting and brokerage services provided by mercer human resource consulting and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to the same licensing requirements and regulatory oversight as the insurance market intermediaries described above regarding our risk and insurance services businesses in the united states mercer human resource consulting and mercer management consulting use the services of mmc securities corp primarily in connection with the sale of retirement and employee benefit plans and investment banking services respectively 

  investment management virtually all aspects of putnam’s investment management business are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by various federal state and foreign regulatory authorities putnam’s activities are subject to regulation by the sec and other federal state and selfregulatory authorities in the united states by the fsa in the united kingdom by the financial services agency in japan and by the national securities regulatory authorities in certain other countries in which it does business the investment advisers act of 1940 the “advisers act” imposes numerous obligations on certain of putnam’s subsidiaries which are registered in the united states as investment advisers including recordkeeping operating and marketing requirements disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities the investment company act of 1940 the “1940 act” imposes similar obligations on the investment companies that are advised by putnam the sec is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the advisers act and the 1940 act ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration 

competitive conditions 

  mmc faces strong competition in all of its business segments from providers of similar products and services mmc also encounters strong competition throughout its businesses from both public corporations and private firms in attracting and retaining qualified employees 

  risk and insurance services mmc’s combined insurance and reinsurance broking services business is the world’s largest of its kind the principal bases upon which our insurance and reinsurance businesses compete include the range quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients mmc encounters strong competition in the risk and insurance services business from other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis from a large number of regional and local firms in the united states the european union and elsewhere from insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses including commercial and investment banks accounting firms and consultants that provide riskrelated services and products 

  certain insureds and groups of insureds have established programs of self insurance including captive insurance companies as a supplement or alternative to thirdparty insurance thereby reducing in some cases their need for insurance placements there are also many other providers of affinity group and private client services including specialized firms insurance companies and other institutions 

  the continuing impact of legal and regulatory proceedings concerning our insurance brokerage operations also could affect marsh’s competitive position these proceedings are discussed in more detail in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this report please also read our discussion of the risks associated with these proceedings and their impact under item 1a “risk factors” below 

  risk consulting and technology in risk consulting and technology we face competition from local regional national and international firms that provide similar services in the fields of accounting corporate advisory and restructuring services investigative and security services consulting and technology services kroll’s consulting services group faces competition from local regional national 

and international accounting firms and forensic accounting litigation support investigative and other specialist and consulting firms kroll’s corporate advisory  restructuring group faces competition from national and international accounting firms and specialist recovery firms kroll’s security group faces competition from international and local security firms government security contractors and architectural engineering firms kroll’s technology services group faces competition from small independent service providers and technology companies 

  consulting mmc’s consulting and hr outsourcing businesses face strong competition from other privately and publicly held worldwide and national companies as well as regional and local firms these businesses compete generally on the basis of the range quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients competitors include independent consulting and outsourcing firms as well as consulting and outsourcing operations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms 

  mercer investment consulting faces competition from many sources including multimanager services offered by other investment consulting firms and financial institutions mercer global investments mercer hr’s recently established multimanager business in particular faces significant competition from betterestablished rivals with greater experience in that market 

  in many cases clients have the option of handling the services provided by mercer internally without assistance from outside advisors 

  investment management putnam’s investment management business is highly competitive putnam competes with other providers of investment products and services primarily on the basis of the range of investment products offered investment performance distribution scope and quality of shareholder and other services and general reputation in the marketplace sales of putnam fund shares are also influenced by general securities market conditions government regulations global economic conditions and advertising and sales promotional efforts putnam competes with other mutual fund firms and institutional asset managers that offer investment products similar to putnam’s as well as products which putnam does not offer including passively managed funds such as index funds putnam also experiences competition from a number of mutual fund sponsors that offer their funds to the general public without sales charges which putnam does not do 

  many securities dealers whose large retail distribution systems play an important role in the sale of shares in the putnam funds also sponsor competing proprietary mutual funds to the extent that such securities dealers value the ability to offer customers a broad selection of investment alternatives they will continue to sell independent funds such as putnam’s notwithstanding the availability of proprietary products however to the extent that these firms limit or restrict the sale of putnam fund shares through their brokerage systems in favor of their proprietary mutual funds putnam’s assets under management and thus putnam’s revenues might decline

 item 1a risk factors 

  in addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the sec you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating mmc and its businesses the risks described below have the potential to materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

litigationrelated risks 

  continuing legal and regulatory proceedings concerning mmc may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  in january 2005 mmc and its subsidiary marsh entered into an agreement the “settlement agreement” with the new york state attorney general “nyag” and the new york state insurance department “nysid” to settle a civil complaint filed in new york state court by nyag in october 2004 the “nyag lawsuit” and a related citation the “citation” issued by nysid at approximately the same time among other things the nyag lawsuit and the citation had alleged that marsh’s use of market service agreements with various insurance companies entailed fraudulent business practices bidrigging illegal restraint of trade and other violations of the new york business and insurance statutes and was not adequately disclosed to marsh’s clients or mmc’s investors following the announcement of the nyag lawsuit and related actions taken by mmc mmc’s stock price dropped from approximately 45 per share to a low of approximately 2275 per share 

  pursuant to the settlement agreement mmc established a fund of 850 million payable over four years for policyholder clients in the us who placed insurance through marsh between 2001 and 2004 approximately 70000 eligible policyholders have elected to receive an aggregate distribution of approximately 750 million under this fund 

  notwithstanding the settlement agreement numerous other lawsuits have been commenced against us one or more of our subsidiaries and our current and former directors and officers relating to matters alleged in the nyag lawsuit numerous putative class action suits purportedly brought on behalf of policyholders and our shareholders against us certain of our subsidiaries and certain of our current and former officers and directors are pending in various federal and state courts and in canada shareholder derivative suits have been filed in various jurisdictions there are also several actions brought by individual policyholders and additional suits may be filed by other policyholders the myriad claims asserted in these suits include alleged violations of federal securities and antitrust laws erisa rico and other statutory and common law claims and seek significant damages in addition the states of connecticut and florida have brought lawsuits against mmc and marsh 

  further following the filing of the nyag lawsuit mmc and certain of its subsidiaries received notices of investigations and inquiries together with requests for documents and information from attorneys general departments of insurance and other governmental entities in a significant number of jurisdictions other than new york that relate to the allegations in the nyag lawsuit mmc also has been contacted by certain state attorneys general and commissioners of insurance indicating that they may seek additional monetary or other remedies from mmc 

  an adverse outcome under any of the lawsuits and regulatory actions involving mmc and its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the lawsuits and regulatory actions also could result in negative publicity reputational damage and harm to our client and employee relationships any of these developments could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  for further information about the above and other legal and regulatory matters involving mmc and its subsidiaries see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this report 

  mmc has agreed to retain specified liabilities of putnam the outcome of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

  on february 1 2007 we announced our agreement to sell putnam to greatwest lifeco inc which we expect to close in mid2007 under the stock purchase agreement relating to the sale mmc has agreed to indemnify greatwest lifeco inc for liabilities that may arise in connection with specified regulatory and litigation matters involving putnam including certain claims litigation or investigations relating to “excessive fees” or “markettiming” the matters for which mmc has retained indemnification obligations are more fully described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this report adverse outcomes in the matters for which mmc has retained indemnification obligations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

risks relating to our business model and operations 

  we may not be as successful as we hope in implementing marsh’s evolving business model 

  since 2004 marsh has made significant changes to its business model including the elimination of market service agreements with insurers the elimination of market service revenue has negatively affected our financial results in 2004 we recognized market service revenue of 516 million relating to insurance placements made before october 1 2004 in 2005 and 2006 respectively we recognized 114 million and 43 million of market service revenue relating to placements made before october 1 2004 

  under mmc’s current business model marsh seeks to increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that are disclosed to its clients and to generate profitable revenue growth by focusing on the provision of valueadded risk advisory services beyond traditional brokerage activities marsh’s current business and compensation model continues to evolve and in some respects remains untested we cannot be certain that it will generate the profitable revenue growth we are targeting the inability to derive adequate revenues from marsh’s current business and compensation model may significantly impede improvement in our operating results and profitability 

  we may not achieve all the cost savings and operational improvements we expect from our september 2006 restructuring initiative and other changes to our mmcwide operating model 

  in september 2006 we announced a series of restructuring and other initiatives designed to enhance mmc’s operational efficiency and improve our profitability these initiatives which involve information technology real estate corporate functions and operating company business processes are expected to yield annualized savings of approximately 350 million by the end of 2008 with associated charges of approximately 225 million we cannot be certain that we will achieve our targeted cost savings and operational improvements on the announced timetable or at all if we do not the impact of the 2006 restructuring initiatives on our operating margin will not be as significant as we currently expect 

  in addition mmc believes that future revenue growth will partly depend on increased collaboration among mmc’s operating companies in accessing their respective client bases similarly mmc believes that improvements to its future operating efficiency will depend on its ability to rationalize and consolidate business processes and infrastructure across the entire company our attempt to achieve these goals entails risks because mmc due in part to its history of growth through acquisitions has not traditionally operated in the integrated fashion that management currently envisions for example to achieve the above goals we must improve and rationalize our technology infrastructure standardize a variety of business operational functions develop increasingly scalable services improve our ability to market services across our operating companies create compensation systems that track 

and reward crossbusiness collaboration and market mmc’s brands in a more unified manner any inability to execute these changes may significantly impede improvement in our operating results and profitability 

  we are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from “errors and omissions” claims 

  mmc’s operating companies provide numerous services for clients around the world for example marsh advises on and places insurance coverage and sometimes provides related services such as risk management advice and claims management and collections guy carpenter performs similar services in its role as a reinsurance broker mercer renders a variety of consulting and investment management services as a result of these and other activities mmc operating companies are potentially subject to errors and omissions or eo claims by clients and third parties who may allege that they were damaged as a result of mmc’s failure to perform its duties as expected mmc works hard to minimize its potential eo exposures by among other things prevention and remediation efforts and employee educationtraining but it is not possible to prevent eo exposures completely when eo claims do arise claimants often seek monetary damages in the case of marsh and guy carpenter claimants may allege losses representing the value of insurance or reinsurance coverage lost due to broker negligence in the case of mercer claimants may allege losses due to negligent investment or consulting advice 

  eo claims in any given case can be significant and may subject mmc in addition to potential liability for monetary damages to reputational harm and diversion of personnel and management resources since 2001 the worldwide market for professional liability insurance for eo claims in the financial services industry has contracted significantly which has caused mmc to assume increasing levels of selfinsurance for its potential eo exposures mmc uses internal actuarial and other estimates and caselevel reviews by inside and outside counsel to establish loss reserves which it believes are adequate to provide for this selfinsured retention these reserves are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant nevertheless given the unpredictability of eo claims and of litigation which could flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on mmc’s financial condition or results of operations in a given quarterly or annual period for further information about our eo exposure and related insurance coverage including selfinsurance see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements appearing under item 8 of this report 

  credit rating downgrades could negatively affect our financing costs if we need to raise additional capital 

  mmc’s credit rating was lowered following the filing of the nyag lawsuit in october 2004 and both moody’s and standard  poor’s currently have mmc on a negative credit outlook if we need to raise capital in the future for example in order to fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives any further credit rating downgrade could negatively affect our financing costs or access to financing sources 

  we may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire 

  we have a history of numerous acquisitions including our 19 billion acquisition of kroll in july 2004 nine acquisitions in 2005 for total consideration of 68 million and 16 acquisitions in 2006 for total consideration of 200 million we expect that acquisitions will continue to be a part of our growth strategy 

  acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue profit or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect in addition acquisitions involve special risks including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and difficulties in integrating acquired 

businesses while we intend that our acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability we cannot be certain that our past or future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations 

  we are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations 

  we do business worldwide and we plan to expand our operations further into asia and other foreign markets this subjects us to significant legal economic operational and market risks these risks include among others 

the economic and political conditions in foreign countries   the imposition of local investment or other restrictions by foreign governments   potential costs and difficulties in complying or monitoring compliance with rules relating to trade sanctions administered by the us office of foreign assets control the requirements of the us foreign corrupt practices act and the rules thereunder or other us laws and regulations applicable to business operations abroad   the imposition of controls or limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies or remittance of dividends and other payments from foreign subsidiaries   the imposition of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments from subsidiaries   difficulties in monitoring employees in geographically dispersed locations and   potential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations administered by foreign government agencies   some of our subsidiaries in foreign countries receive revenue that differs from their functional currencies also we generally must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars although we may use derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse effects due to exchange rate fluctuations we cannot eliminate these risks and significant changes in exchange rates may have an adverse effect on our financial results 

competitive risks 

  each of our businesses operates in a highly competitive environment 

  we encounter strong competition for talent in our risk and insurance services business this competition comes from other insurance brokerage firms which also operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis from a large number of regional and local firms throughout the world from insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses that provide riskrelated services our consulting and risk consulting and technology businesses compete with independent consulting firms and organizations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms around the world and experience significant competition for talent any inability to respond successfully to this competition could have a material negative impact on our business or results of operations 

  in addition growing competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us these developments include 

the selling of insurance by insurance companies directly to insureds without the involvement of a broker or other market intermediary   changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory investigations 20 

an increase in competition from existing or recentlyformed insurance brokers who have not agreed to limit their use of market service arrangements thereby giving them a competitive advantage over those brokers such as marsh which have agreed to limit the use of such arrangements   the establishment of programs in which statesponsored entities provide property insurance or reinsurance or other alternative types of coverage in catastropheprone areas and   the creation of inhouse servicing capabilities by insurance companies or by certain insurance consumers which compete with the third party administration and other administration servicing and risk management products offered by our consulting and risk consulting and technology segments   increased competition as a result of these developments could cause the supply of and demand for our products and services to change which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  we may experience loss of key personnel and clients 

  across all of our businesses we must preserve our capabilities to serve clients and the capacity to support staff development retention of our employees therefore is critical to us and the loss of key managerial personnel or significant revenue producers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations since late 2004 we have developed compensation programs to retain motivate and reward certain key employees but we cannot be certain of our ability to retain our key employees or attract similar new employees in the future in addition as a result of the recent legal and regulatory matters referred to above under “litigationrelated risks” as well as marsh’s newly competitive business environment we may lose important clients or experience difficulty in generating new business in that event our business or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

regulatory risks 

  actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business 

  our activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under the laws of the united states and its various states the european union and the european and other countries in which our subsidiaries operate some of this regulation has only recently been instituted for example in january 2005 as part of the united kingdom’s implementation of the eu insurance mediation directive our insurance and reinsurance services activities in the united kingdom came under the jurisdiction of the financial services authority many of our businesses depend on the validity of and continued good standing under the licenses and approvals pursuant to which they operate as well as compliance with applicable regulations 

  in all jurisdictions applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities generally such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations licenses may be denied or revoked for various reasons including the violation of such regulations conviction of crimes and similar matters possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in a particular business for specified periods of time revocation of licenses censures redress to clients and fines in some instances we follow practices based on our interpretations or those generally followed by the industry of laws or regulations which may prove to be different from those of regulatory authorities accordingly the possibility exists that we may be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction 

  21 

  we cannot be certain that our risk and insurance services consulting and risk consulting and technology activities will continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as they have been in the past any significant impairment of our ability to conduct our business as we historically have done could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations for further information about regulatory conditions affecting our business segments see item 1 “business” of this report 

risks related to the risk and insurance services business 

  volatility or declines in premiums and other trends in the insurance and reinsurance markets may significantly impede our ability to generate improved revenue growth and profitability 

  mmc’s risk and insurance services segment represented 45 of our total operating segment revenue in 2006 we derive much our revenue in that segment from fees paid by clients and commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance providers we do not determine the insurance premiums on which much of our revenues are based and these premiums may vary widely over market cycles or across coverage types or geographic locations conditions for example for several years through late 2000 heavy competition for market share among insurance carriers increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations resulted in flat or reduced premium rates a “soft” market which in turn put downward pressure on marsh’s and guy carpenter’s commission revenue in many lines and in many geographic areas the insurance industry then transitioned to a “hard” market in which premium rates were stable or increasing particularly following the events of september 11 th  since 2004 the market has again softened in many lines and in geographic areas although within that general pattern an unusually high incidence of hurricanes and other natural disasters periods has hardened the market in certain geographic areas and business lines because of these market fluctuations which mmc cannot predict or control revenues and profitability in our risk and insurance services segment may be volatile or subject to downward pressure 

  in addition we may continue to witness trends toward the development of alternative insurance markets which deprive brokers of the opportunity to generate premiumbased revenue these trends include greater levels of selfinsurance by corporations and other entities the use of “captive” insurers and the advent of capital marketsbased solutions to traditional insurance needs while marsh and guy carpenter historically have been able to participate in some of these activities on behalf of their customers and have obtained fee revenue for such services the continuation of trends like the foregoing may impede our ability to improve revenues and profitability in our risk and insurance services segment 

risks related to the consulting and risk consulting and technology businesses 

  in addition to engaging in the risk and insurance services industry through marsh and guy carpenter mmc participates significantly in the consulting industry and related activities our consulting segment consisting of mercer hr and mercer specialty represented 35 of our total operating segment revenue in 2006 and our risk consulting and technology segment consisting of kroll contributed 8 these businesses entail their own risks 

  demand for mercer’s and kroll’s services may decrease for various reasons including a general economic downturn or a decline in a client’s or an industry’s financial condition 

  we cannot be certain that demand for our consulting and risk consulting and technology services will continue to grow or that we will compete successfully with existing or new competitors demand for our services also may change based on the evolving needs or financial circumstances of our clients economic downturns affecting particular clients or industry groups could reduce demand for our services and increase price competition 

  in addition the demand for many of mercer hr’s benefits services is affected by government regulation and taxation of employee benefits plans this regulation and taxation drive our clients’ needs for compliancerelated services significant changes in tax or social welfare policy or regulations could lead some employers to discontinue their employee benefit plans including defined benefit pension plans thereby reducing the demand for our services a simplification of regulations or tax policy also could reduce the need for our services 

  our results may suffer if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and suitable billing rates for our consultants 

  in many cases mercer’s and kroll’s clients are free to terminate our engagements at any time if clients reduce the scope of or terminate the use of our services with little or no notice our consultant utilization rate might decline in that case we must rapidly redeploy our consultants to other engagements in order to minimize the potential negative impact on our financial performance moreover because a significant portion of our work is projectbased rather than recurring in nature our consultants’ utilization depends on our ability to continually secure additional engagements 

  in addition our profitability at mercer and kroll is largely a function of the rates we are able to charge for our services and the staffing costs for our personnel accordingly if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or appropriate staffing costs of our personnel we will not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer the prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors including 

clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services   market demand for the services we provide   our ability to develop new services and the introduction of new services by competitors   the pricing policies of our competitors and   general economic conditions   if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate overall utilization as well as maintain or increase the billing rates for our consultants our financial results could materially suffer 

  quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly in our consulting and risk consulting and technology segments 

  quarterly variations in mercer’s and kroll’s revenues and operating results may occur due to several factors these include 

the significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter   the unpredictability of the timing and amount of success fees particularly at kroll   the possibility that clients may decide to delay or terminate a current or anticipated project as a result of factors unrelated to our work product or progress   fluctuations in consultant hiring and utilization rates and clients’ ability to terminate engagements without penalty   the success of strategic acquisitions alliances or investments and   general economic conditions since results of operations in our consulting businesses are directly affected by the level of business activity of our clients which in turn are affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve   in addition a significant portion of total operating expenses at mercer and kroll is relatively fixed therefore a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results for these businesses 

  acceleration of the shift by employers from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans could adversely affect mercer hr’s operating results 

  mercer hr currently provides clients with actuarial and consulting services relating to both defined benefit and defined contribution plans defined benefit pension plans generally require more services than defined contribution plans because defined benefit plans typically involve large asset pools complex calculations to determine employer costs funding requirements and sophisticated analysis to match liabilities and assets over long periods of time if organizations shift to defined contribution plans more rapidly than we anticipate and we do not adjust our service offerings to take account of that change mercer hr’s operating results could be adversely affected

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

general 

marsh  mclennan companies inc and subsidiaries “mmc” is a global professional services firm mmc’s subsidiaries include marsh inc “marsh” which provides risk and insurance services guy carpenter  company llc “guy carpenter” which provides reinsurance services kroll inc “kroll” which provides risk consulting and technology services mercer inc “mercer” which provides human resource and specialty consulting services and putnam investments “putnam” which provides investment management services mmc’s approximately 55000 employees worldwide provide analysis advice and transactional capabilities to clients in over 100 countries 

mmc operates in four principal business segments based on the services provided risk and insurance services includes risk management and insurance and reinsurance broking and services provided primarily by marsh and guy carpenter risk consulting  technology conducted through kroll includes risk consulting and related investigative intelligence financial security and technology services consulting which comprises the activities of mercer human resource consulting and mercer’s specialty consulting businesses includes human resource consulting and related services and specialized management and economic consulting services we conduct investment management through putnam please see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements which discusses mmc’s agreement to sell putnam to greatwest lifeco inc a fuller description of our segments’ business activities is included in part i item 1 of this report 

we describe the primary sources of revenue and categories of expense for each segment below in our discussion of segment financial results management evaluates performance based on segment operating income which reflects expenses directly related to segment operations but not mmc corporatelevel expenses a reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is included in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report the accounting policies used for each segment are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements 

this mda contains forwardlooking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 see “information concerning forwardlooking statements” at the outset of this report 

significant developments in 2006 

mmc’s historical financial information should be viewed in light of the significant developments discussed below 

as described more fully below results of operations in 2006 reflect among other items 

stock option expense under sfas 123r “sharebased payment” which mmc adopted effective july 1 2005 mmc’s 2006 results include stock option expense in each segment for the full year the 2005 results reflect a charge for six months from the date of adoption on july 1 2005 recorded in corporate expenses 

restructuring savings and charges under mmc’s 2005 and 2006 restructuring plans 

the sale of sedgwick claims management services in the first quarter of 2006 the gain from which appears in discontinued operations 

the sale of price forbes mmc’s ukbased wholesale brokerage business in the third quarter of 2006 the loss from which net of current year earnings is included in discontinued operations 

the sale of kroll security international “ksi” kroll’s international highrisk asset and personal protection division in the fourth quarter of 2006 the gain from which net of current year operating loss is included in discontinued operations and 

the continuing decline in market service revenues in the risk and insurance services segment 

  consolidated operating income in 2006 increased 71 to 15 billion resulting from a 3 increase in operating revenue and a 2 decrease in operating expenses revenue increases in consulting and risk consulting  technology were partly offset by decreases in risk and insurance services and investment management the decrease in operating expenses reflects cost savings from restructuring activities reduced net restructuring and related charges as well as lower costs related to several significant expense items discussed in more detail below under “consolidated revenue and expense” these expense savings were partly offset by incremental costs primarily related to stock options under sfas 123r 

results from discontinued operations in 2006 were 172 million net of tax primarily resulting from the gain on the sale of sedgwick claims management services in january 2006 in the third quarter of 2006 mmc completed the sale of price forbes its ukbased wholesale insurance broker the loss on the disposal of price forbes and net income associated with its 2006 results are included in discontinued operations the results of price forbes were insignificant to mmc’s 2005 results and therefore prior year amounts have not been restated in the fourth quarter of 2006 kroll completed the sale of kroll security international “ksi” its international highrisk asset and personal protection division the gain on the disposal of ksi and the financial results associated with 2006 and prior periods are included in discontinued operations

operating expenses 

consolidated operating expenses in 2006 decreased 2 from 2005 the decrease in operating expenses reflects cost savings from restructuring activities a decrease in net restructuring and related charges lower settlement legal and regulatory costs related to proceedings involving mmc and certain of its subsidiaries and lower costs related to employee retention awards partly offset by higher compensation costs primarily in the consulting segment due to increased headcount and higher incentive compensation expenses in 2006 also reflect lower amortization of prepaid dealer commissions and lower costs related to professional liability claims expenses in 2005 include a charge of 37 million for putnam’s estimate of costs to address issues relating to the calculation of certain amounts previously paid to putnam by the putnam mutual funds in the form of cost reimbursements to putnam for transfer agency services relating to defined contribution operations these decreases in 2006 were partly offset by higher expenses related to stock options due to the adoption of sfas 123r on july 1 2005 the prior year includes expenses related to stock options for only six months while 2006 includes stock option expense for the full year in 2006 the costs related to stock options are included in segment results in 2005 the costs related to stock options are included in corporate 

consolidated operating expenses in 2005 decreased 4 from 2004 this was primarily due to savings from restructuring initiatives and lower regulatory and other settlement expenses partly offset by employee retention costs the impact of acquisitions higher benefits costs and incremental costs primarily related to stock options resulting from the implementation of sfas 123 r in addition putnam’s expenses in 2005 include a charge of 37 million for the estimated cost necessary to address issues relating to the calculation of certain amounts previously paid to putnam by the putnam mutual funds in the form of cost reimbursements to putnam for transfer agency services relating to defined contribution operations expenses in 2004 include an 850 million charge related to the nyagnysid settlement costs of 224 million related to putnam’s settlement and agreements with the sec and office of the secretary of the commonwealth of massachusetts and restructuring costs of 337 million partly offset by a 105 million credit from the final insurance settlement related to world trade center losses 

restructuring and related activities 

mmc initiated restructuring activities in the first quarter of 2005 the “2005 plan” and the third quarter of 2006 the “2006 plan” in 2006 we incurred net restructuring costs of 87 million and related charges of 38 million from actions taken under these restructuring plans the costs and annualized savings relating to the plans are discussed below 

2005 plan 

mmc’s actions under the 2005 plan are complete mmc is currently realizing annualized savings of approximately 400 million attributable to the 2005 plan relating primarily to the risk and insurance services segment in early 2006 mmc began implementing its plan to eliminate excess space in its corporate headquarters building in midtown new york “headquarters building” costs related to its headquarters building incurred through june 30 2006 approximately 40 million and savings generated from those actions approximately 10 million were recognized as part of the 2005 plan 

2006 plan 

in september 2006 mmc announced cost savings initiatives related to firmwide infrastructure organization structure and operating company business processes which are expected to result in annualized savings of approximately 350 million when fully implemented by the end of 2008 and result in restructuring charges and related costs of approximately 225 million the cost savings 

initiatives are expected to be implemented in several phases – phase 1 began in september 2006 with several additional phases to follow the discussion below identifies the areas impacted and savings expected from various phases of the 2006 plan 

phase 1 of the 2006 plan is expected to result in cost savings of 160 million the expected savings from this phase comprise 70 million from operating company process improvements and 90 million from corporate infrastructure and process improvements in it real estate and corporate functions staff reductions of more than 750 are expected during 2006 mmc recorded a net charge of 10 million in connection with actions taken under phase 1 that includes a 74 million gain on the sale of five floors in mmc’s headquarters building more than offset by costs primarily related to severance and exit costs for facilities through december 2006 the actions under phase 1 are expected to result in annualized savings of approximately 110 million beginning in the first quarter of 2007 these actions under phase 1 are expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2007 except for certain actions related to mmc’s headquarters building discussed below 

as part of its ongoing review of operations marsh has identified additional actions that are expected to result in the reduction of 170 positions “phase 2” these actions are expected to increase the expected annualized savings from the 2006 plan by approximately 40 million and result in additional charges of approximately 40 million related to severance and exit costs for facilities in the fourth quarter of 2006 mmc incurred costs of 14 million related to this second phase of the 2006 plan 

mmc currently expects additional annualized savings of 190 million under one or more future phases of the 2006 plan resulting from infrastructure improvements in information technology procurement human resources finance and real estate as well as organizational structure and business process improvements detailed plans relating to these future phases are not yet complete and may impact the amount of expected savings expected costs or both that will result from these planned actions savings from these additional phases are expected to be realized as the actions are implemented through the end of 2008 

as noted above mmc has been reducing its occupancy at its headquarters building in new york phase 1 of the 2006 plan includes net costs of 8 million and expected annualized savings of approximately 25 million related to these actions the expected net costs of 8 million comprise both gains on the sale of owned floors and losses on subleases of leased floors which will be recognized at the earlier of when the floors are vacated or when sublease agreements are executed during the fourth quarter of 2006 mmc sold its condominium interest in five floors of its headquarters building realizing a gain of 74 million the disposal of these floors is an integral part of mmc’s overall restructuring plan and the gain from this disposal has been included as a reduction of other operating expenses consistent with the classification of other costs for actions taken related to this and other facilities mmc has vacated the sale of the five floors will reduce mmc’s annual facilities costs by approximately 5 million which is included in the 110 million of savings from phase 1 of the 2006 plan as discussed above 

mmc expects to vacate an additional seven floors five of which it leases and expects to sublease and two of which it owns and expects to lease to a third party additional costs of 60 million are expected from these remaining actions which are expected to generate annualized savings of 20 million when completed over the next 1218 months 

businesses exited in 2006 and 2005 

in december 2006 kroll completed the sale of ksi its international security operation that provided highrisk asset and personal protection services the financial results of ksi are included in discontinued operations 

in the first quarter of 2006 mmc determined that price forbes its ukbased insurance wholesale operation met the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation the 2006 results of price forbes which includes a charge to reduce the carrying amount of its assets to fair value less cost to 

sell are included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of income the prior year’s amounts have not been restated because the results of price forbes were insignificant to mmc’s 2005 results mmc completed the sale of price forbes in september 2006 

in october 2005 marsh completed the sale of crump group inc its usbased wholesale insurance broker the gain on the sale was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2005 in december 2005 mmc agreed to sell its majority interest in sedgwick cms holdings “scms” the sale of scms was completed on january 31 2006 and the associated gain on the sale was recognized in the first quarter of 2006 crump and scms are classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 

in may 2005 mmc sold the assets of mmc capital which had been mmc’s private equity management subsidiary to stone point capital llc “stone point” an entity controlled by the former managers of mmc capital for approximately 3 million at the time of the asset sale stone point assumed responsibility for management of the trident funds and other private equity funds previously managed by mmc capital mmc does not participate in the investment decisions or management of stone point or the private equity funds managed by stone point mmc through its subsidiary risk capital holdings continues to own investments in firms such as ace ltd xl capital ltd and axis capital holdings ltd as well as its investments in the trident ii and other funds managed by stone point 

subsequent event 

on january 31 2007 mmc entered into a stock purchase agreement with greatwest lifeco inc “gwl” a majorityowned subsidiary of power financial corporation pursuant to which gwl will purchase putnam investments trust the sale includes putnam’s interest in the th lee private equity business the aftertax cash proceeds to mmc are expected to be approximately 25 billion subject to possible adjustment based on i changes in putnam’s adjusted stockholders’ equity between september 30 2006 and closing and ii any decline below an agreed threshold in putnam’s adjusted asset management revenue between december 31 2006 and closing for further information and a copy of the stock purchase agreement please see our form 8k filed on february 1 2007 mmc expects the sale of putnam to close in mid2007 putnam is classified as part of continuing operations in this annual report because the decision to sell putnam was not made until after december 31 2006 and putnam did not meet the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation in 2006 we expect to classify putnam as a discontinued operation in the first quarter of 2007 

risk and insurance services 

in the risk and insurance services segment mmc’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers agents or consultants for insureds insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management insurance broking and insurance program management services primarily under the name of marsh and engage in reinsurance broking catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions primarily under the name of guy carpenter 

marsh and guy carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients andor commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided the particular insurer or reinsurer the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients revenues are affected by premium rate levels in the insurancereinsurance markets since compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insuredsreinsureds in many cases compensation may be negotiated in advance on the basis of the estimated value of the services to be performed revenue is also affected by fluctuations in the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by increases or decreases in the value of the risks that have been insured new and lost business and the volume of business from new and existing clients   

effective october 1 2004 marsh eliminated contingent compensation or market services agreements with insurers under which it had received revenues based upon such factors as the overall volume growth and in some cases profitability of the total business placed by marsh with a given insurer 

for billing and other administrative services marsh and guy carpenter receive interest income on certain funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others the investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities these regulations typically provide for segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates both of which vary from time to time 

following the sale of mmc capital’s business in may 2005 we no longer receive fees in connection with the private equity investments previously managed by mmc capital nor do we receive management fees or origination fees related to this business except that mmc retained the right to receive certain performance fees relating to the trident ii private equity partnership we continue to receive dividends and to recognize capital appreciation or depreciation on the investments held by risk capital holdings as well as revenue on risk capital holdings’ sales of investments from time to time 

the results of operations for the risk and insurance services segment are presented below 

 revenue 

revenue in risk and insurance services decreased 2 in 2006 compared with 2005 and was flat on an underlying basis higher revenue in reinsurance services and risk capital holdings was offset by a decrease in insurance services 

underlying revenue at marsh in 2006 was down 2 as compared to 2005 in 2006 marsh’s new business grew 10 percent globally with solid growth in all major geographies however new business growth was more than offset by decreased market service revenues which declined to 43 million in 2006 from 114 million in the prior year and the impact of a softer pricing environment in the property and casualty insurance markets 

effective january 1 2007 marsh will manage certain businesses formerly part of risk consulting  technology which had revenue of approximately 25 million in 2006 

reinsurance services revenue increased 5 primarily due to new business growth although us property catastrophe reinsurance premium rates were higher reinsurance premium rates for most other lines were stable to down and the market environment for property catastrophe reinsurance continued to be impacted by limited reinsurer capacity and higher risk retention by clients 

risk capital holdings revenue in 2006 was 2 higher compared with 2005 higher marktomarket gains primarily from mmc’s investments in the trident private equity funds were partly offset by lower realized gains from sales of directly held investments and the the elimination of investment management fees following the sale of mmc capital’s business in may 2005 revenue in 2006 increased 7 on an underlying basis due to higher investment gains we expect revenues related to risk capital holdings to decline in 2007 

in december 2006 mmc through its subsidiary risk capital holdings contributed its limited partnership interest in trident iii valued at 182 million to the uk pension fund the transaction was recorded at the estimated fair value of mmc’s investment on the date of the contribution risk capital holdings’ revenue in 2006 included 38 million of marktomarket gains for trident iii recognized through the date of the contribution 

at december 31 2006 the balance of accounts receivable related to accrued market services revenue earned prior to october 1 2004 was approximately 43 million compared with 132 million at december 31 2005 mmc intends to collect the remaining msa revenue earned prior to october 1 2004 and is seeking to enforce its rights under the contracts to collect amounts due however there is no assurance that mmc will be successful in collecting all amounts due to the extent such accrued amounts are not collected a charge to earnings would result in 2007 mmc collected an additional 23 million of accrued market service revenue 

revenue in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 10 in 2005 compared with 2004 reflecting decreases in both insurance services and reinsurance services revenue in insurance services underlying revenue decreased 13 excluding the impact of decreased market services revenue underlying revenue decreased 6 reflecting lower new business volume and lower commercial premium rates the decrease in underlying revenue was most significant in the united states however the percentage decline improved in the fourth quarter compared with earlier quarters in 2005 despite continued premium rate declines in the commercial insurance marketplace market services revenue declined from 521 million in 2004 to 114 million in 2005 

expense 

in 2006 expenses in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 9 compared to the prior year the decrease reflects cost savings from restructuring a decrease in restructuring charges from 257 million in 2005 to 100 million in 2006 a decrease of 45 million in settlement legal and regulatory costs related to market services agreements and associated shareholder and policyholder litigation and a decrease of 78 million related to employee retention awards in addition 2006 expenses reflect lower incentive compensation costs and lower costs related to professional liability claims partly offsetting these decreases were costs of 47 million in 2006 related to employee stock options the operating margin for 2006 improved to 124 from 55 in 2005 

expenses in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 14 in 2005 compared with the prior year expenses in 2004 included a 850 million charge related to the settlement with the nyag and nysid 

risk consulting  technology 

mmc’s risk consulting  technology segment primarily consists of kroll and its subsidiaries acquired by mmc in july 2004 kroll services fall into two major product lines consulting services which includes risk consulting corporate advisory  restructuring and security and technology enabled solutions 

kroll receives compensation primarily in the form of fees paid by clients these fees are typically earned on an hourly project fixed fee or perunit basis kroll’s revenue is subject to changes in international economic and regulatory conditions some of kroll’s revenue sources are countercyclical to the performance of the economy in general these sources may include for example fees from restructuring turnaround and forensic engagements relating to commercial bankruptcies and bond defaults kroll is also subject to normal competitive forces such as pricing pressures demand for professional staff and new product development on the part of competitors particularly in technology services 

the results of operations for the risk consulting  technology segment are presented below 

 revenue 

risk consulting  technology revenues increased 12 in 2006 compared with 2005 9 on an underlying basis the technology services group kroll’s largest business unit increased revenues by 12 this unit’s kroll ontrack electronic discovery business responded successfully to market conditions and continued its improvement from the first quarter of 2006 the consulting services group reported doubledigit growth primarily due to strong operations performance by corporate advisory and restructuring partially due to success fees on several large engagements background screening was driven by strong growth in the identity theft business 

in the fourth quarter of 2006 kroll completed the sale of ksi its international security operation that provides highrisk asset and personal protection services the financial results of ksi are included in discontinued operations effective january 1 2007 kroll will transfer to marsh certain businesses which had revenue of 25 million in 2006 

the yeartoyear comparisons of the segment’s revenue between 2005 and 2004 are significantly impacted by the fact that we acquired kroll in july 2004 as a result 2004 results include only six months of kroll’s operations underlying revenue growth in 2005 was 22 due to growth in the technology services corporate advisory and restructuring and background screening practices 

expense 

risk consulting  technology expenses increased 11 in 2006 compared with 2005 approximately half of the increase results from acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency fluctuation the remaining increase reflects higher compensation in the corporate advisory and restructuring and the background screening businesses as well as increased costs for outside services in the background screening business due to a higher volume of business expenses in 2006 include amortization of identified intangibles of 57 million in addition expenses in 2006 include a credit related to the early termination of a licensing agreement 

the yeartoyear comparisons of the segment’s expenses between 2005 and 2004 are significantly impacted by the fact that we acquired kroll in july 2004 as a result 2004 results include only six months of kroll’s operations expenses include amortization of identified intangible assets of 58 million and 24 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively 

consulting 

mmc conducts business in its consulting segment through mercer inc and its subsidiaries and affiliates mercer operates through two main business groups mercer human resource consulting “mercer hr” includes practice groups specializing in retirement and investments outsourcing health and benefits and talent the mercer specialty consulting businesses focus on management consulting organizational design and change management and economic consulting 

the major component of mercer’s revenue in both mercer hr and the mercer specialty consulting companies is fees paid by clients for advice and services mercer hr principally through its health  benefits line of business also earns significant revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group and occasionally individual insurance contracts 

primarily life health and accident coverages revenue for mercer global investment’s discretionary investment management business and certain of mercer hr’s outsourcing business defined contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under administration 

revenue in the consulting business is affected by among other things global economic conditions including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets revenue is also subject to competition due to the introduction of new products and services broad trends in employee demographics the effect of government policies and regulations and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates revenues from the provision of discretionary investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by securities market performance 

the results of operations for the consulting segment are presented below 

 revenue 

consulting revenue in 2006 increased 11 compared with 2005 revenue in mercer hr increased 8 or 7 on an underlying basis driven by strong growth in retirement and investments and talent mercer specialty consulting revenues grew 19 16 on an underlying basis each of the mercer specialty companies contributed to this performance led by mercer oliver wyman which increased underlying revenues 22 

consulting revenue in 2005 increased 4 compared with 2004 on an underlying basis revenue increased 3 due to a 18 increase in mercer specialty consulting while mercer hr decreased 1 versus prior year the increase in underlying revenue in mercer specialty reflected increases of 24 in management consulting reflecting a 25 increase in mercer oliver wyman and 6 in economic consulting within mercer hr underlying revenue decreased 1 reflecting a decline in the revenue associated with defined contribution plan assets previously administered by putnam and transferred to mercer effective january 1 2005 increased pricing competition on traditional actuarial valuation services and a decline in the employee benefits business transferred from marsh to mercer these declines were partly offset by strong growth in talent 

expense 

consulting expenses increased 12 in 2006 compared with 2005 the expense increase reflects restructuring charges of 27 million the impact of acquisitions and higher compensation costs due in part to increased staff levels in addition expenses in 2006 include costs of 41 million related to employee stock options 

consulting expenses increased 4 in 2005 compared with 2004 on an underlying basis expenses increased 3 as savings from restructuring activity and lower costs for restructuring were offset by employee retention costs increased benefits costs and higher expenses in specialty consulting due to a higher volume of business 

investment management 

mmc conducts business in its investment management segment through putnam putnam provides investment management and related services through a broad range of investment products including the putnam funds its own family of mutual funds which are offered to individual and institutional investors in support of the primary investment management business putnam subsidiaries provide other related services including transfer agency underwriting distribution shareholder services custodial trustee and other fiduciary services putnam fiduciary trust company “pftc” serves as transfer agent dividend disbursing agent registrar and custodian for the putnam funds and provides custody services to several external clients 

on january 31 2007 mmc entered into a stock purchase agreement with greatwest lifeco inc “gwl” a majorityowned subsidiary of power financial corporation pursuant to which gwl will purchase putnam investments trust mmc expects the sale of putnam to close in mid2007 putnam is classified as part of continuing operations in this annual report because the decision to sell putnam was not made until after december 31 2006 and putnam did not meet the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation in 2006 we expect to classify putnam as a discontinued operation in the first quarter of 2007 

putnam’s revenue is derived primarily from investment management and 12b1 fees described more fully below received from the putnam funds and investment management fees for institutional accounts putnam also receives fees from the putnam funds for administrative services performed by pftc 

putnam companies receive fees for the investment management services provided to the putnam funds and institutional accounts pursuant to investment advisory contracts under which the mutual fund or institutional investor pays fees to the putnam company that manages the fund or account the amount of the fees varies depending on the individual mutual fund or institutional account fees are usually based on a sliding scale in relation to assets under management and in some cases are also based on investment performance these advisory contracts generally may be terminated by either party without penalty and contracts with the putnam funds must be approved annually by the fund’s shareholders or trustees including a majority who are not affiliated with putnam putnam management and the fund trustees regularly review the putnam fund contract fee structures in light of fund performance the level and range of services provided and current industry conditions 

investment management revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of putnam’s assets under management assets under management are particularly affected by fluctuations in domestic and international stock and bond market prices and the net level of investments and withdrawals by current and new mutual fund shareholders and institutional clients items affecting revenue also include but are not limited to actual and relative investment performance service to clients the development and marketing of new investment products the relative attractiveness of putnam’s investment styles under prevailing market conditions changes in the investment patterns of fund shareholders and institutional clients and putnam’s ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels 

all openend putnam funds other than money market funds have adopted distribution plans pursuant to rule 12b1 under the investment company act of 1940 commonly referred to as 12b1 plans pursuant to these 12b1 plans the putnam funds make payments to putnam retail management “prm” to cover costs relating to distribution of the putnam funds and services provided to shareholders at rates that differ by class of fund shares these payments known as rule 12b1 fees enable prm to pay service fees and other continuing compensation to firms that distribute shares of the putnam funds and provide services to fund shareholders prm retains some rule 12b1 fees as compensation for the costs of distribution and other services provided by putnam and its affiliates to shareholders and for commissions advanced by putnam at the point of sale and recovered through fees received over time 

to firms that distribute shares of the putnam funds these 12b1 plans and rule 12b1 fees paid by the putnam funds thereunder are subject to annual renewal by the fund trustees and to termination by vote of the fund shareholders or by vote of a majority of the trustees who are not affiliated with putnam 

pftc receives compensation from the putnam funds for its administrative transfer agency and shareholder services and custodial services pursuant to respectively investor servicing agreements which may be terminated by either party on 90 days’ notice and pursuant to written custody agreements which may be terminated by either party on 30 days’ notice these contracts generally provide for compensation on the basis of several factors which vary with the type of service being provided the transfer agent servicing fee received by pftc is a fixed rate per account for retail shareholders and a fixed rate service fee based on assets under management for mutual fund defined contribution shareholders 

the results of operations for the investment management segment are presented below 

 revenue 

putnam’s revenue declined 8 in 2006 compared to 2005 due to a decrease in management fees resulting from a decline in average assets under management lower 12b1 fee revenue and lower transfer agency fees partly offset by higher investment income assets under management averaged 186 billion in 2006 a 5 decline from the 196 billion managed in the same period of 2005 assets under management aggregated 192 billion at december 31 2006 the increase in assets under management since december 31 2005 results from a 19 billion positive impact of market and investment performance partly offset by net outflows of 16 billion net flows for the fourth quarter of 2006 were neutral as of february 23 2007 yeartodate net outflows were approximately 5 billion 

at december 31 2006 assets held in equity securities represented 66 of assets under management compared with 68 in 2005 and 69 in 2004 while investments in fixed income products represented 34 compared with 32 in 2005 and 31 in 2004 

putnam’s revenue decreased 12 in 2005 reflecting a decrease in fees due to a decline in assets under management lower 12b1 fee revenue and decreased investment gains assets under management averaged 196 billion in 2005 a 10 decline from the 217 billion managed in 2004 assets under management aggregated 189 billion at december 31 2005 compared with 213 billion at december 31 2004 the change in assets under management from december 31 2004 results primarily from net redemptions of 31 billion partly offset by the positive impact of market performance 

putnam receives service fees from the putnam mutual funds for transfer agent custody and other administrative services as contracted by the trustees of the putnam mutual funds effective january 2005 the transfer agent service fee agreement was converted to a fixed rate per retail shareholder account and a fixed rate service fee based on average assets under management for mutual fund assets in defined contribution plans for the first six months of 2004 the transfer agent service fee agreement was based on the reimbursement of the cost of service for the third and fourth quarters 

of 2004 transfer agent service fees were based on a fixed fee and recorded as revenue the change in the service fee agreement resulted in an increase in both service fee revenue and expense of approximately 32 million in 2005 compared with 2004 

yearend and average assets under management are presented below 

 the categories of mutual fund assets reflect style designations aligned with each fund’s prospectus 

expense 

expenses in 2006 decreased 161 million from 2005 due to a decrease in amortization expense for prepaid dealer commissions and the yearoveryear effect of a 37 million charge in 2005 relating to costs to address issues associated with the calculation of certain amounts previously paid to putnam by putnam mutual funds in the form of cost reimbursements to putnam for transfer agency services relating to defined contribution operations partly offsetting these decreases were costs of 14 million related to employee stock options 

expenses for 2005 decreased 23 from 2004 expenses in 2005 include a 37 million charge described above expenses in 2004 include a charge of 224 million related to putnam’s regulatory settlements with the sec and the secretary of the commonwealth of massachusetts on markettiming issues other expense reductions in 2005 include lower compensation and severance costs reduced costs related to regulatory issues a decrease in amortization expense for prepaid dealer commissions and a decrease in restructuring charges these reductions were partially offset by an increase in expenses previously borne by the funds under the prior transfer agent service agreement putnam’s expenses in 2004 include a 25 million credit to compensation expense associated with the settlement with putnam’s former chief executive officer 

 corporate expenses 

corporate expenses of 137 million in 2006 were 150 million lower than in 2005 the decrease is primarily due to the impact of stock option expense which was recorded as a corporate charge in 2005 and was charged to the business segments in 2006 and lower net restructuring charges largely resulting from a gain on the disposal of five floors in mmc’s headquarters building partly offset by higher professional services fees 

in 2006 mmc corporate recorded a net credit of 31 million for restructuring and related charges a 74 million gain on the sale of five floors in mmc’s headquarters building was partly offset by future rent on noncancelable leases for floors vacated by mmc as well as accelerated amortizationdepreciation related to floors that have been or will be vacated as part of the restructuring the sale of these floors is an integral part of mmc’s overall restructuring plan and the gain from this disposal has been included as a reduction of other operating expense consistent with the classification of other actions taken related to facilities mmc has vacated in 2005 mmc corporate recorded 72 million of restructuring and related charges primarily related to the consolidation of office space in london 

corporate expenses were 287 million in 2005 compared to 39 million in 2004 expenses in 2005 included 64 million of incremental expenses primarily related to stock options resulting from the adoption of sfas 123 r effective july 1 2005 the incremental cost related to the implementation of sfas 123 r was charged to corporate and not to the operating segments in 2005 in addition 6 million was recorded for severance and other termination benefits related to the 2005 plan and a charge of 49 million was recorded related to the consolidation of office space in london because the office consolidation was initiated by mmc to benefit its london operations as a whole the related charge was recorded in corporate corporate expenses also reflected 30 million of charges in connection with the resolution of certain litigation and related matters 

corporate expenses in 2004 included 18 million of restructuring costs including severance and other termination benefits future rent under noncancelable leases and lease termination costs the impact of the final settlement for insured losses related to the wtc reduced corporate expenses in 2004 the replacement value of the assets exceeded their book value by 105 million which was recorded as a reduction of other operating expenses

interest income earned on corporate funds amounted to 64 million in 2006 an increase of 17 million from 2005 the increase in interest income reflected the combination of higher average corporate cash balances and generally higher average interest rates in 2006 compared with the prior year interest expense of 303 million in 2006 decreased from 332 million in 2005 the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to 34 million recorded in the third quarter of 2005 for the prepayment charge incurred in connection with the refinancing of the mortgage on mmc’s headquarters building in new york 

interest income was 47 million for 2005 an increase of 26 million from 2004 the increase in interest income reflected the combination of higher average corporate cash balances and generally higher average interest rates in 2005 compared with 2004 interest expense was 332 million in 2005 compared to 219 million in 2004 the increase in interest expense is due to an increase in the amount of average outstanding debt resulting from the acquisition of kroll and a 34 million charge in 2005 for the prepayment of the 200 million mortgage on mmc’s corporate headquarters in new york in addition interest expense in 2005 includes a writeoff of 7 million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to mmc’s prior revolving credit agreements which were refinanced in december 2005 

income taxes 

mmc’s consolidated effective tax rate was 318 in 2006 compared to 337 in 2005 the change primarily reflects the release of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets and the resolution of tax audit issues partly offset by an adjustment of the 2005 tax provision estimates to the tax return amount 

mmc’s consolidated effective tax rate was 337 in 2005 a decrease from 594 in 2004 the decrease in the rate was primarily due to the impact in 2004 of the nondeductibility of putnam’s 224 million in regulatory settlements and of a lower benefit related to marsh’s 850 million settlement of the nyag lawsuit partially offset in 2005 by an increase in valuation allowances provided on net operating losses in certain state and foreign jurisdictions 

the effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of mmc’s earnings which may have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the rate furthermore losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations and may require valuation allowances affecting the rate depending on estimates of their realizability 

mmc establishes allowances for potential liabilities that may arise out of tax audits and litigation to the extent that such liabilities are probable and can be estimated in accordance with sfas no 5 once established allowances are evaluated based on the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue for which an allowance had previously been recorded such adjustments could have a material impact on mmc’s effective tax rate net income and cash flows in a particular future period 

2005 stock option exchanges 

at the may 2005 annual meeting mmc’s shareholders approved a stock option exchange offer for mmc options under the exchange offer eligible employees could exchange certain deeply underwater options for new options with an estimated fair value equal to 90 of the value of options surrendered in exchange calculated using the blackscholes pricing model effective july 1 2005 employees elected to exchange 42 million options for 16 million new options the exchange resulted in the retirement of 26 million options and no incremental compensation expense was incurred in connection with the new option grants the exercise price of the new options of 2786 is equal to the market price of mmc’s common stock as of the new grant date the new options were unvested when granted and will vest on the later of the second anniversary of the new option grant or the vesting date of the tendered option the other terms and conditions of the new options are substantially similar to those of the tendered options they replaced 

on september 29 2005 certain eligible participants in the putnam investments trust equity partnership plan participated in a voluntary option exchange pursuant to the terms of the offer to exchange certain outstanding options the “offer to exchange” dated august 30 2005 under the offer to exchange holders of options on class b shares meeting certain eligibility requirements could elect to exchange those options for restricted shares with the equivalent value of the exchanged options as determined using the blackscholes valuation model as a result of the offer to exchange a total of 2201850 options were retired and 139388 restricted shares were issued at a grant price of 2826 per share 

liquidity and capital resources 

mmc’s routine liquidity needs are primarily for servicing debt and paying dividends on outstanding stock our primary source for meeting these requirements is cash flows from our operations 

cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheet as an offset to fiduciary liabilities 

operating cash flows 

mmc generated 878 million of cash from operations in 2006 compared with 399 million in 2005 these amounts reflect the net income earned by mmc during those periods excluding gains or losses from the disposition of businesses the gain on the sale of five floors from the mmc headquarters building and adjusted for noncash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets these include payments in 2006 of approximately 270 million for regulatory settlements and tax payments of 136 million related to the disposition of businesses cash generated from the disposition of businesses is included in investing cash flows 

in january 2005 mmc reached a settlement with the nyag and nysid that resolved the actions commenced by them against mmc and marsh as a result of this agreement mmc recorded a charge in 2004 for an 850 million policyholder fund mmc paid the first 255 million to the fund on june 1 2005 an additional 255 million was paid on june 1 2006 and 170 million will be paid to the fund on or before each of june 1 2007 and 2008 respectively these amounts are included in regulatory settlements in the consolidated balance sheets 

mmc has funding requirements for the us nonqualified and nonus pension plans in 2007 of approximately 19 million and 176 million respectively mmc’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable foreign law there currently is no erisa funding requirement for the us qualified plan in 2006 or in 2007 funding requirements for nonus plans vary country by country contribution rates are determined by the local actuaries based on local funding practices and requirements funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in addition amounts funded in the future to the extent not due under regulatory requirements may be affected by alternative uses of mmc’s cash flows including dividends investments and share repurchases 

during 2006 mmc contributed approximately 20 million to the us pension plans and 319 million to the significant nonus pension plans compared with 229 million for us plans and 498 million for significant nonus plans in 2005 the contribution to the nonus plans in 2006 includes a noncash contribution of mmc’s investment in trident iii a private equity limited partnership the contribution was recorded based on the estimated fair value on the date of the contribution of 182 million 

financing cash flows 

net cash used for financing activities was 759 million in 2006 compared with 128 million of net cash provided by financing activities in 2005 during 2006 mmc reduced outstanding debt by approximately 570 million 

in december 2005 mmc and certain of its foreign subsidiaries entered into a new 12 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility subsidiary borrowings under the facility are unconditionally guaranteed by mmc the facility which will expire in december 2010 replaced mmc’s 10 billion and 700 million revolving credit facilities which were scheduled to expire in 2007 and 2009 respectively in december 2005 certain of mmc’s foreign subsidiaries borrowed approximately 510 million under the new facility primarily to fund the repatriation of accumulated earnings pursuant to the american jobs creation act of 2004 there was 94 million outstanding under this facility at december 31 2006 

in september 2005 mmc issued 550 million of 515 senior notes due 2010 and 750 million of 575 senior notes due 2015 the “2005 notes” the net proceeds from the 2005 notes were used to pay down the 13 billion term loan facility established in late 2004 

also in september 2005 mmc refinanced its headquarters building in new york city by entering into a 30year 475 million mortgage loan agreement at a fixed annual rate of 57 this replaced the existing 200 million 98 mortgage due in 2009 the incremental proceeds net of a 34 million prepayment charge were used to pay down outstanding shortterm debt 

mmc’s senior debt is currently rated baa2 by moody’s and bbb by standard  poor’s mmc’s shortterm debt is currently rated p2 by moody’s and a2 by standard  poor’s mmc carries a negative outlook from both moody’s and standard  poor’s 

mmc paid total dividends of 374 million in 2006 068 per share and 363 million 068 per share in 2005 mmc made no share repurchases in 2006 

in january 2007 mmc announced that its board of directors had approved an increase to mmc’s quarterly cash dividend to 19 cents per share from 17 cents previously 

mmc also maintains other credit facilities guarantees and letters of credit with various banks primarily related to operations located outside the united states aggregating 270 million at december 31 2006 and 354 million at december 31 2005 there was 8 million outstanding under these facilities at december 31 2006 

investing cash flows 

net cash used for investing activities amounted to 136 million in 2006 compared with 153 million of net cash provided by investing activities in 2005 cash generated by the sale of scms totaled 326 million in 2006 which was partly offset by net purchases of long term investments cash used for acquisitions totaled 221 million in 2006 versus 74 million in 2005 remaining deferred cash payments of approximately 75 million related to acquisitions completed in 2006 and prior years are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2006 proceeds from sales related to fixed assets and capitalized software includes 125 million of proceeds related to the sale of the floors from the mmc headquarters building in addition cash used to purchase investments of 193 million was partly offset by the sale of securities of 118 million in 2006 in 2005 cash generated by the sale of securities totaled 333 million 

mmc expects the after tax proceeds from the anticipated sale of putnam in mid2007 to approach 25 billion subject to certain adjustments in the sale agreement mmc will analyze various alternatives for use of the expected proceeds including acquisitions adjustments to our capital structure such as debt repayment andor share repurchases and investments in our existing businesses 

mmc’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software which amounted to 307 million in 2006 and 345 million in 2005 primarily relate to computer equipment purchases the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs 

mmc has committed to potential future investments of approximately 222 million in connection with various private equity funds and other mmc investments the commitment comprises 82 million related to trident ii and other funds managed by stone point and 140 million related to possible investments by putnam at december 31 2006 mmc has no future commitments related to trident iii as those commitments were assumed by mmc’s uk pension plan when the investment in trident iii was contributed to the plan in december 2006 the majority of mmc’s other investment commitments for funds managed by stone point are related to trident ii the investment period for which is now closed for new investments any remaining capital calls for trident ii would relate to followon investments in existing portfolio companies or for management fees or other partnership expenses significant future capital calls related to trident ii are not expected although it is anticipated that trident ii will be harvesting its remaining portfolio in 2007 and thereafter the timing of any portfolio company sales and capital distributions is unknown and not controlled by mmc 

putnam has investment commitments of 140 million for three active thomas h lee “thl” funds of which putnam believes approximately 42 million will not be called putnam is authorized to commit to invest up to 187 million in future thl investment funds but is not required to do so at december 31 2006 none of that additional 187 million is committed these commitments will remain with putnam when the anticipated sale of putnam closes 

approximately 37 million was invested in 2006 related to all of the commitments discussed above including investments in trident iii prior to its contribution to mmc’s uk pension plan 

commitments and obligations 

mmc’s contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december 31 2006 dollars in millions 

 market risk 

certain of mmc’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets 

interest rate risk mmc manages its net exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing a mixture of variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance mmc’s asset base mmc uses interest rate swaps on a limited basis to manage exposure to interest rate movements on its cash and investments as well as interest expense on borrowings rate swaps are only executed with highly creditworthy counterparties 

mmc had the following investments and debt instruments subject to variable interest rates 

 these investments and debt instruments are discussed more fully in the aboveindicated notes to the consolidated financial statements 

based on the above balances if shortterm interest rates increase by 10 or 48 basis points over the course of the year annual interest income including interest earned on fiduciary funds would increase by approximately 15 million however this would be partially offset by a 2 million increase in interest expense resulting in a net increase to income before income taxes and minority interest of 13 million 

foreign currency risk the translated values of revenue and expense from mmc’s international risk and insurance services and consulting operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates we periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business 

equity price risk mmc holds investments in public and private companies as well as in certain private equity funds managed by stone point publicly traded investments of 124 million are classified as available for sale under sfas no 115 nonpublicly traded investments of 75 million are accounted for using the cost method and 366 million are accounted for using the equity method under apb opinion no 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” changes in value of trading securities are recognized in income when they occur the investments that are classified as available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of changes in market value which if determined to be other than temporary could result in realized impairment losses mmc periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements 

other a significant number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

management’s discussion of critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding mmc’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from those estimates 

legal and other loss contingencies mmc and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims lawsuits and proceedings gaap requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant management judgment is required to comply with this guidance mmc analyzes its litigation exposure based on available information including consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of these matters to assess its potential liability 

in addition to the extent that insurance coverage is available significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are expected under mmc’s various insurance programs 

retirement benefits mmc maintains qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for its us and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for eligible nonus employees mmc’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable foreign laws 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans – an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” “sfas 158” sfas 158 requires that mmc 

recognize the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans the “plans” as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” net of tax in mmc’s balance sheet mmc adopted the provisions of sfas 158 prospectively on december 31 2006 

the determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and assumed rate of salary increase significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements mmc believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate actuarial assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate based on its current assumptions mmc expects pension expense to decrease by approximately 53 million in 2007 and currently expects to contribute approximately 195 million to the plans during 2007 

during 2005 mmc made changes to the us pension plan that were designed to reduce mmc’s benefits costs going forward the changes which were effective january 1 2006 include changing the benefit formula from a final average salary to a career average salary as well as a change in the calculation for early retirement benefits during 2006 mmc made similar changes to its uk pension plans 

future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions future investment performance future assumptions and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans holding all other assumptions constant a halfpercentage point change in the rate of return and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the us and uk plans which comprise approximately 84 of total pension plan liabilities as follows 

 changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense because the longterm rates of inflation and salary increases are correlated with the discount rate 

mmc contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees the cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the united states is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire but is funded by mmc as incurred this postretirement liability is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets the key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes mmc’s tax rate reflects its income statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating tax positions tax allowances are established when despite the belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable there is the potential that they may be successfully challenged these allowances as well as the related interest are adjusted to reflect changing facts and circumstances   

tax law requires items be included in mmc’s tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that future taxable income will be insufficient to use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements 

as discussed below under new accounting pronouncements mmc’s accounting for income taxes will be impacted by the adoption of fasb interpretation no 48 

sharebased payment effective july 1 2005 mmc adopted sfas 123r “sharebased payment” which requires among other things that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values in addition management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards as defined by sfas 123r 

as of december 31 2006 there was 84 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to mmc’s option awards and 15 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to putnam’s option awards the weightedaverage periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized are 14 years for mmc and 17 years for putnam also as of december 31 2006 there was 203 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to mmc’s restricted stock restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards and 94 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to putnam’s restricted stock awards 

see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of sfas 123r 

investment valuation mmc holds investments in both public and private companies as well as certain private equity funds managed by stone point and th lee the majority of the public investments are accounted for as available for sale securities under sfas no 115 where applicable certain investments are accounted for under apb opinion no 18 mmc periodically reviews the carrying value of its investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements mmc bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they relate to each investment fair value of private equity investments is determined by the funds’ investment managers factors considered in determining the fair value of private equity investments include implied valuation of recently completed financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors performance multiples of comparable public companies restrictions on the sale or disposal of the investments trading characteristics of the securities and the relative size of the holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public market float in those instances where quoted market prices are not available particularly for equity holdings in private companies or formal restrictions limit the sale of securities significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate value of mmc’s investments mmc reviews the appropriateness of valuation results for significant private equity investments with the fund manager 

new accounting pronouncements 

new accounting pronouncements are discussed in note 1 to mmc’s consolidated financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas 158 which requires that mmc recognize the funded status of its overfunded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans the “plans” as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic costs are recorded as a component of aoci net of tax in mmc’s balance sheet mmc adopted the provisions of sfas 158 prospectively on december 31 2006 the impact of adopting sfas 158 caused a reduction in assets of 660 million and an increase in liabilities of 245 million including a related adjustment to tax benefits of 423 million the net impact of adopting sfas 158 was a reduction of mmc’s stockholders’ equity of 905 million 804 million including an adjustment for the impact of recording a minimum pension credit prior to the adoption of sfas 158 this adoption has no impact on mmc’s consolidated statements of income or cash flows the adoption of sfas 158 does not impact any financial covenants in mmc’s bank agreements nor does mmc expect adoption to adversely impact its credit ratings sfas 158 also requires companies to measure the funded status of their plans as of their yearend balance sheet date no later than 2008 mmc’s existing policy is to measure the funded status of its plans as of its yearend balance sheet date and therefore is not impacted by this requirement 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosures about fair value measurements the provisions of sfas 157 are effective as of the beginning of mmc’s 2008 fiscal year mmc is currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas 157 on its consolidated financial statements 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions this interpretation requires that mmc recognize in its consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the provisions of fin 48 will be effective for mmc beginning in the first quarter of 2007 with the cumulative effect of any change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings on february 27 2007 the fasb issued draft implementation guidance in the form of a proposed fasb staff position subject to a thirty day comment period pending finalization of this guidance mmc is evaluating the impact of adopting fin 48 on its consolidated financial statements

risk and insurance services  mmc’s combined insurance and reinsurance broking services business is the world’s largest of its kind the principal bases upon which our insurance and reinsurance businesses compete include the range quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients mmc encounters strong competition in the risk and insurance services business from other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis from a large number of regional and local firms in the united states the european union and elsewhere from insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses including 

commercial and investment banks accounting firms and consultants that provide riskrelated services and products 

certain insureds and groups of insureds have established programs of self insurance including captive insurance companies as a supplement or alternative to thirdparty insurance thereby reducing in some cases their need for insurance placements there are also many other providers of affinity group and private client services including specialized firms insurance companies and other institutions 

in 2005 marsh and guy carpenter’s competitive positions were adversely affected and may continue to be adversely affected in the future by the impact of legal and regulatory proceedings brought by regulators and law enforcement authorities and related publicity concerning their insurance and reinsurance brokerage operations these proceedings and the settlement thereof are discussed in more detail in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this report please also read our discussion of the risks associated with these proceedings and their impact under item 1a “risk factors” below 

risk consulting and technology  in risk consulting and technology we face competition from local regional national and international firms that provide similar services in the fields of accounting corporate advisory and restructuring services investigative and security services consulting and technology services kroll’s consulting services group faces competition from local regional national and international accounting firms and forensic accounting litigation support investigative and other specialist and consulting firms kroll’s corporate advisory  restructuring group faces competition from national and international accounting firms and specialist recovery firms kroll’s security group faces competition from international and local security firms government security contractors and architectural engineering firms kroll’s technology services group faces competition from small independent service providers and technology companies 

consulting  mmc’s consulting and hr outsourcing businesses face strong competition from other privately and publicly held worldwide and national companies as well as regional and local firms these businesses compete generally on the basis of the range quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients competitors include independent consulting and outsourcing firms as well as consulting and outsourcing operations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms the employee benefit plan administrative and trustee business of pftc that was recently combined with mercer’s hr outsourcing business was adversely affected in 2004 and 2005 by the markettiming related issues and other events that gave rise to the administrative proceedings brought by the sec and the massachusetts secretary of the commonwealth in the fourth quarter of 2003 these events may continue to adversely affect the combined hr outsourcing businesses in the future see our discussion of the risks associated with these proceedings and their impact under item 1a “risk factors” below 

mercer’s investment service business faces competition from many sources including multimanager services offered by other investment consulting firms and financial institutions mercer’s recently established multimanager business in particular faces significant competition from betterestablished rivals with greater experience in that market for many of the services provided by mercer clients also have the option of handling these issues internally without assistance from outside advisors 

investment management  putnam’s investment management business is highly competitive putnam competes with other providers of investment products and services primarily on the basis of the range of investment products offered investment performance distribution scope and quality of shareholder and other services and general reputation in the marketplace sales of putnam fund 

shares are also influenced by general securities market conditions government regulations global economic conditions and advertising and sales promotional efforts putnam competes with other mutual fund firms and institutional asset managers that offer investment products similar to putnam’s as well as products which putnam does not offer including passively managed funds such as index funds putnam also experiences competition from a number of mutual fund sponsors that offer their funds to the general public without sales charges which putnam does not do 

in addition to competition from firms already in the investment management business including public and private firms commercial banks stock brokerage and investment banking firms and insurance companies putnam experiences competition from other firms offering financial services and other investment alternatives although putnam has expanded its marketing and distribution outside the united states it competes in nonus markets with local and global firms many of which have much larger investment management businesses than putnam in their respective nonus markets putnam’s competitive position continued to be adversely affected in 2005 and may continue to be adversely affected in the future by the underperformance in prior years of certain putnam funds relative to competing products in the mutual fund marketplace 

many securities dealers whose large retail distribution systems play an important role in the sale of shares in the putnam funds also sponsor competing proprietary mutual funds to the extent that such securities dealers value the ability to offer customers a broad selection of investment alternatives they will continue to sell independent funds such as putnam’s notwithstanding the availability of proprietary products however to the extent that these firms limit or restrict the sale of putnam fund shares through their brokerage systems in favor of their proprietary mutual funds putnam’s assets under management and thus putnam’s revenues might decline 

in 2004 and 2005 putnam’s competitive position was adversely affected and may continue to be adversely affected in the future by the markettiming related issues and other events that gave rise to the administrative proceedings brought by the sec and the massachusetts state authorities in the fourth quarter of 2003 these proceedings and the settlement thereof are discussed in more detail in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this report please also read our discussion of the risks associated with these proceedings and their impact below under item 1a “risk factors”

 item 1a 

  risk factors tableend in addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the sec the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating mmc and its businesses the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing mmc and its subsidiaries additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or otherwise may also impair our business operations if any of the risks described below or such other risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

legal and regulatory proceedings by federal and state regulators and law enforcement authorities concerning mmc and certain of its subsidiaries particularly our insurance and reinsurance brokerage operations as well as class actions derivative actions and individual suits brought by policyholders and shareholders may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in october 2004 the office of the new york state attorney general the “nyag” filed a civil complaint in new york state court against mmc and marsh inc asserting claims under new york law for fraudulent business practices antitrust violations securities fraud unjust enrichment and common law fraud relating to marsh’s broker compensation arrangements including in particular marsh’s compensation under market services agreements also in october 2004 the new york state insurance department the “nysid” issued a citation ordering mmc and a number of its subsidiaries and affiliates that hold new york insurance licenses to appear at a hearing and show cause why regulatory action should not be taken against them this citation which also related to marsh’s broker compensation arrangements charged the respondents with the use of fraudulent coercive and dishonest practices violations of the new york general business law relating to contracts or agreements for monopoly or in restraint of trade and violations of the new york insurance law that resulted from unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices on january 30 2005 mmc and marsh entered into an agreement with the nyag and the nysid to settle the nyag lawsuit and the nysid citation the “settlement agreement” pursuant to the settlement agreement we agreed to establish a fund of 850 million payable over four years for eligible policyholder clients in 2004 we recorded a charge for the full amount of this fund and on june 1 2005 we made our first payment into the fund in the amount of 255 million our next payment also in the amount of 255 million is due on june 1 2006 approximately 70000 eligible policyholders across the united states have elected to receive a distribution from the fund and will receive approximately 750 million of the 850 million made available thereunder 

the settlement agreement does not resolve any investigation proceeding or action commenced by the nyag or the nysid against any of our former or current employees since the filing of the nyag lawsuit ten former marsh employees have pleaded guilty to criminal charges relating to the matters under investigation on september 15 2005 eight former marsh employees including one individual who has since pleaded guilty were indicted on various counts relating to these same matters the nyag has indicated that its investigation of the insurance industry is continuing 

notwithstanding the settlement agreement numerous other lawsuits have been commenced against us one or more of our subsidiaries and our current and former directors and officers relating to matters alleged in the nyag lawsuit numerous putative class action suits purportedly brought on behalf of policyholders and our shareholders against us certain of our subsidiaries and certain of our current and former officers and directors are pending in various federal and state courts and in canada shareholder derivative suits have been filed in various jurisdictions there are also several actions brought by individual policyholders and additional suits may be filed by other policyholders the myriad claims asserted in these suits include alleged violations of federal 

securities and antitrust laws erisa rico and other statutory and common law claims and seek significant damages in addition the state of connecticut has commenced a lawsuit against marsh challenging marsh’s conduct in connection with the placement of a loss portfolio transfer of workers’ compensation claims for the state of connecticut’s department of administrative services following the announcement of the nyag lawsuit and the related actions taken by mmc mmc’s stock price dropped from approximately 45 per share to a low of approximately 2275 per share 

in addition following the filing of the nyag lawsuit mmc and certain of its subsidiaries received notices of investigations and inquiries together with requests for documents and information from attorneys general departments of insurance and other governmental entities in a significant number of jurisdictions other than new york that relate to the allegations in the nyag lawsuit offices of attorneys general in 22 jurisdictions have issued one or more requests for information or subpoenas calling for the production of documents or for witnesses to provide testimony subpoenas letters of inquiry and other information requests have been received from departments of insurance or other state agencies in 38 jurisdictions given the number of pending investigations there is a significant possibility that mmc or its subsidiaries could face administrative proceedings or other regulatory actions fines or penalties including without limitation actions to revoke or suspend insurance broking licenses mmc also has been contacted by certain state attorneys general and commissioners of insurance indicating that they may seek additional monetary or other remedies from mmc 

an adverse outcome under any of the lawsuits and regulatory actions involving mmc and its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the lawsuits and regulatory actions could result in negative publicity reputational damage and harm to our client and employee relationships any of these developments could negatively affect revenues in our insurance and reinsurance brokerage and other businesses 

for further information about the above and other legal and regulatory matters involving mmc and its subsidiaries see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this report 

we may not be successful in implementing our new business model and restructuring plans 

since 2004 mmc has made significant changes to its business model including the elimination of contingent compensation or market services agreements with insurers the elimination of market services revenue has negatively affected our financial results we recognized market services revenue of 124 million in 2005 relating to insurance placements made before october 1 2004 this was a decrease of 417 million from 2004 and we expect that market services revenue in 2006 will be lower than in 2005 mmc’s new business model includes an initiative whereby marsh seeks to increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that are disclosed to its clients while we expect that this incremental revenue will affect mmc’s results in 2006 marsh’s revenue initiative is subject to competitive challenges and has been progressing more slowly than anticipated as a result we cannot be sure of the timing or amount of the incremental revenue to be achieved 

in light of our new business environment we have examined our cost structure to identify areas where expenses can be reduced as a result of this examination in the fourth quarter of 2004 we initiated a restructuring plan including among other features the reduction of headcount and the consolidation of facilities in 2005 we began further restructuring initiatives in response to our business environment as discussed more fully below under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we expect our 2004 and 2005 restructuring initiatives to result in annual cost savings of 775 million we cannot assure you 

however that we will achieve this level of cost savings in which case our restructuring efforts would not affect our profitability as positively as we expect 

we may not be able to collect our remaining accounts receivable for market services revenue earned before october 1 2004 

effective october 1 2004 marsh agreed to eliminate contingent compensation agreements with insurers as of december 31 2005 we had 130 million of accounts receivable recorded in our financial statements related to market services revenue earned prior to october 1 2004 while we intend to collect this outstanding market services revenue we cannot assure you that we will be successful in collecting all amounts due to the extent the accrued amounts are not collected a charge to our earnings would result 

we may experience loss of key personnel and clients 

across all of our businesses we must preserve our capabilities to serve clients and the capacity to support staff development retention of our employees therefore is critical to us and the loss of key managerial personnel or significant revenue producers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations since late 2004 we have developed compensation programs to retain motivate and reward certain key employees but we cannot be certain of our ability to retain our key employees or attract similar new employees in the future 

in addition as a result of the recent legal and regulatory matters referred to above we may lose important clients or experience difficulty in generating new business in our insurance brokerage or other businesses in this event our revenues and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

regulatory investigations and lawsuits arising from markettiming and other issues at putnam may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in 2003 and 2004 putnam entered into settlements with the sec and the commonwealth of massachusetts the “massachusetts securities division” with respect to excessive shortterm trading by certain former putnam employees in shares of the putnam funds also in late 2003 and continuing through spring 2005 putnam received document subpoenas andor requests for information from various other federal and state enforcement authorities inquiring into among other things the matters that were the subject of the proceedings by the sec and the massachusetts securities division 

various offices of the sec the massachusetts securities division and the department of labor are investigating putnam with respect to among other things plan expense reimbursements with certain multiemployer deferred compensation plans that are putnam clients putnam research fund’s investment management fee the erisa aspects of certain investments by the putnam profit sharing retirement plan and certain other erisa issues and issues relating to the notices accompanying certain closedend distributions 

during the course of the sec’s investigation of certain matters that arose in the defined contribution plan administration business formerly conducted by pftc issues arose relating to the calculation of certain cost reimbursements paid in previous years by the putnam funds to putnam for transfer agent services relating to defined contribution operations these issues are being reviewed by putnam and the trustees of the putnam funds and pending the completion of this review putnam has recorded charges totaling 37 million for the estimated cost that it believes will be necessary to address these issues putnam has briefed the sec the federal deposit insurance corporation and other governmental authorities on this matter 

in addition mmc and putnam have received complaints in over 70 civil actions based on allegations of “markettiming” and in some cases “late trading” activities these actions were filed in courts in various states with all actions filed in federal court now having been transferred to the united states district court for the district of maryland certain putnam entities have also been sued in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts for alleged violations of the investment company act of 1940 in connection with the receipt of purportedly excessive advisory and distribution fees paid by the mutual funds in which plaintiffs purportedly owned shares putnam is also a defendant in a lawsuit by a former institutional client alleging that putnam breached its investment management agreement and did not make appropriate disclosures to the client at the time the investment management agreement was executed and putnam also is awaiting the conclusion of an arbitration process involving similar issues with another former institutional client 

an adverse outcome under or reputational damage caused by any of the legal and regulatory matters involving putnam could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

for further information about the above and other legal and regulatory matters involving mmc and its subsidiaries see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements appearing under item 8 of this report 

putnam may not be able to maintain its investment management and administrative fee revenues at current levels 

putnam’s revenue is derived primarily from investment management and 12b1 fees received from the putnam funds and investment management fees received from institutional clients investment management revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under management among the particular factors affecting assets under management are the levels of investments and withdrawals by current and new mutual fund shareholders and institutional clients in 2005 assets under putnam’s management were adversely affected and may continue to be adversely affected in the future by redemptions in response to the underperformance in prior years of certain putnam funds relative to competing products in the mutual fund marketplace as well as by the “markettiming” and “shortterm” trading issues referred to above continued declines in putnam’s assets under management would negatively affect results of operations in our investment management segment 

the advisory contracts pursuant to which putnam receives fees for investment management services provided to the putnam funds continue in effect only so long as approved at least annually by the funds’ shareholders or trustees including a majority who are not affiliated with putnam putnam’s management and the fund trustees regularly review the fund fee structure in light of fund performance the level and range of services provided industry conditions and other relevant factors effective january 1 2006 pursuant to discussions held with the trustees during the annual management contract review putnam reduced the management fees it receives with respect to nine of its 12 closedend mutual funds further reductions in management fees payable under these contracts andor the termination of one or more of these contracts could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in our investment management segment 

also as discussed under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” most of the openend putnam funds have adopted 12b1 plans pursuant to which the mutual funds make payments to prm to cover costs for various distribution and related services each of these 12b1 plans and payments made by the respective putnam mutual funds thereunder is subject to annual renewal by the fund’s trustees and to termination by vote of the fund’s shareholders or by vote of a majority of the fund trustees who are not affiliated with 

putnam actions by the trustees to reduce the level of 12b1 fees paid by a fund or to make other changes that would reduce the amount of 12b1 fees received by putnam or the failure of the trustees to approve continuation of the 12b1 plans for class b deferred sales charge shares would have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in our investment management segment 

we are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from “errors and omissions” claims 

mmc’s operating companies provide numerous services for clients around the world for example marsh advises on and places insurance coverage and sometimes provides related services such as risk management advice and claims management and collections guy carpenter performs similar services in its role as a reinsurance broker mercer renders a variety of consulting and investment management services as a result of these and other activities mmc operating companies are potentially subject to errors and omissions or eo claims by clients and third parties who may allege that they were damaged as a result of mmc’s failure to perform its duties as expected mmc works hard to minimize its potential eo exposures by among other things prevention and remediation efforts and employee educationtraining but it is not possible to prevent eo exposures completely when eo claims do arise claimants often seek monetary damages in the case of marsh and guy carpenter claimants may allege losses representing the value of insurance or reinsurance coverage lost due to broker negligence in the case of mercer claimants may allege losses due to negligent investment or consulting advice 

eo claims in any given case can be significant and may subject mmc in addition to potential liability for monetary damages to reputational harm and diversion of personnel and management resources since 2001 the worldwide market for professional liability insurance for eo claims in the financial services industry has contracted significantly which has caused mmc to assume increasing levels of selfinsurance for its potential eo exposures mmc uses internal actuarial and other estimates and caselevel reviews by inside and outside counsel to establish loss reserves which it believes are adequate to provide for this selfinsured retention these reserves are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant nevertheless given the unpredictability of eo claims and of litigation which could flow from them it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on mmc’s results of operations or financial condition in a given quarterly or annual period for further information about our eo exposure and related insurance coverage including selfinsurance see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements appearing under item 8 of this report 

declines in premium rate levels in the insurance and reinsurance markets could adversely affect our risk and insurance services segment revenues 

we derive most of our revenues in the risk and insurance services segment which comprised 47 of our 2005 operating segments revenue from fees paid by clients and commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies this compensation is frequently based on premiums paid by insureds which we do not determine and which vary widely based on market conditions which may differ by market cycles by location and by type of coverage factors that may cause market premium levels to decline include expanded underwriting capacity of insurance carriers increased competition among insurance carriers and consolidation in the insurance markets declines in premium levels generally or in any particular insurance market would adversely affect revenues derived from our insurance and reinsurance broking activities 

we operate in a highly competitive environment 

we generally face strong competition across all of our business segments from providers of similar products and services in particular we have encountered competitive pressures in our risk 

and insurance services segment as a result of the recent legal and regulatory matters referred to above in our investment management segment putnam’s competitive position has been adversely affected and may continue to be adversely affected in the future by the underperformance in prior years of certain putnam funds relative to competing products in the mutual fund marketplace mercer’s consulting and administration businesses face increasing competitive pressures due in part to an increasing focus by regulators clients and others on potential conflicts of interest 

our cost of financing has been negatively affected by our recent legal and regulatory issues and credit rating downgrades since october 2004 

we may need to raise additional financing in the future in order to fund maturing debt obligations and possibly to fund acquisitions or other growth in our business largely as a result of the legal and regulatory matters referred to above our cost of financing has been and may continue to be negatively affected 

following the filing of the nyag lawsuit in october 2004 uncertainty regarding changes in our business model the impact of eliminating contingent compensation agreements and potential fines andor penalties resulted in credit rating downgrades by moody’s and standard  poor’s further credit rating downgrades could negatively affect our access to and cost of financing sources 

we are exposed to various risks associated with the global nature of our operations 

we have significant worldwide operations which subjects us to associated legal economic operational and market risks these risks include among others 

      some of our brokerage subsidiaries in foreign countries receive revenue that differs from their functional currencies also we generally must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars although we periodically use derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse effects due to exchange rate fluctuations we cannot eliminate these risks and significant changes in exchange rates may have an adverse effect on our financial results 

actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business

mmc operates in four principal business segments based on the services provided risk and insurance services includes risk management and insurance and reinsurance broking and services provided primarily by marsh and guy carpenter risk consulting and technology conducted through kroll includes risk consulting and related investigative intelligence financial security and technology services consulting which comprises the activities of mercer human resource consulting and mercer’s specialty consulting businesses includes human resource consulting and related services and specialized management and economic consulting services we conduct investment management through putnam a fuller description of our segments’ business activities is included in part i item 1 of this report

this mda contains forwardlooking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 see “information concerning forwardlooking statements” at the outset of this report 

significant developments in 2005 

2005 was a year of transition for mmc mmc’s historical financial information should be viewed in light of the significant developments discussed below 

new business model in risk and insurance services 

since 2004 mmc has made significant changes to its business model our new business model has three main aspects a commitment to make all fees and other remuneration earned by mmc for the placement of insurance coverage fully transparent to our clients in the us and in major markets around the world the elimination of contingent compensation or market services agreements with insurers and an initiative to offset to the extent possible lost market services revenue by increasing brokerage commissions and fees 

during 2005 mmc made significant progress implementing the requirements of the settlement agreement with the office of the new york state attorney general “nyag” and the new york state insurance department “nysid” we developed and rolledout compliance infrastructure and governance processes developed and rolledout transparency standards and related policies and procedures trained employees in core and certain specialty business lines and established compliance monitoring groups to measure compliance while marsh is the mmc subsidiary most directly affected by these settlementrelated activities guy carpenter and mercer’s health and benefits practices are also affected 

mmc’s revenue in 2005 was impacted by a 417 million decrease in market services revenue in 2005 market services revenue of 124 million related to insurance placements made prior to october 1 2004 was recognized in the financial statements it is expected that market services revenue recognized in 2006 will be significantly lower than in 2005 

as discussed above our new business model includes an initiative whereby marsh seeks to increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that are disclosed to its clients management expects that this incremental revenue will affect mmc’s results in 2006 given the relatively recent launch of marsh’s compensation initiative and the competitive challenges we currently face in the insurance brokerage market it is difficult to predict the specific timing and amount of this revenue impact 

in addition to the impact on revenue of the elimination of market services agreements “msa” revenues in the risk and insurance services segment were affected by declining commercial insurance premium rates during most of 2005 premium rate decreases began to abate in the fourth quarter of 2005 due to the initial effects of the major storms that hit the united states a more significant impact on reinsurance premium rates as a result of the storms is expected in the first quarter of 2006 

at december 31 2005 the balance of accounts receivable related to accrued market services revenue earned prior to october 1 2004 was approximately 130 million mmc intends to collect outstanding msa revenue earned prior to october 1 2004 and is enforcing its contractual rights to collect amounts due in december 2005 mmc initiated arbitration proceedings against certain insurance carriers for this purpose however there is no assurance that mmc will collect all amounts due to the extent mmc does not collect accrued amounts a charge to earnings would result 

as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in connection with the january 2005 settlement agreement with the nyag and nysid mmc established an 850 million policyholder fund policyholders representing 88 of the value of the fund or approximately 750 million opted to participate and have signed a release related to all matters alleged in the nyag lawsuit and nysid amended citation except for claims which are based on arise out of or relate to the purchase or sale of mmc securities 

also as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements on september 21 2005 working with the national association of insurance commissioners the “naic” mmc reached a multistate regulatory settlement the naic settlement agreement adopts the business reforms and the 850 million fund for policyholder clients provided by mmc’s previous settlement with the nyag and nysid the naic agreement has been executed by mmc and marsh and as of february 17 2006 has been adopted by insurance commissioners in 33 states and the district of columbia and guam 

restructuring 

in response to mmc’s changed business environment we initiated restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2004 and first quarter of 2005 the restructuring plans are described in more detail in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

during 2005 net restructuring expenses were 317 million primarily related to the 2005 restructuring plan these charges comprise severance and other termination benefits of 196 million related to the elimination of approximately 2600 employee positions future rent under noncancelable leases of 116 million and other costs of 41 million partially offset by a 36 million gain from the sale of certain small commercial accounts and other dispositions in addition in 2005 mmc incurred incremental expense related to the accelerated amortization of leasehold improvements of 12 million additional charges of approximately 50 million are expected to be incurred in 2006 largely in the first half of the year as the remaining actions contemplated under the 2005 restructuring plan are completed 

annual savings of 375 million are expected when the 2005 plan is fully implemented results in 2005 reflect approximately 160 million of savings realized from the 2005 plan with the remaining savings of approximately 215 million expected in 2006 all of the savings from the 2005 restructuring plan relate to the risk and insurance services segment results in 2005 also reflect savings of approximately 400 million resulting from the 2004 restructuring plan 

employee retention initiatives 

in late 2004 and in 2005 mmc initiated a number of actions designed to retain and motivate employees throughout our businesses retention awards were granted primarily in risk and insurance services and consulting resulting in additional costs of 115 million in 2005 in addition stock option exchange programs were offered to employees who held deeply underwater mmc or putnam options the option exchange programs are discussed in more detail later in this mda mmc also implemented new or expanded longterm incentive programs in several of its businesses 

businesses exited in 2005 

in october 2005 marsh completed the sale of crump group inc its usbased wholesale insurance broker the gain on the sale of 14 million net of tax was recognized in the fourth quarter in december 2005 mmc agreed to sell its majority interest in sedgwick cms holdings the sale was completed on january 31 2006 and we will recognize the associated gain on the sale in the first quarter of 2006 in the fourth quarter of 2005 mmc determined that the crump and scms businesses met the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations all previously reported financial information has been reclassified to conform with the current presentation see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these dispositions 

in may 2005 mmc sold the assets of mmc capital which had been mmc’s private equity management subsidiary to stone point capital llc “stone point” an entity controlled by the former managers of mmc capital for approximately 3 million at the time of the asset sale stone point assumed responsibility for management of the trident funds and other private equity funds previously managed by mmc capital mmc does not participate in the investment decisions or management of stone point or the private equity funds managed by stone point mmc through its subsidiary risk capital holdings continues to own investments in firms such as ace ltd xl capital ltd and axis capital holdings ltd as well as its investments in the trident funds and other funds managed by stone point which have a total recorded value at december 31 2005 of approximately 397 million mmc no longer receives management fees or origination fees related to stone point’s asset management business but may receive performance fees from trident funds ii and iii based on each fund’s aggregate rate of return mmc continues to receive dividends and to recognize capital 

appreciation or depreciation on the investments held by risk capital holdings and has approximately 190 million of remaining capital commitments to funds managed by stone point 

longterm financings 

in december 2005 mmc and certain of its foreign subsidiaries entered into a new fiveyear 12 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility subsidiary borrowings under the facility are unconditionally guaranteed by mmc the new facility which will expire in 2010 replaced mmc’s 10 billion and 700 million revolving credit facilities which were scheduled to expire in 2007 and 2009 respectively in december 2005 certain of mmc’s foreign subsidiaries borrowed approximately 510 million under the new facility primarily to fund the repatriation of accumulated earnings pursuant to the american jobs creation act of 2004 in connection with the termination of its previous revolving credit facilities mmc recorded as interest expense a 7 million writeoff of unamortized deferred financing costs 

in september 2005 mmc completed two financings to enhance liquidity mmc returned to the public capital markets issuing 550 million of 515 senior notes due 2010 and 750 million of 575 senior notes due 2015 the proceeds from these notes were used to pay down outstanding bank borrowings that were scheduled to mature in december 2006 

also in september 2005 mmc refinanced its headquarters building in new york by entering into a 30year 475 million mortgage loan agreement at a fixed annual rate of 57 this replaced the existing 200 million 98 mortgage due in 2009 the incremental proceeds net of a 34 million prepayment charge were used to pay down outstanding shortterm debt 

consolidated results of operations 

 consolidated operating income in 2005 increased 43 to 856 million reflecting significantly lower costs related to regulatory settlements at marsh and putnam and savings from restructuring initiatives partly offset by lower revenues in risk and insurance services and investment management employee retention costs and incremental costs from the implementation of sfas 123r risk and insurance services results in 2005 include the impact of a 402 million decrease in msa revenue the segment’s 2004 results were impacted by an 850 million charge relating to the settlement agreement reached with the nyag and nysid investment management results in 2005 reflect reduced costs for regulatory settlements and related charges partly offset by a decline in revenue resulting from lower assets under management results for consulting reflect a 4 increase in revenue and lower costs for restructuring and restructuringrelated charges results for risk consulting and technology in 2005 reflect a full year of operations for kroll which was acquired in july 2004 corporate results in 2005 include restructuring charges of 59 million incremental compensation expense of 64 million primarily related to stock options resulting from the adoption of sfas 123r as of july 1 2005 and 30 million of settlement and other costs in 2004 corporate expenses included a credit of 105 million for insurance recoveries related to world trade center losses 

consolidated revenues and expenses 

consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2005 of 117 billion was 1 lower than in 2004 reduced revenue in the risk and insurance services and investment management segments was offset by increases in the risk consulting  technology and consulting segments revenue 

decreased 6 on an underlying basis which measures the change in revenue before the impact of acquisitions and dispositions and using constant currency rates excluding the impact of the elimination of msas underlying revenue decreased 3 

the impact of foreign currency translation acquisitions and dispositions on mmc’s operating revenue by segments is as follows 

 

    34 

during 2005 revenue in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 10 from 2004 underlying revenue declined 11 resulting from a 402 million decline in market services revenue lower levels of new business and renewals and the impact of lower insurance premium rates these declines were partly offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates risk consulting  technology revenue increased 541 million due to the acquisition of kroll in july 2004 results in 2005 include for the first time a full year of revenue for kroll compared with six months of revenue in 2004 underlying growth in risk consulting  technology was 21 due to growth in kroll’s technology services corporate advisory and restructuring and background screening businesses consulting revenue increased 4 resulting from a 17 increase in mercer’s specialty consulting businesses investment management revenue declined 12 as a result of the decrease in assets under management and lower investment income 

consolidated operating expenses decreased 3 from 2004 to 2005 this was primarily due to savings from restructuring initiatives and lower regulatory and other settlement expenses partly offset by employee retention costs the impact of acquisitions higher benefits costs and incremental costs primarily related to stock options resulting from the implementation of sfas 123 r in addition putnam’s expenses in 2005 include a charge of 37 million for the estimated cost necessary to address issues relating to the calculation of certain amounts previously paid to putnam by the putnam mutual funds in the form of cost reimbursements to putnam for transfer agency services relating to defined contribution operations expenses in 2004 include an 850 million charge related to the nyagnysid settlement costs of 224 million related to putnam’s settlement and agreements with the sec and office of the secretary of the commonwealth of massachusetts and restructuring costs of 337 million partly offset by a 105 million credit from the final insurance settlement related to world trade center losses 

consolidated revenue in 2004 increased 5 from 2003 the increase in revenue was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange revenue decreased 3 on an underlying basis primarily driven by a decrease in investment management revenue due to a decline in average assets under management and a decrease in risk and insurance services revenue resulting from a decision to no longer accept msa revenue for placements made after september 30 2004 these revenue declines were partially offset by an increase in underlying revenues in consulting due to higher demand for strategic advice 

consolidated operating expenses increased 27 in 2004 over 2003 of which 10 was due to the effects of acquisitions and foreign exchange expenses in 2004 also include an 850 million charge related to the settlement agreement with the nyag and the nysid charges of 224 million related to putnam’s settlement agreements costs of 337 million related to restructuring mmc’s businesses severance of 108 million incurred prior to implementation of the restructuring plan in the fourth quarter and increased pension costs of 93 million these costs were partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense for prepaid dealer commissions a credit to compensation expense related to the settlement with putnam’s former chief executive officer and a credit of 105 million from the final settlement with insurers for claims related to the september 11 2001 attacks on the world trade center 

risk and insurance services 

in the risk and insurance services segment mmc’s subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers agents or consultants for insureds insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management insurance broking and insurance program management services primarily under the name of marsh and engage in reinsurance broking catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions primarily under the name of guy carpenter 

marsh and guy carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients and commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided the particular insurer or reinsurer the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients revenues are affected by premium rate levels in the insurance markets since compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds in many cases compensation may be negotiated in advance on the basis of the estimated value of the services to be performed revenue is also affected by fluctuations in the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by increases or decreases in the value of the risks that have been insured new and lost business and the volume of business from new and existing clients 

effective october 1 2004 marsh eliminated contingent compensation or market services agreements with insurers under which it had earned revenues based upon such factors as the overall volume growth and in some cases profitability of the total business placed by marsh with a given insurer the circumstances under which we terminated our market services agreements and the related revenue impact in our risk and insurance services segment are discussed above under “significant developments in 2005 — new business model in risk and insurance services” 

for billing and other administrative services marsh and guy carpenter receive interest income on certain funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others the investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities these regulations typically provide for segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates both of which vary from time to time 

following the sale of mmc capital’s business in may 2005 discussed above under “significant developments in 2005 — businesses exited in 2005” we no longer receive fees in connection with the private equity investments previously managed by mmc capital nor do we receive management fees or origination fees related to this business we continue to receive dividends and to recognize capital appreciation or depreciation on the investments held by risk capital holdings as well as revenue on risk capital holding’s sales of investments from time to time 

the results of operations for the risk and insurance services segment are presented below 

 revenue 

revenue in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 10 in 2005 compared with 2004 reflecting decreases in both insurance services and reinsurance services revenue 

in insurance services underlying revenue decreased 13 excluding the impact of decreased market services revenue underlying revenue decreased 6 reflecting lower new business volume and lower commercial premium rates the decrease in underlying revenue was most significant in the united states however the percentage decline improved in the fourth quarter compared with earlier quarters in 2005 despite continued premium rate declines in the commercial insurance marketplace 

market services revenue declined from 521 million in 2004 to 119 million in 2005 effective october 1 2004 marsh agreed to eliminate contingent compensation agreements with insurers the 

market services revenue recognized in 2005 relates to placements made prior to october 1 2004 marsh did not accrue a portion of market services revenue earned on those placements because it could not complete its normal process to determine that collection of these amounts was reasonably assured for certain contracts any such revenue earned prior to but not accrued at september 30 2004 is recognized when collected or when confirmation of the amount of payment is received from the carriers this resulted in the recognition of market services revenue of 119 million in 2005 it is expected that market services revenue in 2006 will be significantly lower than in 2005 

reinsurance premium rates in the us property catastrophe and certain specialty lines appear to be increasing due to the effects of the recent hurricanes on insurance marketplace conditions and have affected revenue in the first quarter of 2006 however revenue from sales of investments by risk capital holdings is expected to decline in 2006 and it remains difficult to estimate the amount and timing of the incremental revenue to be generated by marsh’s commission and fee initiative described above 

revenue for the risk and insurance services segment grew 1 in 2004 over 2003 underlying revenue declined 3 in insurance services underlying revenue decreased 6 primarily due to a reduction in msa revenue from 820 million in 2003 to 521 million in 2004 this excludes the market services revenue of 20 million in 2004 and 25 million in 2003 related to the employee benefits business transferred to consulting effective april 1 2005 client revenue increased approximately 1 reflecting 3 growth in europe and 4 growth in other international markets partially offset by a 2 decline in north america underlying revenue in reinsurance broking remained unchanged 

expense 

expenses in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 14 in 2005 compared with the prior year expenses in 2004 included a 850 million charge related to the settlement with the nyag and nysid 

expenses in 2005 include restructuring costs of 255 million related to the restructuring activities we initiated in 2005 the “2005 plan” discussed below as well as 78 million of costs related to employee retention programs 88 million related to incremental regulatory and compliance costs and higher benefit costs due to higher pension expense expenses in 2005 also include costs of approximately 2 million related to restructuring activities that began in the fourth quarter of 2004 the expense increases described above more than offset expense savings resulting from the restructuring activities undertaken in 2004 and 2005 

in 2005 charges of 255 million related to the 2005 plan were incurred primarily for severance and benefits related to staff reductions affecting approximately 2600 employees and for future rent under noncancelable leases annualized savings of approximately 375 million are expected in the risk and insurance services segment when the 2005 plan is fully implemented in the first half of 2006 of this amount 160 million was realized in 2005 and the remaining 215 million of expected savings should be realized in 2006 additional restructuring charges related to the 2005 plan of 50 million are expected to be incurred in 2006 largely in the first half of the year 

in 2004 risk and insurance services expenses increased 35 over 2003 approximately 20 of the increase was due to an 850 million charge for the settlement agreement with the nyag and the nysid and legal and other costs of 31 million related to this matter expenses in 2004 included restructuring charges of 231 million including severance and other termination benefits future rent under noncancelable leases and lease termination costs and incremental amortization of 7 million related to accelerated amortization or abandonment of leasehold improvements expenses in 2004 

also included 8 million for employee retention programs in connection with accounting guidance issued by the institute of chartered accountants in the uk mmc reassessed its obligation to provide future claims handling and certain administrative services for brokerage clients in the european marketplace mmc determined that under certain circumstances it is obligated to provide such services based on its current business practices and recorded a pretax charge of approximately 65 million to reflect the change in estimated cost to provide these services the effects of acquisitions and foreign exchange increased expenses by 6 on an underlying basis and excluding the items previously discussed expenses increased 4 

risk consulting and technology 

mmc’s risk consulting and technology segment consists of kroll and its subsidiaries acquired by mmc in july 2004 the segment also includes portions of the risk consulting business previously managed by marsh under the risk and insurance services segment the services previously managed by marsh include forensic accounting insurance claims accounting and preparation and crisis consulting kroll delivers its services through four business groups consulting services corporate advisory  restructuring security and technology services 

kroll receives compensation for its risk consulting and technology services in the form of fees paid by clients these fees are typically earned on an hourly project fixed fee or per unit basis kroll’s revenue is subject to changes in international economic and regulatory conditions some of kroll’s revenue sources are countercyclical to the performance of the economy in general these sources may include for example fees from restructuring turnaround and forensic engagements relating to commercial bankruptcies and bond defaults kroll is also subject to normal competitive forces such as pricing pressures demand for professional staff and new product development on the part of competitors particularly in technology services 

the results of operations for the risk consulting and technology segment are presented below 

 results of operations 

the yeartoyear comparisons of the segment’s revenue expense and operating income are significantly impacted by the fact that we acquired kroll in july 2004 as a result 2004 results include only six months of kroll’s operations underlying revenue growth in 2005 was 21 due to growth in the technology services corporate advisory and restructuring and background screening practices expenses include amortization of identified intangible assets of 58 million and 24 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively 

consulting 

mmc conducts business in its consulting segment through mercer inc and its subsidiaries and affiliates mercer operates through two main business groups mercer human resource consulting includes practice groups specializing in retirement and investment consulting human resource services and investments health and benefits and human capital the mercer specialty consulting businesses focus on management consulting organizational design and change management and economic consulting 

the major component of mercer’s revenue in both mercer human resource consulting and the mercer specialty consulting businesses is fees paid by clients for advice and services mercer human resource consulting principally through its health  benefits line of business also earns significant revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group and occasionally individual insurance contracts primarily life health and accident coverages revenue for mercer global investment’s discretionary investment management business and certain of mercer hr services and investment’s defined contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under administration 

revenue in the consulting business is affected by among other things global economic conditions including changes in clients’ particular industries and markets revenue is also subject to competition due to the introduction of new products and services broad trends in employee demographics the effect of government policies and regulations and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates revenues from the provision of discretionary investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by securities market performance 

the results of operations for the consulting segment are presented below 

 revenue 

consulting revenue in 2005 increased 4 compared with 2004 on an underlying basis revenue increased 3 due to a 16 increase in mercer’s specialty consulting businesses partly offset by a 1 decline in human resources consulting the increase in underlying revenue in specialty consulting reflects increases of 24 in management consulting reflecting a 25 increase in mercer oliver wyman and 6 in economic consulting within the human resources consulting businesses underlying revenue decreased 1 reflecting a decline in the revenue associated with defined contribution plan assets previously administered by putnam and transferred to mercer effective january 1 2005 increased pricing competition on traditional actuarial valuation services and a decline in the employee benefits business transferred from marsh to mercer these declines were partly offset by strong growth in human capital consulting 

consulting revenue in 2004 increased 11 over 2003 acquisitions which accounted for 4 of the revenue growth in 2004 include synhrgy hr technologies which closed in january 2004 and oliver wyman  company “owc” which closed on april 1 2003 on an underlying basis revenue increased 3 in mercer hr consulting underlying revenue was flat in mercer’s specialty consulting businesses underlying revenue increased 13 

expense 

consulting expenses increased 4 in 2005 compared with 2004 on an underlying basis expenses increased 3 as savings from restructuring activity and lower costs for restructuring were offset by employee retention costs increased benefits costs and higher expenses in specialty consulting due to a higher volume of business 

consulting expenses increased 14 in 2004 compared with 2003 expenses in 2004 included restructuring charges of 62 million including severance and other termination benefits and future 

rent under noncancelable leases and lease termination costs as well as incremental expense of 7 million related to accelerated amortization or abandonment of leasehold improvements and other assets expenses in 2004 also included 4 million for employee retention programs in addition the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange increased expense by 9 on an underlying basis and excluding the items discussed above expenses increased 2 primarily due to higher employee compensation and benefit costs 

investment management 

mmc conducts business in its investment management segment through putnam putnam provides investment management and related services through a broad range of investment products including the putnam funds its own family of mutual funds which are offered to individual and institutional investors in support of the primary investment management business putnam subsidiaries provide other related services including transfer agency underwriting distribution shareholder services custodial trustee and other fiduciary services pftc serves as transfer agent dividend disbursing agent registrar and custodian for the putnam funds and provides custody services to several external clients

putnam companies receive fees for the investment management services provided to the putnam funds and institutional accounts pursuant to investment advisory contracts under which the mutual fund or institutional investor pays fees to the putnam company that manages the fund or account the amount of the fees varies depending on the individual mutual fund or institutional account fees are usually based on a sliding scale in relation to assets under management and in some cases are also based on investment performance these advisory contracts generally may be terminated by either party without penalty and contracts with the putnam funds must be approved annually by the fund’s shareholders or trustees including a majority who are not affiliated with putnam putnam management and the fund trustees regularly review the putnam fund contract fee structures in light of fund performance the level and range of services provided and current industry conditions 

investment management revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of putnam’s assets under management assets under management are particularly affected by fluctuations in domestic and international stock and bond market prices and the net level of investments and withdrawals by current and new mutual fund shareholders and institutional clients items affecting revenue also include but are not limited to actual and relative investment performance service to clients the development and marketing of new investment products the relative attractiveness of putnam’s investment styles under prevailing market conditions changes in the investment patterns of fund shareholders and institutional clients and putnam’s ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels 

all openend putnam funds other than money market funds have adopted distribution plans pursuant to rule 12b1 under the investment company act of 1940 commonly referred to as 12b1 plans pursuant to these 12b1 plans the putnam funds make payments to prm to cover costs relating to distribution of the putnam funds and services provided to shareholders at rates that differ by class of fund shares these payments known as rule 12b1 fees enable prm to pay service fees and other continuing compensation to firms that distribute shares of the putnam funds and provide services to fund shareholders prm retains some rule 12b1 fees as compensation for the costs of distribution and other services provided by putnam and its affiliates to shareholders and for commissions advanced by putnam at the point of sale and recovered through fees received over 

time to firms that distribute shares of the putnam funds these 12b1 plans and rule 12b1 fees paid by the putnam funds thereunder are subject to annual renewal by the fund trustees and to termination by vote of the fund shareholders or by vote of a majority of the trustees who are not affiliated with putnam 

pftc receives compensation from the putnam funds for its administrative transfer agency and shareholder services and custodial services pursuant to respectively investor servicing agreements which may be terminated by either party on 90 days’ notice and pursuant to written custody agreements which may be terminated by either party on 30 days’ notice these contracts generally provide for compensation on the basis of several factors which vary with the type of service being provided the transfer agent servicing fee received by pftc is a fixed rate per account for retail shareholders and a fixed rate service fee based on assets under management for mutual fund defined contribution shareholders 

the results of operations for the investment management segment are presented below 

 revenue 

putnam’s revenue decreased 12 in 2005 reflecting a decrease in fees due to a decline in assets under management lower 12b1 fee revenue and decreased investment gains assets under management averaged 196 billion in 2005 a 10 decline from the 217 billion managed in 2004 assets under management aggregated 189 billion at december 31 2005 compared with 213 billion at december 31 2004 the change in assets under management from december 31 2004 results primarily from net redemptions of 31 billion partly offset by the positive impact of market performance we expect average assets under management to decline in 2006 

putnam receives service fees from the putnam mutual funds for transfer agent custody and other administrative services as contracted by the trustees of the putnam mutual funds effective january 2005 the transfer agent service fee agreement was converted to a fixed rate per retail shareholder account and a fixed rate service fee based on average assets under management for mutual fund assets in defined contribution plans for the first six months of 2004 the transfer agent service fee agreement was based on the reimbursement of the cost of service for the third and fourth quarters of 2004 transfer agent service fees were based on a fixed fee and recorded as revenue the change in the service fee agreement resulted in an increase in both service fee revenue and expense of approximately 32 million in 2005 compared with 2004 the change in the service fee contract is expected to have an immaterial impact on operating income in future quarters 

at the end of 2005 assets held in equity securities represented 68 of assets under management  compared with 69 in 2004 and 72 in 2003 while investments in fixed income products represented 32 compared with 31 in 2004 and 28 in 2003 

putnam’s revenue decreased 13 in 2004 reflecting a decrease in fees due to a decline in average assets under management partially offset by higher investment gains higher equity income resulting from thl transaction fees related to private equity investments and increased transfer agent fees assets under management averaged 217 billion for the year ended december 31 2004 a 16 decline from the 258 billion managed in 2003 assets under management aggregated 213 billion at 

december 31 2004 compared with 240 billion at december 31 2003 the change from december 31 2003 primarily resulted from net redemptions of 51 billion partly offset by increases due to market appreciation of 16 billion and the consolidation of panagora’s 8 billion of assets under management as of july 2004 

the change in the service fee calculation mentioned above resulted in an increase in both service fee revenue and expenses of approximately 41 million during the second half of 2004 

yearend and average assets under management are presented below 

 the categories of mutual fund assets reflect style designations aligned with each fund’s prospectus 

expense 

expenses for 2005 decreased 23 from 2004 expenses in 2005 include a 37 million charge for the estimated costs necessary to address issues relating to the calculation of certain amounts previously paid to putnam by the putnam mutual funds in the form of cost reimbursements to putnam for transfer agency services relating to defined contribution operations expenses in 2004 include a charge of 224 million related to putnam’s regulatory settlements with the sec and the secretary of the commonwealth of massachusetts on markettiming issues other expense reductions in 2005 include lower compensation and severance costs reduced costs related to regulatory issues a decrease in amortization expense for prepaid dealer commissions and a decrease in restructuring charges these reductions were partially offset by an increase in expenses previously borne by the funds under the prior transfer agent service agreement putnam’s expenses in 2004 include a 25 million credit to compensation expense associated with the settlement with putnam’s former chief executive officer equity awards granted in september 2005 are expected to increase putnam’s expenses by approximately 26 million in 2006 

expenses in 2004 which increased 11 from 2003 included 224 million for putnam’s regulatory settlements with the sec and the commonwealth of massachusetts restructuring costs totaled 

26 million including 10 million related to a startup hedge fund management business at mmc that was subsequently discontinued other significant items recorded in 2004 were severance of 57 million incurred prior to the fourth quarter restructuring as well as incremental costs related to regulatory issues and repositioning putnam including legal and audit costs of 45 million and communications costs of 16 million in 2004 putnam discontinued the practice of directing brokerage commissions and virtually eliminated the use of soft dollars causing expenses to increase by approximately 40 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense for prepaid dealer commissions and a 25 million credit to compensation expense associated with the settlement with putnam’s former chief executive officer 

corporate items 

corporate expenses 

corporate expenses were 287 million in 2005 compared to 39 million in 2004 expenses in 2005 include 64 million of incremental expenses primarily related to stock options resulting from the adoption of sfas 123 r effective july 1 2005 the incremental cost related to the implementation of sfas 123 r is being charged to corporate and not to the operating segments in 2005 because this expense is excluded from the operating company results reviewed by mmc’s chief operating decision maker for performance measurement in addition 6 million was recorded for severance and other termination benefits related to the 2005 plan and a charge of 49 million was recorded in the first quarter related to the consolidation of office space in london because the office consolidation was initiated by mmc to benefit its london operations as a whole the related charge was recorded in corporate corporate expenses also reflect 30 million of charges in connection with the resolution of certain litigation and related matters which are discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

corporate expenses in 2004 included 18 million of restructuring costs including severance and other termination benefits future rent under noncancelable leases and lease termination costs the impact of the final settlement for insured losses related to the wtc reduced corporate expenses in 2004 the replacement value of the assets exceeded their book value by 105 million which was recorded as a reduction of other operating expenses 

integration and restructuring charges 

note 13 to the consolidated financial statements discusses integration and restructuring costs the following chart summarizes the costs incurred and the savings realized and projected for mmc’s restructuring activities 

 restructuring activities under the 2005 plan which we initiated in the first quarter of 2005 are nearing completion in 2005 mmc incurred expenses in connection with the 2005 plan of 310 million approximately twothirds of which was severance cost additional expenses of 50 million are expected to be incurred primarily in the first half of 2006 once the 2005 plan is fully implemented mmc expects to achieve annualized cost savings of 375 million all of which is in the risk and insurance services segment results in 2005 reflect approximately 160 million of the savings 

expected under the 2005 plan with the remaining 215 million of savings expected to be realized in 2006 savings under the 2004 plan were 400 million substantially all of which was realized in 2005 

restructuring costs in 2005 also include a 4 million increase to the estimated liability for future rent under noncancellable leases related to the johnson and higgins and sedgwick acquisitions 

stock option exchanges 

at the may 2005 annual meeting mmc’s shareholders approved a stock option exchange offer for mmc options under the exchange offer eligible employees could exchange certain deeply underwater options for new options with an estimated fair value equal to 90 of the value of options surrendered in exchange calculated using the blackscholes pricing model effective july 1 2005 employees elected to exchange 42 million options for 16 million new options the exchange resulted in the retirement of 26 million options and no incremental compensation expense was incurred in connection with the new option grants the exercise price of the new options of 2786 is equal to the market price of mmc’s common stock as of the new grant date the new options were unvested when granted and will vest on the later of the second anniversary of the new option grant or the vesting date of the tendered option the other terms and conditions of the new options are substantially similar to those of the tendered options they replaced 

on september 29 2005 certain eligible participants in the putnam investments trust equity partnership plan participated in a voluntary option exchange pursuant to the terms of the offer to exchange certain outstanding options the “offer to exchange” dated august 30 2005 under the offer to exchange holders of options on class b shares meeting certain eligibility requirements could elect to exchange those options for restricted shares with the equivalent value of the exchanged options as determined using the blackscholes valuation model as a result of the offer to exchange a total of 2201850 options were retired and 139388 restricted shares were issued at a grant price of 2826 per share 

interest 

interest income was 47 million for 2005 an increase of 26 million from 2004 the increase in interest income reflected the combination of higher average corporate cash balances and generally higher average interest rates in 2005 compared with 2004 interest expense was 332 million in 2005 compared to 219 million in 2004 the increase in interest expense is due to an increase in the amount of average outstanding debt resulting from the acquisition of kroll and a 34 million charge in 2005 for the prepayment of the 200 million mortgage on mmc’s corporate headquarters in new york in addition interest expense in 2005 includes a writeoff of 7 million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to mmc’s prior revolving credit agreements which were refinanced in december 2005 

interest income earned on corporate funds was 21 million in 2004 compared with 24 million in 2003 interest expense increased from 185 million in 2003 to 219 million in 2004 the increase in interest expense was due primarily to an increase in the amount of average outstanding debt primarily due to the acquisition of kroll 

income taxes 

mmc’s consolidated effective tax rate was 336 in 2005 a decrease from 594 in 2004 the decrease in the rate was primarily due to the impact in 2004 of the nondeductibility of putnam’s 224 million in regulatory settlements and of a lower benefit related to marsh’s 850 million settlement of the nyag lawsuit partially offset in 2005 by an increase in valuation allowances 

provided on net operating losses in certain state and foreign jurisdictions in 2003 the effective tax rate was 328 the increase in the effective rate in 2004 compared with 2003 results primarily from the tax impact of the aforementioned settlements and a partially offsetting benefit for foreign earnings taxed at lower rates 

the effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of mmc’s earnings which may have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the rate furthermore losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations and may require valuation allowances affecting the rate depending on estimates of their realizability 

mmc establishes allowances for potential liabilities that may arise out of tax audits and litigation to the extent that such liabilities are probable and can be estimated in accordance with sfas no 5 once established allowances are evaluated based on the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period adjustments may result for example upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue for which an allowance had previously been recorded such adjustments could have a material impact on mmc’s effective tax rate net income and cash flows for a particular future period 

liquidity and capital resources 

mmc’s routine liquidity needs are primarily for servicing debt and paying dividends on outstanding stock our primary source for meeting these requirements is cash flows from our operations 

cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheet as an offset to fiduciary liabilities 

operating cash flows 

mmc generated 399 million of cash from operations in 2005 compared with 21 billion in 2004 these amounts reflect the net income earned by mmc during those periods adjusted for noncash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets in addition to the routine timing of payments and receipts mmc had several significant events which impacted its cash flow over the past two years due to differences between when the items are recognized in net income and when they are paid these include payments in 2005 of approximately 308 million for regulatory settlements accrued in 2004 payment of restructuring costs and discretionary contributions of 235 million to the pension plans in the uk 

as previously discussed in january 2005 mmc reached a settlement with the nyag and nysid that resolved the actions commenced by them against mmc and marsh as a result of this agreement mmc recorded a charge in 2004 for an 850 million policyholder fund mmc paid the first 255 million to the fund on june 1 2005 an additional 255 million must be paid on or before june 1 2006 and 170 million will be paid to the fund on or before each of june 1 2007 and 2008 respectively these amounts are included in regulatory settlements in the consolidated balance sheets 

at december 31 2005 the balance of accounts receivable related to accrued market services revenue earned prior to october 1 2004 was 130 million following the announcement of the settlement with the nyag and nysid mmc reaffirmed its intention to collect outstanding msa revenue earned prior to october 1 2004 and will seek to enforce its rights under the relevant contracts in december 2005 mmc initiated arbitration proceedings against certain insurance carriers for this purpose however there is no assurance that mmc will be successful in collecting all amounts due to the extent such accrued amounts are not collected a charge to earnings would result 

mmc has funding requirements for the us nonqualified and uk plans in 2005 of approximately 19 million and 94 million respectively mmc’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable foreign law there currently is no erisa funding requirement for the us qualified plan in 2005 or in 2006 funding requirements for nonus plans vary country by country 

during 2005 mmc contributed approximately 229 million to the us pension plans and 498 million to the significant nonus pension plans compared with 44 million for us plans and 239 million for significant nonus plans in 2004 the contributions in 2005 include discretionary contributions of 8 million unregistered shares of mmc stock valued at 205 million to the us qualified plan and 235 million of cash to the uk plans these contributions resulted in an increase in prepaid pension expense for certain plans the minimum pension liability related to any plan is recorded as part of the pension postretirement and postemployment liability in the consolidated balance sheets 

during 2005 the net funded status of the us and significant nonus pension plans increased by 299 million and 303 million respectively due primarily to the discretionary contributions mentioned previously in addition changes made to the us pension plan discussed below under “management’s discussion of critical accounting policies — retirement benefits” reduced the benefit obligation of that plan by 138 million and a plan curtailment in the uk reduced the benefit obligations of nonus plans by 40 million benefit obligations of the us and significant nonus pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 79 million and 818 million respectively at december 31 2005 contribution rates are determined by the local foreign actuaries based on local funding practices and requirements funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance discount rates and other variables impacting the assets andor liabilities of the plan in addition amounts funded in the future to the extent not required under regulatory requirements may be affected by alternative uses of mmc’s cash flows including dividends investments and share repurchases 

under generally accepted accounting principles if the accumulated benefit obligation of a plan exceeds the fair value of that plan’s assets an “abo deficit” an additional minimum liability is recorded for the amount of the abo deficit the additional minimum liability plus the amount of prepaid pension cost recognized for that plan is charged to other comprehensive income equity net of applicable taxes at december 31 2005 mmc has prepaid pension costs of approximately 16 billion which relate primarily to the us qualified plan and two uk plans as well as some smaller plans in various countries 

financing cash flows 

net cash provided by financing activities was 128 million in 2005 compared with 12 billion in 2004 

in december 2005 mmc and certain of its foreign subsidiaries entered into a new 12 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility subsidiary borrowings under the facility are unconditionally guaranteed by mmc the facility which will expire in december 2010 replaces mmc’s 10 billion and 700 million revolving credit facilities which were scheduled to expire in 2007 and 2009 respectively certain of mmc’s foreign subsidiaries borrowed approximately 510 million under the new facility primarily to fund the repatriation of accumulated earnings pursuant to the american jobs creation act of 2004 

in september 2005 mmc returned to the public capital markets issuing 550 million of 515 senior notes due 2010 and 750 million of 575 senior notes due 2015 the “2005 notes” the net proceeds from the 2005 notes were used to pay down the 13 billion term loan facility discussed below 

also in september 2005 mmc refinanced its headquarters building in new york city by entering into a 30year 475 million mortgage loan agreement at a fixed annual rate of 57 this replaced the existing 200 million 98 mortgage due in 2009 the incremental proceeds net of a 34 million prepayment charge were used to pay down outstanding shortterm debt 

in december 2004 mmc completed financing with respect to a 13 billion term loan facility and the amendment of its existing 1 billion revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in june 2007 and 700 million revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in june 2009 the term loan facility which was repaid with proceeds from the issuance of the 2005 notes was scheduled to mature on december 31 2006 and replaced revolving credit facilities of 700 million and 355 million which were scheduled to expire in 2005 

mmc’s senior debt is currently rated baa2 by moody’s and bbb by standard  poor’s mmc’s shortterm debt is currently rated p2 by moody’s and a2 by standard  poor’s mmc carries a negative outlook from both moody’s and standard  poor’s 

in july 2004 mmc issued 650 million of 5375 senior notes due 2014 and 500 million of floating rate notes due 2007 the proceeds from these notes were used to repay the commercial paper borrowings that were used to purchase kroll 

mmc paid total dividends of 363 million in 2005 068 per share and 681 million 130 per share in 2004 mmc made no share repurchases in 2005 in 2004 mmc repurchased 114 million shares for 524 million substantially all of which was purchased in the first and second quarters 

mmc also maintains other credit facilities guarantees and letters of credit with various banks primarily related to operations located outside the united states aggregating 354 million at december 31 2005 and 331 million at december 31 2004 there was 83 million outstanding under these facilities at december 31 2005 

investing cash flows 

cash provided by investing activities amounted to 153 million in 2005 compared with cash used for investing activities of 26 billion in 2004 cash used for acquisitions decreased to 74 million from 24 billion in 2004 acquisitions in 2004 included kroll inc synhrgy hr technologies corporate systems and the australia and new zealand operations of heath lambert remaining deferred cash payments of approximately 48 million related to acquisitions completed in 2005 and prior years are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2005 in addition cash generated by the sale of securities totaled 333 million in 2005 versus 199 million for 2004 

mmc’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software which amounted to 345 million in 2005 and 376 million in 2004 primarily relate to computer equipment purchases the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs 

mmc has committed to potential future investments of approximately 295 million in connection with various private equity funds and other mmc investments commitments of 112 million relate to trident iii a private equity fund managed by stone point mmc’s funding commitment to trident iii decreased by approximately 98 million upon the sale of the business of mmc capital to the management team of stone point on may 31 2005 mmc’s remaining commitments relate to other funds managed by stone point approximately 82 million and by putnam through thl and thlpc approximately 101 million trident iii closed in december 2003 and has an investment period of six years mmc does not control or know the timing of capital calls that stone point will make on trident iii’s investors typically the investment period for funds of this type has been about four 

years which would indicate an expected capital call of approximately 35–50 million per year actual capital calls may occur more quickly the majority of mmc’s other investment commitments for funds managed by stone point are related to trident ii the investment period for which is now closed for new investments any remaining capital calls for trident ii would relate to followon investments in existing portfolio companies or for management fees or other partnership expenses significant future capital calls related to trident ii are not expected although it is anticipated that trident ii will be harvesting its remaining portfolio in 2006 and thereafter the timing of any portfolio company sales and capital distributions is unknown and not controlled by mmc 

putnam has investment commitments of 101 million for three active thl funds of which putnam believes approximately 50 million will not be called putnam is authorized to commit to invest up to 187 million in future thl investment funds but is not required to do so at december 31 2005 none of that additional 187 million is committed 

approximately 77 million was invested in 2005 related to all of the commitments discussed above 

commitments and obligations 

mmc’s contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december 31 2005 dollars in millions 

 market risk 

certain of mmc’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets 

interest rate risk 

mmc manages its net exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing a mixture of variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance mmc’s asset base mmc uses interest rate swaps on a limited basis to manage exposure to interest rate movements on its cash and investments as well as interest expense on borrowings rate swaps are only executed with highly creditworthy counterparties 

mmc had the following investments and debt instruments subject to variable interest rates 

 48 

these investments and debt instruments are discussed more fully in the aboveindicated notes to the consolidated financial statements 

based on the above balances if shortterm interest rates increase by 10 or 40 basis points over the course of the year annual interest income including interest earned on fiduciary funds would increase by approximately 14 million however this would be partially offset by a 3 million increase in interest expense resulting in a net increase to income before income taxes and minority interest of 11 million 

foreign currency risk 

the translated values of revenue and expense from mmc’s international risk and insurance services and consulting operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates we periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business 

equity price risk 

mmc holds investments in public and private companies as well as in certain private equity funds managed by stone point including trident ii and trident iii publicly traded investments of 143 million are classified as available for sale under sfas no 115 nonpublicly traded investments of 54 million and 365 million are accounted for under apb opinion no 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” using the cost method and the equity method respectively changes in value of trading securities are recognized in income when they occur the investments that are classified as available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of changes in market value which if determined to be other than temporary could result in realized impairment losses mmc periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements 

other 

a significant number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

management’s discussion of critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding mmc’s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from those estimates 

legal and other loss contingencies 

mmc and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims lawsuits and proceedings gaap requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant management judgment is required to comply with this guidance mmc analyzes its litigation exposure based on available information including consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of these matters to assess its potential liability 

in addition to the extent that insurance coverage is available significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are expected under mmc’s various insurance programs 

retirement benefits 

mmc maintains qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for its us and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for eligible nonus employees mmc’s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us and applicable foreign laws 

the determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and assumed rate of salary increase significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements mmc believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate actuarial assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate pension expense in 2005 increased by 130 million compared with 2004 based on its current assumptions mmc expects pension expense to decrease by approximately 12 million in 2006 and currently expects to contribute approximately 145 million to the plans during the year 

during 2005 mmc made changes to the us pension plan that were designed to reduce mmc’s benefits costs going forward the changes which are effective january 1 2006 include changing the benefit formula from a final average salary to a career average salary as well as a change in the calculation for early retirement benefits these changes do not affect pension benefits earned as of december 31 2005 

future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions future investment performance future assumptions and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans holding all other assumptions constant a halfpercentage point change in the rate of return and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the us and uk plans which comprise approximately 90 of total pension plan liabilities as follows 

 changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense because the longterm rates of inflation and salary increases are correlated with the discount rate 

mmc contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees the cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the united states is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire but is funded by mmc as incurred this postretirement liability is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets the key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

mmc’s tax rate reflects its income statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating tax positions tax allowances are established when despite the belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable there is the potential that they may be successfully challenged these allowances as well as the related interest are adjusted to reflect changing facts and circumstances 

tax law requires items be included in mmc’s tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that future taxable income will be insufficient to use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements 

sharebased payment

     mmc capital mmc capital is a private equity firm that manages investments
and committed capital of more than 2 billion during the past ten years
mmc capital has targeted investments in the insurance and financial services
industries as the investment manager of the trident funds which consist of the
trident partnership formed in 1994 trident ii formed in 1999 and trident iii
formed in 2003 investors in these funds include mmc capitals corporate parent
and other investors

         mmc capitals investment activities date back to the mid1980s when mmc
was instrumental in sponsoring several bermudabased insurance and reinsurance
companies including ace limited xl capital ltd centre reinsurance holdings
limited and mid ocean limited more recently mmc capital helped to develop an
additional source of insurance and reinsurance capacity after the september 11
2001 terrorist attacks through the formation of axis capital holdings limited

         as a result of the foregoing activities subsidiaries and affiliates of
mmc may have direct or indirect investments in insurance and reinsurance
companies including entities at lloyds which are considered for client
placements by mmcs insurance and reinsurance brokerage businesses

         on february 28 2005 mmc signed a letter of intent providing for the
transfer of mmc capitals business including the management of the trident
funds to a company to be formed by mmc capitals senior management including
its chairman and chief executive officer mmc will maintain a strategic alliance
with the acquisition company and continue certain of its investments in the
trident funds in addition mmc may maintain its investments in certain
insurance and reinsurance companies

     compensation for services
     

     the revenue attributable to mmcs risk and insurance services consisted
primarily of fees paid by clients commissions and fees paid by insurance and
reinsurance companies and compensation for billing and related services in the
form of interest income on funds held in a fiduciary capacity for others such
as premiums and claims proceeds revenue in 2004 also included market service
fees from insurers earned prior to october 1 2004

     revenue generated by risk and insurance services depends on the value to
clients of the services provided these revenues are affected by premium rate
levels in the property and casualty and employee benefits insurance markets
since compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds in
many cases compensation may be negotiated in advance on the basis of the
estimated value of the services to be performed revenue is also affected by
fluctuations in the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients
themselves and by insured values the development of new products markets and
services new and lost business merging of clients including insurance
companies that are clients in the reinsurance intermediary business and the
volume of business from new and existing clients as well as by the level of
interest realized on the investment of fiduciary funds and foreign exchange
rate fluctuations

     market services revenue had been part of the overall compensation for
marshs services in 2004 effective october 1 2004 marsh agreed to eliminate
contingent compensation

page


agreements with insurers no such compensation will be earned for placements
made after october 1 2004

         commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or
reinsurance coverage provided the particular insurer or reinsurer the capacity
in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients in some cases clients
pay marsh fees for brokerage or advisory services occasionally commissions are
shared with other brokers that have participated in placing insurance or
servicing insureds

         the investment of fiduciary funds is governed by the applicable laws or
regulations of insurance authorities of the states in the united states and in
other jurisdictions in which mmcs subsidiaries do business these laws and
regulations typically govern the manner in which such funds must be segregated
and limit the type of investments that may be made with such funds the amount
of funds invested and interest rates vary from time to time

         compensation for the various risk consulting and related risk
mitigation services provided by kroll subsidiaries consists of fees paid by
clients kroll charges such fees typically on an hourly project or fixed fee
basis and sometimes on a per service or per unit basis compensation for risk
and insurance services also was received by mmc capital in connection with the
organization structuring and management of insurance financial services and
other industryfocused investments including fees and dividends as well as
appreciation or depreciation that has been recognized on holdings in such
entities

principal underwriter of the shares of the openend putnam funds selling
primarily through independent brokerdealers financial planners and financial
institutions including banks and directly to certain large 401k plans and
other institutional accounts shares of openend funds are generally sold to
investors at their respective net asset value per share plus a sales charge
which varies depending on the individual fund and the amount and class of shares
purchased in some cases the sales charge is assessed only if the shares are
redeemed within a stated time period in accordance with certain terms and
conditions described in the prospectuses for these funds certain investors are
eligible to purchase shares at net asset value or at reduced sales charges and
investors may generally exchange their shares of a fund at net asset value for
shares of another putnam fund without paying additional sales charges

         all openend putnam funds other than a money market fund have adopted
and put in place distribution plans pursuant to rule 12b1 under the investment
company act of 1940 pursuant to these distribution plans the putnam funds make
payments to prm to cover costs relating to distribution of the putnam funds and

compensation for the costs of distribution and other services provided by putnam
and its affiliates to shareholders and for commissions advanced by putnam at the
point of sale and recovered through fees received over time to firms that
distribute shares of the putnam funds these 12b1 distribution plans and
payments made by the putnam funds thereunder are subject to annual renewal by
the trustees and to termination by vote of the shareholders of the putnam funds
or by vote of a majority of the trustees who are not affiliated with putnam
failure of the trustees to approve continuation of the rule 12b1 plans for
class b deferred sales charge shares would have a material adverse effect on
putnams business and results of operations the trustees also have the ability
to reduce the level of 12b1 fees paid by a fund or to make other changes that
would reduce the amount of 12b1 fees received by putnam such changes could
have a material adverse effect on putnams business and results of operations

     compensation for services putnams revenue is derived primarily from
investment management and 12b1 fees received from the putnam funds and
investment management fees for institutional accounts investment management
revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under
management assets under management and revenue levels are particularly affected
by fluctuations in domestic and international stock and bond market prices the
composition of assets under management and by the level of investments and
withdrawals for current and new fund shareholders and clients us equity
markets showed modest appreciation in 2004 following substantial growth in the
second half of 2003 prior to the second half of 2003 us equity markets
declined steadily for over three years in 2004 assets under management
continued to be adversely affected by and may continue to be adversely affected
in the future by increased redemptions in response to the underperformance of
certain putnam funds relative to competing products in the mutual fund
marketplace and the market timing related issues and other events that gave rise
to the administrative proceedings brought by the securities and exchange
commission sec and the massachusetts secretary of the commonwealth in the
fourth quarter of 2003 these proceedings and the settlement thereof are
discussed in more detail in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements
included under item 8 of this report items affecting revenue also include but
are not limited to actual and relative investment performance service to
clients the development and marketing of new investment products the relative
attractiveness of the investment style under prevailing market conditions
changes in the investment patterns of clients and the ability to maintain
investment management and administrative fees at current levels

         revenue levels are sensitive to all of the factors above but in
particular to significant changes in bond and stock market valuations and net
flows into and out of putnams funds fluctuations in the prices of stocks will
have an effect on equity assets under management and may influence the flow of
monies to and from equity funds and accounts fluctuations in interest rates and
in the yield curve have a similar effect on fixed income assets under management
and may influence the flow of monies to and from fixedincome funds and
accounts

competitive conditions


         principal methods of competition in risk and insurance services and
consulting include the quality and types of services and products that a broker
or consultant provides its clients and their cost putnam competes with other
providers of investment products and services primarily on the basis of the
range of investment products offered the investment performance of such
products the manner in which such products are distributed the scope and
quality of the shareholder and other services provided and its general
reputation in the marketplace


                                      12

sales of putnam fund shares are also influenced by general securities market
conditions government regulations global economic conditions and advertising
and sales promotional efforts all of these businesses also encounter strong
competition from both public corporations and private firms in attracting and
retaining qualified employees

     risk and insurance services the combined insurance and reinsurance broking
services business of mmc is the largest of its type in the world

         mmc encounters strong competition in the risk and insurance services
business from other insurance brokerage firms which also operate on a nationwide
or worldwide basis from a large number of regional and local firms in the
united states the european union and in other countries and regions from
insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance
products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses
including commercial and investment banks accounting firms and consultants that
provide riskrelated services and products

         certain insureds and groups of insureds have established programs of
self insurance including captive insurance companies as a supplement or
alternative to thirdparty insurance thereby reducing in some cases the need
for insurance placements there are also many other providers of affinity group
and private client services including specialized firms as well as insurance
companies and other institutions

         kroll competes with other national and international firms that provide
similar services in the fields of accounting corporate advisory and
restructuring services investigative and security services consulting and
technology services

         mmc capital competes with other organizations that set up private
equity funds to structure and manage investments in the insurance industry
these organizations include insurance companies brokers and other market
participants as disclosed above on february 28 2005 mmc signed a letter of
intent providing for the transfer of mmc capitals business including the
management of the trident funds to a company to be formed by mmc capitals
senior management the transfer is expected to close by the end of the second
quarter 2005

     investment management putnam investments is one of the largest investment
management firms in the united states the investment management business is
highly competitive in addition to competition from firms already in the
investment management business including public and private firms commercial
banks stock brokerage and investment banking firms and insurance companies
there is competition from other firms offering financial services and other
investment alternatives although putnam investments has expanded its marketing
and distribution outside the us it competes in nonus markets with local
and global firms many of whom have much larger investment management businesses
in their respective nonus markets putnams competitive position continued to
be adversely affected in 2004 and may continue to be adversely affected in the
future by the underperformance of certain putnam funds relative to competing
products in the mutual fund marketplace

         many securities dealers whose large retail distribution systems play
an important role in the sale of shares in the putnam funds also sponsor
competing proprietary mutual funds to the extent that such securities dealers
value the ability to offer customers a broad selection of


                                      13
page


investment alternatives they will continue to sell independent funds
notwithstanding the availability of proprietary products however to the extent
that these firms limit or restrict the sale of putnam fund shares through their
brokerage systems in favor of their proprietary mutual funds assets under
management might decline and putnams revenues might be adversely affected in
addition a number of mutual fund sponsors presently market their funds to the
general public without sales charges certain firms also offer passively managed
funds such as index funds to the general public

         in 2004 putnams competitive position was adversely affected and may
continue to be adversely affected in the future by the market timing related
issues and other events that gave rise to the administrative proceedings brought
by the sec and the massachusetts secretary of the commonwealth in the fourth
quarter of 2003 these proceedings and the settlement thereof are discussed in
more detail in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included under
item 8 of this report the management team at putnam is committed to restoring

recent developments

the historical financial results presented below should be viewed in light of
recent developments which have significantly impacted mmcs results of
operations liquidity and financial condition

marsh developments

on october 14 2004 the new york state attorney generals office nyag
filed a civil complaint the nyag lawsuit in state court against mmc
and marsh collectively marsh asserting claims under new york law for
fraudulent business practices antitrust violations securities fraud unjust
enrichment and common law fraud on october 21 2004 the new york state
insurance department nysid issued a citation amended on october 24 2004
the amended citation that ordered mmc and a number of its subsidiaries and
affiliates that hold new york insurance licenses to appear at a hearing and show
cause why regulatory action should not be taken against them these issues are
discussed more fully in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements


                                      27

on january 30 2005 mmc entered into an agreement the settlement agreement
with the nyag and the nysid to settle the nyag lawsuit and the amended citation
pursuant to the settlement agreement marsh will establish a fund of 850
million the fund payable over four years for marsh policyholder clients
mmc recorded a 232 million charge in the third quarter of 2004 and an
additional 618 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2004 for the amount to
be paid into the fund in accordance with the settlement agreement in addition
mmc recorded a charge of 16 million for estimated costs to calculate and
administer payments out of the fund the total amount of the settlement will be
paid into the fund as follows on or before each of june 1 2005 and 2006 255
million and on or before each of june 1 2007 and 2008 170 million

marsh has changed its business model to require complete transparency to clients
of all fees and remuneration to be received by marsh for performing its
services effective october 1 2004 marsh agreed to eliminate contingent
compensation agreements with insurers as a result market services revenue
msas declined to 541 million in 2004 from 845 million in the prior year
due to the filing of the attorney generals civil complaint marsh was unable
to complete the normal process to verify amounts earned or determine that
collection of these amounts is reasonably assured for certain contracts as a
result marsh did not accrue a significant portion of market services revenue
related to placement activity in the third quarter although some insurance
companies have indicated they may delay payments until the issues concerning
market services agreements are clarified marsh intends to collect market
services revenue earned prior to october 1 2004 any such revenue earned but
not accrued at september 30 2004 will be recognized when collected or when
confirmation of the amount of payment is received from the carriers market
services revenue of 73 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 no
market services revenue will be earned for placements made after october 1
2004 marsh is refining the details of its new business model and does not
anticipate realizing the benefits from its implementation until later in 2005
although mmc expects to be fairly and fully compensated for the services
it provides there is no assurance that revenues under the new model will be
sufficient to achieve operating margins and cash flows that are comparable to
historical levels in addition client revenue may also be reduced due to
negative reaction to the issues raised in the complaint

mmc developments

on october 25 2004 michael cherkasky was named president and chief executive
officer of mmc and was elected to mmcs board of directors robert erburu was
named lead director of the mmc board of directors

on november 18 2004 mmc announced that five members of its board of directors
who were also executives of the company stepped down from their positions on
the board after this action mmcs board consists of michael cherkasky the
companys president and chief executive officer and ten outside members

in addition to these changes mmc has taken a number of steps to enhance the
control and compliance environment

across all of its businesses mmc must preserve its capabilities to serve
clients and the capacity to support staff development retention of employees is
critical to the organization as a result mmc has developed compensation
programs to retain motivate and reward certain key employees these programs
resulted in 12 million of additional compensation


                                      28

expense in the fourth quarter of 2004 and will potentially increase compensation
costs in 2005 by approximately 110 million

mmc is conducting an ongoing examination of all parts of its cost structure to
identify areas where expenses can be reduced appropriately on a global basis
mmc has reducedheadcount by 2750 in the fourth quarter 2004 through staff
reductions and attrition these actions are expected to result in annual savings
of approximately 400 million when fully implemented in mid2005 as a result of
these actions pretax costs of 337 million were incurred in the fourth quarter
of 2004 primarily related to severance and other termination benefits and
future rent under noncancelable leases and lease termination costs as well as
14 million for costs related to accelerated amortization or abandonment of
leasehold improvements and other assets additional costs of 14 million are
expected to be incurred in the first half of 2005 related to the 2004
restructuring activity marsh inc continues to restructure its operations
improve efficiencies and eliminate unprofitable accounts  this could affect
approximately 2500 people throughout its global operations and when fully
implemented should lead to annual expense savings exceeding 375 million
this will result in additional restructuring charges

following the filing of the nyag lawsuit uncertainty regarding changes in
marshs business model the impact of eliminating contingent compensation
agreements and potential fines andor penalties resulted in credit rating
downgrades and the inability to access commercial paper markets the matters
raised in the nyag lawsuit may have prohibited mmc from borrowing under its
revolving facilities  the required lenders under each of the facilities
agreed to waive the effect of such matters until december 30 2004
during the period from october 14 to december 15 2004 the revolving credit
facilities were drawn upon to refinance approximately 17 billion of maturing
commercial paper on december 15 2004 mmc completed financing with respect
to a 13 billion twoyear term loan facility and the amendment of its
existing 1 billion revolving credit facility which expires in june 2007
and 700 million revolving credit facility which expires in june 2009
the term loan was used to pay down balances on the revolving credit facilities
mmcs debt and credit facilities are discussed in more detail in the liquidity
and capital resources section of this mda

putnam developments

on november 13 2003 pursuant to an agreement with putnam the securities and
exchange commission sec entered findings of fact which putnam neither
admitted nor denied that putnam had violated the investment advisors act of
1940 and the investment company act of 1940

on april 8 2004 putnam entered into a settlement of those charges under which
putnam was required to pay 5 million in restitution plus a civil monetary
penalty of 50 million the settlement provided that if the restitution
calculated by the independent assessment consultant under the sec order exceeded
10 million putnam would be responsible for paying the excess

on april 8 2004 simultaneously and in conjunction with the settlement of the
abovereferenced sec proceeding the massachusetts secretary of the commonwealth
massachusetts security division entered a consent order in final settlement
of charges filed against putnam and two of its employees on october 28 2003 by
the massachusetts security division alleging violations of the states
securities law antifraud provision that consent order provided that if the


                                      29
page


restitution calculated by the independent assessment consultant under the
massachusetts order exceeded 15 million putnam would be responsible for paying
the excess the restitution called for by the consent order will be distributed
by the same independent assessment consultant appointed pursuant to the november
13 2003 and april 8 2004 sec orders acting in his capacity as the independent
distribution consultant under the orders

on march 3 2005 the independent assessment consultant issued his assessment
reports dated march 2 2005 under the sec orders and the massachusetts
consent order  in the reports the independent assessment consultant concluded
that 1085 million is the total amount of restitution payable by putnam to fund
shareholders  putnam will pay 25 million of this amount from the amounts
previously made available for restitution under the sec and massachusetts
orders and has recorded a charge for the additional 835 million in the fourth
quarter of 2004  in addition to the 1085 million in restitution putnam fund
shareholders will also receive a distribution of 45 million which will be
taken from the civil penalty putnam previously paid to the sec and does not
reflect an additional payment  the independent assessment consultant in his
capacity as the independent distribution consultant under april 8 2004 sec
order and the massachusetts consent order is continuing his work on a
distribution plan that will provide for the distribution of the restitution
amounts described above to putnam fund shareholders  putnam will incur
additional costs in connection with the implementation of the distribution plan

revenue derived mainly from commissions and fees increased 5 from 2003 the
increase in revenue was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and foreign
exchange consolidated revenue decreased 3 on an underlying basis which
measures the change in revenue before the impact of acquisitions and
dispositions and using constant currency exchange rates underlying revenue
growth in consulting was more than offset by a decrease in investment management
revenue due to a decline in average assets under management and a decrease in
risk and insurance services revenue resulting from the elimination of msas

revenue increased 8 in risk and insurance services acquisitions including the
acquisition of kroll contributed 7 to the segments revenue growth revenue in
this segment declined 2 on an underlying basis in 2004 resulting primarily from
the 304 million decline in msa revenues which more than offset a 3 increase in
client revenue and fiduciary income related insurance services reflects growth
in claims management and higher investment income at mmc capital consulting
revenue grew 3 on an underlying basis higher demand for strategic advice
generated an increase in management and organizational change consulting
acquisitions contributed 4 to the revenue growth of consulting largely
reflecting the acquisition of synhrgy hr technologies completed in january
2004 and oliver wyman completed in april 2003 revenue decreased 12 in the
investment management segment due to a decline in the amount of average assets
under management on which fees are earned and lower 12b1 fees partially offset
by higher investment income related to the sale of putnams interest in its
italian joint venture and related securities and by transaction fees related to
private equity funds average assets under management declined 16 in 2004
compared with 2003

operating expenses increased 27 in 2004 over 2003 of which 10 was due to the
effects of acquisitions and foreign exchange expenses in 2004 also include an
850 million charge related to the settlement agreement with the nyag and the
nysid charges of 224 million related to putnams settlement agreements with
the sec and the massachusetts security division costs of 337 million related
to restructuring mmcs businesses partly offset by a credit of 105 million from
the final settlement with insurers for claims related to the september 11 2001
attack on the wtc combined these items increased expenses by 14 underlying
expenses excluding these items increased 3 due to higher compensation and
benefits costs which includes severance of 108 million incurred prior to
implementation of the restructuring plan in the fourth quarter and increased
pension costs of 93 million as well as other costs related to regulatory
issues these increases were partially offset by a decrease in amortization
expense for prepaid dealer commissions and a credit to compensation expense
related to the settlement with putnams former chief executive officer

the 6 growth in underlying revenue in 2003 was primarily driven by higher
renewal revenue and market services revenue and the impact of higher premiums in
the risk and insurance services segment combined with growth in each of the
practices of the consulting segment offsetting this growth was an 8 decrease
in the investment management segment due to a decline in the amount of assets
under management on which fees are earned and a decline in underwriting and
distribution fees

operating expenses increased 11 in 2003 5 on an underlying basis the
increase in underlying expenses was driven by higher compensation and benefit
costs in risk and insurance services as well as higher facility and insurance
costs partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense for prepaid dealer
commissions

risk and insurance services

mmcs risk and insurance services are provided by its subsidiaries and their
affiliates as broker agent or consultant for insureds insurance underwriters
and other brokers on a worldwide basis in the areas of risk management and
insurance broking reinsurance broking and services risk consulting and
technology services and related insurance services risk management and
consulting insurance broking and insurance program management services are
provided for businesses public entities associations professional services
organizations and private clients under the marsh name reinsurance broking
catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions are
conducted for insurance and reinsurance companies principally under the guy
carpenter name risk consulting and technology services are provided to
businesses governments and individuals throughout the world primarily under
the kroll name underwriting management and wholesale broking services are
performed for a wide range of clients under various names the largest of which
is crump claims and associated productivity services are provided by sedgwick
claims management services in addition mmc capital provides services
principally in connection with originating structuring and managing insurance
financial services and other industryfocused investments

revenue attributable to the risk and insurance services segment consists
primarily of fees paid by clients commissions and fees paid by insurance and
reinsurance companies and compensation for billing and related services in the
form of interest income on funds held in a fiduciary capacity for others such
as premiums and claims proceeds results in 2004 also include msa revenue
earned prior to october 1 2004 mmc eliminated msas effective october 1 2004
compensation for the various risk consulting and related risk mitigation
services provided by kroll subsidiaries consists of fees paid by clients
typically charged on an hourly project or fixed fee basis and sometimes on a
per service or per unit basis revenue also includes compensation for services
provided by mmc capital in connection with the organization structuring and
management of insurance financial services and other industryfocused
investments including fees and dividends as well as appreciation or
depreciation that has been recognized on holdings in such entities

revenue generated by the risk and insurance services segment depends on the
value to clients of the services provided these revenues are affected by
premium rate levels in the property and casualty and employee benefits insurance
markets since compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by
insureds in many cases compensation may be negotiated in advance on the basis
of the estimated value of the services to be performed revenue is also affected
by fluctuations in the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance
clients themselves and by insured values the development of new products
markets and services new and lost business merging of clients and the volume
of business from new and existing clients as well as by the level of interest
realized on the investment of fiduciary funds and foreign exchange rate
fluctuations

as previously discussed mmc is making several changes to its risk and insurance
business model these changes include complete transparency to clients of all
fees and remuneration to be received by marsh and effective october 1 agreed to
eliminate contingent compensation agreements with insurers although mmc expects
to be fairly and fully compensated for the services it provides there is no
assurance that revenues under the new model will be sufficient to achieve
operating margins and cash flows that are comparable to historical levels in
addition client revenue may also be reduced due to negative reaction to the
issues raised in the complaint

revenue for the risk and insurance services segment grew 8 in 2004 over 2003
acquisitions principally kroll along with other smaller acquisitions
contributed 7 to revenue growth underlying revenue declined 2 in risk
management and insurance broking underlying revenue decreased 6 primarily due
to a reduction in msas discussed in more detail below client revenue increased
1 reflecting a 3 growth in europe and 4 growth in other international
markets partially offset by a 2 decline in north america underlying revenue
in reinsurance broking increased 3 related insurance services revenue
increased 12 on an underlying basis resulting from an increase in claims
management and higher investment income at mmc capital

effective october 1 2004 marsh agreed to eliminate contingent compensation
agreements with insurers as a result market services revenue declined to 541
million in 2004 from 845 million in the prior year due to the filing of the
nyag lawsuit mmc was unable to complete the normal process to verify amounts
earned or determine that collection of these amounts is reasonably assured for
certain contracts as a result mmc did not accrue a significant portion of
market services revenue related to placement activity in the third quarter
although some insurance companies have indicated they may delay payments until
the issues concerning market services agreements are clarified mmc intends to
collect market services revenue earned prior to october 1 2004 any such
revenue earned but not accrued at september 30 2004 will be recognized when
collected or when confirmation of the amount of payment is received from the
carriers no market services revenue will be earned for placements made after
october 1 2004 the following table provides quarterly msa revenue for 2003 and

increases in the underwriting management and claims management businesses were
partially offset by a decrease in affinity business and lower investment income
at mmc capital

expense

in 2004 risk and insurance services expenses increased 40 over 2003
approximately 16 of the increase is due to an 850 million charge for the
settlement agreement with the nyag and the nysid and legal and other costs of
31 million related to this matter expenses in 2004 include restructuring
charges of 231 million including severance and other termination benefits
future rent under noncancellable leases and lease termination costs and
incremental amortization of 7 million related to accelerated amortization or
abandonment of leasehold improvements annual cost savings of 271 million are
expected when the restructuring is fully implemented expenses in 2004 also
include 8 million for employee retention programs which will increase 2005
compensation expenses by 75 million in connection with accounting guidance
issued by the institute of chartered accountants in the uk mmc reassessed its
obligation to provide future claims handling and certain administrative services
for brokerage clients in the european marketplace mmc has determined that under
certain circumstances it is obligated to provide such services based on its
current business practices in the fourth quarter mmc recorded a pretax charge
of approximately 65 million to reflect the change in estimated cost to provide
these services this charge does not result in any incremental cash outflow for
the company the effects of acquisitions and foreign exchange increased expenses
by 14 on an underlying basis excluding the items previously discussed
expenses increased 4 compensation and benefits increased by 5 primarily due
to increased pension and benefits costs and other operating expenses increased
1

marsh inc continues to restructure its operations improve efficiencies and
eliminate unprofitable accounts  this could affect approximately 2500 people
throughout its global operations and when fully implemented should lead to
annual expense savings exceeding 375 million  this will result in additional
restructuring charges

in 2003 risk and insurance services expenses increased 16 over 2002 11 on an
underlying basis expense growth results primarily from higher compensation and
benefit costs reflecting increased headcount and higher incentive compensation
expenses along with an increase in costs for facilities and insurance

acquisition

in july 2004 mmc acquired kroll inc the worlds leading provider of risk
mitigation services the combination of marsh and kroll expands mmcs
capabilities to assist clients in managing the total cost of risk the total
cost of the acquisition was 19 billion in addition during the year mmc made
several smaller acquisitions in the risk and insurance services segment at an
aggregate cost of 250 million

revenue

putnams revenue decreased 12 in 2004 reflecting a decrease in fees due to a
decline in average assets under management partially offset by higher investment
gains higher equity income resulting from thl transaction fees related to
private equity investments and increased transfer agent fees assets under
management averaged 217 billion for the year ended december 31 2004 a 16
decline from the 258 billion managed in 2003 assets under management
aggregated 213 billion at december 31 2004 compared with 240 billion at
december 31 2003 the change from december 31 2003 primarily results from net
redemptions of 51 billion partly offset by increases due to market
appreciation of 16 billion and the consolidation of panagora 8 billion

putnam receives service fees from the putnam funds for transfer agency custody
and other administrative services as contracted by the trustees of the putnam
funds in the third quarter of 2004 the contract for transfer agency services
was converted from an expense reimbursement basis to a fixed fee for the
remainder of 2004  the change in the service fee calculation resulted in an
increase in both service fee revenue and expenses of approximately 41 million
during the second half of 2004 the change in the service fee contract is
expected to have an immaterial impact on operating income in future quarters
but will reduce operating margins by approximately 100 basis points from
previous levels

at the end of 2004 assets held in equity securities represented 69 of assets
under management compared with 72 in 2003 and 73 in 2002 while investments
in fixed income products represented 31 compared with 28 in 2003 and 27 in
2002

putnams revenue decreased 8 in 2003 which is due to the effect of decreased
assets under management and a decline in underwriting and distribution fees
partially offset by higher investment income driven by investment gains from
trading securities in 2003 and a favorable comparison to 2002 which included a
charge for the decline in value of an available for sale security assets under
management averaged 258 billion in the year ended december 31 2003 an 8
decrease from the 279 billion managed during the year ended december 31 2002
assets under management aggregated 240 billion at december 31 2003 compared
with 251 billion at december 31 2002 the change from december 31 2002 was
primarily due to net redemptions of 61 billion partially offset by an increase
in equity market levels

the categories of mutual fund assets reflect style designations aligned with
each funds prospectus

assets under management and revenue levels are particularly affected by
fluctuations in domestic and international stock and bond market prices the
composition of assets under management and by the level of investments and
withdrawals for current and new fund shareholders and clients items affecting
revenue also include but are not limited to actual and relative investment
performance service to clients the development and marketing of new investment
products the relative attractiveness of the investment style under prevailing
market conditions changes in the investment patterns of clients and the ability
to maintain investment management and administrative fees at historic levels
future revenue may be adversely affected by continued net redemptions shifts in
asset style and share mix and by limits on fund expense ratios and front end
sales charges revenue levels are sensitive to all of the factors above but in
particular to significant changes in stock and bond market valuations and net
flows into or out of putnams funds

expense

expenses in 2004 increased 11 from 2003 expenses in 2004 include 224 million
for putnams regulatory settlements with the sec and the commonwealth of
massachusetts restructuring costs incurred by putnam in the fourth quarter
totaled 15 million other significant items recorded in 2004 were severance of
57 million incurred prior to the fourth quarter restructuring as well as
incremental costs related to regulatory issues and repositioning putnam
including legal and audit costs of 45 million and communications costs of 16
million in 2004 putnam discontinued the practice of directing brokerage
commissions and virtually eliminated the use of soft dollars causing expenses
to increase by approximately 40 million these increases were partially offset
by a decrease in amortization expense for prepaid dealer commissions and a 25
million credit to compensation expense associated with the settlement with
putnams former chief executive officer investment management expenses in 2004
also reflect costs of 16 million including 10 million of restructuring costs
related to a startup hedge fund management business at mmc that was
subsequently discontinued

in 2003 putnams expenses declined 6 compared to 2002 primarily due to lower
amortization expense for prepaid dealer commissions and lower impairment charges
related to intangible assets these reductions were partially offset by net
costs of approximately 24 million related to the investigation of market timing
in certain putnam funds including compliance legal and communication expenses
as well as estimated potential restitution to the putnam funds

acquisition

in july 2004 putnam acquired an additional 30 of the voting stock of panagora
asset management inc bringing its total interest to an 80 voting majority
panagora primarily offers index enhanced index and structured products which
typically have a lower level of management fees than putnams core products
this transaction increased putnams reported assets under management by
approximately 8 billion

revenue

consulting revenue in 2004 increased 13 over 2003 acquisitions which
accounted for 4 of the revenue growth in 2004 include synhrgy hr technologies
which closed in january 2004 and oliver wyman  company owc which closed

organizational change 1 in health care  group benefits and 1 in the human
capital practices underlying revenue growth in retirement services was flat

expense

consulting expenses increased 16 in 2004 compared to 2003 expenses in 2004
include restructuring charges of 62 million including severance and other
termination benefits and future rent under noncancellable leases and lease
termination costs as well as incremental expense of 7 million related to
accelerated amortization or abandonment of leasehold improvements and other
assets the restructuring activities are expected to result in annual cost
savings of 57 million when fully implemented expenses in 2004 also include 4
million for employee retention programs which will increase 2005 compensation
expense by 36 million in addition the impact of acquisitions and foreign
exchange increased expense by 11 on an underlying basis excluding the items
discussed above expenses increased 2 primarily due to higher employee
compensation and benefit costs

consulting services expenses increased 16 in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily
due to the impact of foreign exchange costs related to increased headcount
resulting from acquisitions and increased amortization expense for acquired
intangible assets as described in note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements a portion of the owc purchase consideration is contingent upon
future employment this amount has been accounted for as prepaid compensation
and is being recognized as compensation expense over four years consulting
services expenses increased 3 on an underlying basis due to higher facilities
and insurance costs

human resource technology and outsourcing services for a total cost of 115
million

corporate items

corporate expenses

corporate expenses in 2004 include costs of 18 million related to restructuring

expenses in 2004 the replacement value of the assets exceeded their book value
by 105 million which was recorded as a reduction of other operating expenses

corporate expenses increased to 140 million in 2003 from 123 million in 2002
due to increased compensation costs an increase in headcount and increased
costs for facilities and insurance

integration and restructuring charges

note 12 to the consolidated financial statements discusses integration and
restructuring costs in november 2004 mmc announced that it would undertake
restructuring initiatives involving staff reductions and consolidations of
facilities in response to mmcs current situation and the realities of the
marketplace on a global basis mmc has reduced staff by approximately 2750
these actions are expected to result in savings of approximately 400 million
when fully implemented in mid2005 as a result of these actions mmc incurred
pretax costs of 337 million primarily related to severance and other
termination benefits future rent under noncancellable leases and lease
termination costs and also incurred costs of 14 million related to accelerated
amortization or abandonment of leasehold improvements and other assets
additional costs of 14 million are expected to be incurred in the first half of
2005 related to the 2004 restructuring activity employee retention programs
will increase compensation costs in 2005 by approximately 110 million

marsh inc continues to restructure its operations improve efficiencies and
eliminate unprofitable accounts  this could affect approximately 2500 people
throughout its global operations and when fully implemented should lead to
annual expense savings exceeding 375 million  this will result in additional
restructuring charges

mmc previously incurred integration and restructuring costs related to the
acquisition of johnson  higgins jh in 1997 sedgwick in 1998 and a
restructuring plan in 2001 during 2004 mmc recorded the following payments as
well as adjustments related to changes in the estimated costs of integration and
restructuring plans a payment of 3 million for costs related to the sedgwick
plan and 4 million of the reserves were reversed by mmc and recorded as a
reduction of goodwill a payment of 2 million and a credit of 1 million for a
reduction in the estimated cost of the 1999 mmc plan related to the sedgwick
acquisition a payment of 3 million and a charge of 1 million for increased
costs related to the 2001 restructuring plan and 1 million of the reserves
were reversed by mmc and recorded as a reduction of goodwill and a charge of 4
million to reflect the current estimate for required lease payments related to
the jh acquisition the net impact of the charges and credits to integration
and restructuring reserves decreased diluted net income per share by
approximately onehalf of one cent for the year ended december 31 2004

interest

interest income earned on corporate funds was 21 million in 2004 compared with
24 million in 2003 interest expense increased from 185 million in 2003 to
219 million in 2004 the increase in interest expense is due primarily to an
increase in the amount of average outstanding debt

interest income earned on corporate funds was 24 million in 2003 compared with
19 million in 2002 interest expense increased to 185 million in 2003 from
160 million in 2002 the increase in interest income was primarily due to a
higher level of invested balances during 2003 partially offset by a decline in
the average interest rate earned the increase in interest expense is primarily
due to an increase in the average interest rates on outstanding debt the
increase in the average interest rate resulted from the conversion of a
significant portion of the companys debt from floating to fixed rates

income taxes

mmcs consolidated effective tax rate was 576 in 2004 an increase from 33
in 2003 the


                                      42
page


increase in the rate was primarily due to the nondeductibility of putnams 224
million in regulatory settlements a lower tax benefit related to marshs 850
million settlement of the nyag lawsuit due to partial attribution to foreign
operations and a partially offsetting benefit for foreign earnings taxed at
lower rates in 2002 the effective tax rate was 35 the decrease in the
effective rate in 2003 compared with 2002 results from the change in the
geographic mix of mmcs businesses and tax planning with respect to
international operations

in december 2004 the fasb issued staff position fsp no 1092 accounting
and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within
the american jobs creation act of 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004
the act signed into law on october 22 2004 provides for a special
onetime tax deduction or dividend received deduction drd of 85 of
qualifying foreign earnings that are repatriated in either a companys last tax
year that began before the enactment date or the first tax year that begins
during the oneyear period beginning on the enactment date fsp 1092 provides
entities additional time to assess the effect of repatriating foreign earnings
under the act for purposes of applying sfas no 109 accounting for income
taxes which typically requires the effect of a new tax law to be recorded in
the period of enactment mmc will elect if applicable to apply the drd to
qualifying dividends of foreign earnings repatriated in its calendar year 2005

mmc is awaiting further clarifying guidance from the us treasury department on
certain provisions of the act once this guidance is received mmc expects to
complete its evaluation of the effects of the act during 2005 under the
limitations on the amount of dividends qualifying for the drd of the act the
maximum repatriation of mmcs foreign earnings that may qualify for the special
onetime drd is approximately 12 billion therefore the range of possible
amounts of qualifying dividends of foreign earnings is between zero and
approximately 12 billion although the evaluation is ongoing mmc estimates
the range of income tax effects of potential repatriations to be zero to 63
million

liquidity and capital resources

operating cash flows

mmc generated 21 billion of cash from operations in 2004 compared with 19
billion in 2003 these amounts reflect the net income earned by mmc during those
periods adjusted for noncash charges and changes in working capital which
relate primarily to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts
of assets although net income declined significantly from the prior year a
number of charges recorded in 2004 have not yet been paid by mmc which
substantially offset the cash flow impact of the decline in operating income
these include 989 million of settlement costs in marsh and putnam and 278
million of restructuring costs which are recorded in the consolidated balance
sheet as accrued liabilities accounts payable other liabilities or accrued
salaries depending on the nature of the item cash flows from operations were
reduced by a higher amount of investment gains which are included in investing
cash flows an increase in 2004 of cash outflows related to payment of deferred
compensation plans was largely offset by cash generated from the liquidation of
assets related to these plans included in the change in other assets in the
consolidated statements of cash flows

effective october 1 2004 marsh agreed to eliminate contingent compensation
agreements with insurers at december 31 2004 accounts receivable related to
accrued market services revenue was 282 million subsequent to the filing of
the nyag lawsuit some insurance companies indicated they may delay payments
until the issues concerning market services


                                      43

agreements are clarified collection of previously accrued msa revenue may occur
more slowly than expected following the announcement of the settlement with the
nyag and the nysid mmc reaffirmed its intention to collect outstanding msa
revenue earned prior to october 2004 and will seek to enforce its rights under
the contracts to collect amounts due

for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 msa revenue was 541 million and
845 million respectively as discussed earlier marsh is revising its business
model so that revenue for all services provided is disclosed to clients
the elimination of msa revenue will negatively impact nearterm revenue and
operating income marsh is refining the details of its new business model and
does not anticipate realizing the benefits from its implementation until later
in 2005  although mmc expects to be fairly and fully compensated for the
services it provides there is no assurance that revenues under the new model
will be sufficient to achieve operating margins and cash flows that are
comparable to historical levels in addition client revenue may also be
reduced due to negative reaction to the issues raised in the complaint

as previously discussed mmc reached a settlement with the nyag and nysid that
resolved the actions by them that were commenced against mmc and marsh as a
result of this agreement mmc will establish an 850 million fund to compensate
clients of which 255 million will be paid to the fund on or before each of
june 1 2005 and 2006 respectively and 170 million will be paid to the fund
on or before each of june 1 2007 and 2008 respectively these amounts are
included in regulatory settlements on the consolidated balance sheets

mmc has funding requirements for the us nonqualified and uk plans in 2005
of approximately 18 million and 184 million respectively mmcs policy for
funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute
amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in us
and international law there currently is no erisa funding requirement for the
us qualified plan in 2004 or in 2005 funding requirements for nonus plans
vary country by country

during 2004 mmc contributed approximately 47 million to the us pension plans
and 239 million to the significant nonus pension plans compared with 21
million for us plans and 366 million for significant nonus plans in 2003
these contributions resulted in an increase in prepaid pension expense for
certain plans the minimum pension liability related to any plan is recorded in
other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets

during 2004 the net funded status of the us and significant nonus pension
plans decreased by 253 million and 389 million respectively due primarily to
higher actuarial losses benefit obligations of the us and significant
nonus pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 397 million
and 11 billion respectively at december 31 2004 the funded status at
december 31 2004 includes the effects of contributions made during the year
contribution rates are determined by the local foreign actuaries based on local
funding practices and requirements funding amounts may be influenced by future
asset performance discount rates and other variables impacting the assets
andor liabilities of the plan in addition amounts funded in the future to
the extent not required under regulatory requirements may be affected by
alternative uses of mmcs cash flows including dividends investments and
share repurchases

under generally accepted accounting principles if the accumulated benefit
obligation of a plan exceeds the fair value of that plans assets an abo
deficit an additional minimum liability is recorded the additional minimum
liability is equal to the abo deficit plus the amount of


                                      44
page


prepaid pension cost recognized for that plan the additional minimum liability
is established through a charge to other comprehensive income equity net of
applicable taxes at december 31 2004 mmc has prepaid pension costs of
approximately 14 billion which relate primarily to the us qualified plan and
two uk plans as well as some smaller plans in various countries

financing cash flows

net cash provided by financing activities was 12 billion in 2004 compared
with a 13 billion use of cash in 2003 the cash generated in 2004 relates
primarily to the issuance of long term debt to fund the acquisition of kroll
inc in july 2004 and the 13 billion term loan discussed below approximately
12 billion of net debt was added in 2004 compared with a slight reduction in
net debt in 2003

the matters raised in the nyag lawsuit on october 14 2004 described in note 15
of the consolidated financial statements may have prohibited mmc from borrowing
under its revolving facilities the required lenders under each of the
facilities agreed to waive the effect of such matters until december 30 2004
during the period from october 14 to december 15 2004 the revolving credit
facilities were drawn upon to refinance approximately 17 billion of maturing
commercial paper on december 15 2004 mmc completed financing with respect to
a 13 billion twoyear term loan facility and the amendment of its existing 1
billion revolving credit facility which expires in june 2007 and 700 million
revolving credit facility which expires in june 2009 the term loan facility
replaced mmcs existing oneyear facilities and the proceeds from this loan were
used to pay down the outstanding balances on revolving credit facilities at
december 31 2004 373 million was outstanding on the revolving credit
facilities

subsequent to the filing of the nyag lawsuit on october 14 2004 both moodys
and standard  poors have lowered their credit ratings on mmc mmcs senior
debt is currently rated baa2 by moodys and bbb by standard  poors these
ratings remain on review for possible further downgrade mmcs shortterm
ratings are currently p2 by moodys and a2 by standard  poors these ratings
also remain on review for possible further downgrade these rating actions will
result in increased borrowing costs for mmc

in 2004 mmc repurchased 114 million shares for 524 million substantially all
of which was purchased in the first and second quarter

dividends paid by mmc amounted to 681 million in 2004 130 per share and
631 million 118 per share in 2003 at its november 18 meeting mmcs board
deferred its decision with respect to the companys dividend for the first
quarter of 2005 pending completion of its review of marshs business model and
ongoing regulatory matters on february 26 2005 mmc declared a dividend of
017 per share

in june 2004 mmc refinanced 600 million of maturing long term debt by issuing
commercial paper

in july 2004 mmc purchased kroll inc in an allcash transaction totaling
approximately 19 billion the purchase was initially funded with commercial
paper borrowings following the acquisition mmc issued 650 million of 5375
senior notes due 2014 and 500 million of floating rate notes due 2007 the
proceeds from these notes were used to repay the commercial paper borrowings


                                      45
page


in july 2003 mmc issued 300 million of 5875 senior notes due in 2033 in
february 2003 mmc issued 250 million of 3625 senior notes due in 2008 and
250 million of 485 senior notes due in 2013 the 2003 notes the net
proceeds from the 2003 notes were used to pay down commercial paper borrowings

mmc also maintains other credit facilities guarantees and letters of credit
with various banks primarily related to operations located outside the united
states aggregating 331 million at december 31 2004 and 209 million at
december 31 2003 there was 61 million outstanding under these facilities at
december 31 2004

mmcs credit agreements contain covenants which include in some cases
restrictions on consolidations or mergers the sale or pledging of assets and
leverage and coverage ratio requirements details on the specific leverage and
coverage ratio requirements can be found in the credit agreement and amendment
documents filed on form 8k with the sec on december 15 2004 two outstanding
loans amounting to 125 million include covenants stating minimum net worth
requirements the most restrictive of which requires at least 35 billion of
net worth

in january 2003 mmc terminated and settled interest rate swaps that had hedged
the fair value of senior notes issued in 2002 the cumulative amount of
previously recognized adjustments of the fair value of the hedged notes is being
amortized over the remaining life of those notes as a result the effective
interest rate over the remaining life of the notes including the amortization
of the fair value adjustments is 40 for the 500 million senior notes due in
2007 5375 coupon rate and 51 for the 250 million senior notes due in 2012
625 coupon rate

investing cash flows

cash used for investing activities amounted to 26 billion in 2004 and 470
million in 2003 the primary use of cash in 2004 was for the acquisition of
kroll inc synhrgy hr technologies and the australia and new zealand
operations of heath lambert and payments of approximately 61 million for
acquisitions completed in prior years remaining cash payments of approximately
65 million related to acquisitions completed in 2004 and prior years are
recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or in other liabilities in
the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2004 cash used for acquisitions
in 2003 amounted to 178 million primarily related to the acquisition of owc
and several smaller consulting businesses

mmcs additions to fixed assets and capitalized software which amounted to 376
million in 2004 and 436 million in 2003 primarily relate to computer equipment
purchases the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software
development costs

the sale of putnams interest in its italian joint venture and related
securities along with sales of securities by mmc capital generated 199 million
of cash in 2004 securities sales during 2003 generated 106 million these
sales are included in other net in the consolidated statements of cash flows

mmc has committed to potential future investments of approximately 471 million
in connection with various mmc capital private equity funds and other mmc
investments commitments of 276 million relate to trident iii a private equity
fund managed by mmc capital which was formed in 2003 the funding commitment
to trident iii will decrease by 100 million when the spinoff of mmc capitals
business occurs  the remaining commitments relate to other funds


                                      46
page


managed by mmc capital approximately 90 million and by putnam through thl and
thlpc approximately 105 million trident iii closed in december 2003 and has
an investment period of six years while it is unknown when the actual capital
calls will occur typically the investment period for funds of this type has
been closer to four years which would indicate an expected capital call of
approximately 5075 million per year but actual capital calls may occur more
quickly the timing of capital calls is not controlled by mmc the majority of
the other investment commitments for funds managed by mmc capital related to
trident ii the investment period for trident ii is closed for new investments
any remaining capital calls would relate to follow on investments in existing
portfolio companies or for management fees or other partnership expenses
significant capital calls related to trident ii are not expected at this time
although it is anticipated that trident ii will be harvesting its portfolio in
2005 and thereafter the timing of any portfolio company sales and capital
distributions is unknown and not controlled by mmc

putnam has investment commitments of 105 million for three active thl funds of
which approximately 50 million is not expected to be called and funded putnam
is authorized to commit to invest up to 187 million in future thl investment
funds but is not required to do so at december 31 2004 none of the 187
million is committed

approximately 49 million was invested in 2004 related to all of the commitments
discussed above

commitments and obligations

mmcs contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december 31

market risk

certain of mmcs revenues expenses assets and liabilities are exposed to the
impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates and equity markets

interest rate risk

mmc manages its net exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing a mixture of
variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance mmcs asset base interest rate
swaps are used on a limited basis to manage mmcs exposure to interest rate
movements on its cash and investments as well as interest expense on borrowings
and are only executed with counterparties of high creditworthiness

mmc had the following investments and debt instruments subject to variable
interest rates



year ended december 31
in millions of dollars                                    2004
                                   
                                                        
cash and cash equivalents invested
   in certificates of deposit and time deposits note 1   1396
fiduciary cash and investments note 1                    4136
variable rate debt outstanding note 10                   2363


these investments and debt instruments are discussed more fully in the
aboveindicated notes to the consolidated financial statements

based on the above balances if shortterm interest rates increase by 10 or 26
basis points annual interest income would increase by approximately 14
million however this would be partially offset by a 6 million increase in
interest expense resulting in a net increase to income before income taxes and
minority interest of 8 million

foreign currency risk

the translated values of revenue and expense from mmcs international risk and
insurance services and consulting operations are subject to fluctuations due to
changes in currency exchange rates

forward contracts and options are periodically utilized by mmc to limit foreign
currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific
clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of its business

equity price risk

mmc holds investments in both public and private companies as well as certain
private equity funds managed by mmc capital including trident ii and trident
iii publicly traded investments of 410 million are classified as available for
sale under sfas no 115 nonpublicly traded investments of 75 million and 327
million are accounted for under apb opinion no 18 the equity method of
accounting for investments in common stock using the cost method and the
equity method respectively changes in value of trading securities are
recognized in income when they occur the investments that are classified as
available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of
changes in market value which if determined to be other than temporary could
result in realized impairment losses mmc periodically reviews the carrying
value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are
appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements

other

a significant number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending see
note 15 to the consolidated financial statements

managements discussion of critical accounting policies

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make
estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities
revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to
understanding mmcs financial statements because their application places the
most significant demands on managements judgment and estimation about the


                                      48
page


effect of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from
those estimates

legal and other loss contingencies

mmc and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims lawsuits and
proceedings gaap requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when
it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date
and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant management judgment is
required to comply with this guidance mmc analyzes its litigation exposure
based on available information including consultation with outside counsel
handling the defense of these matters to assess its potential liability

retirement benefits

mmc maintains qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for its
us and nonus eligible employees mmcs policy for funding its tax qualified
defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to
meet the funding requirements set forth in us and international laws

the determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of actuarial
assumptions including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the
discount rate and assumed rate of salary increase significant assumptions used
in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are
disclosed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements mmc believes the
assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to
evaluate actuarial assumptions at least annually and adjust as appropriate
pension expense in 2004 increased by 93 million compared with 2003 based on
its current assumptions mmc expects pension expense to increase by
approximately 140 million in 2005 and currently expects to contribute
approximately 256 million to the plans during the year  mmc has reviewed ways
to reduce benefits costs going forward and expects to take actions during 2005
to mitigate these increases by the beginning of 2006

future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions future
investment performance future assumptions and various other factors related to
the populations participating in the pension plans holding all other
assumptions constant a halfpercentage point change in the rate of return and
discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the us
and uk plans which comprise approximately 90 of total pension plan
liabilities as follows



                           05 percentage   05 percentage
                           point increase   point decrease
                              
in millions of dollars   us     uk     us    uk
                                     
                                       
assumed rate of return   130  201   130   201
discount rate            290  472   320   506


changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not
be representative of the impact on expense because the longterm rates of
inflation and salary increases are correlated with the discount rate

mmc contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to
its retired employees the cost of these postretirement benefits for employees
in the united states is accrued during the period up to the date employees are
eligible to retire but is funded by mmc as incurred this postretirement
liability is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets
the key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care

cost trend rate are discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial
statements

income taxes

mmcs tax rate reflects its income statutory tax rates and tax planning in the
various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment is required in
determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating tax positions tax allowances
are established when despite the belief that the tax return positions are fully
supportable there is potential that they may be successfully challenged these
allowances as well as the related interest are adjusted to reflect changing
facts and circumstances

tax law requires items be included in mmcs tax returns at different times than
the items are reflected in the financial statements as a result the annual tax
expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than
that reported in the tax returns some of these differences are permanent such
as expenses that are not deductible in the returns and some differences are
temporary and reverse over time such as depreciation expense temporary
differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets
generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax
returns in future years for which benefit has already been recorded in the
financial statements valuation allowances are established for deferred tax
assets when it is estimated that future taxable income will be insufficient to
use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction deferred tax liabilities
generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which
payment has been deferred or expense for which a deduction has been taken
already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the
financial statements

investment valuation

mmc holds investments in both public and private companies as well as certain
private equity funds managed by mmc capital the majority of these investments
are accounted for as available for sale securities under sfas no 115 where
applicable certain investments are accounted for under apb opinion no 18 mmc
periodically reviews the carrying value of its investments to determine if any
valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting
pronouncements mmc bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they
relate to each investment factors considered in determining the fair value of
private equity investments include implied valuation of recently completed
financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors performance
multiples of comparable public companies restrictions on the sale or disposal
of the investments trading characteristics of the securities and the relative
size of mmcs holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public
market float in those instances where quoted market prices are not available
particularly for equity holdings in private companies or formal restrictions
limit the sale of securities significant management judgment is required to
determine the appropriate value of mmcs investments

companies including entities at lloyds which are considered for client
placements by mmcs insurance and reinsurance brokerage businesses

         compensation for services the revenue attributable to mmcs risk and
insurance services consists primarily of fees paid by clients commissions and
fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies compensation for billing and
related services in the form of interest income on premiums held in a fiduciary
capacity for others market service fees from insurers and compensation for
services provided in connection with the organization structuring and
management of insurance financial services and other industryfocused
investments including fees and dividends as well as appreciation or
depreciation that has been recognized on holdings in such investments

         revenue generated by risk and insurance services is fundamentally
derived from the value of the services provided to clients and insurance
markets these revenues are affected by premium rate levels in the property and
casualty and employee benefits insurance markets and available insurance
capacity since compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by
insureds in many cases compensation may be negotiated in advance based upon
the estimated value of the services to be performed revenue is also affected by
fluctuations in the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients
themselves and by insured values the development of new products markets and
services new and lost business merging of clients including insurance
companies that are clients in the reinsurance intermediary business and the
volume of business from new and existing clients as well as by the level of
interest realized on the investment of fiduciary funds

         revenue and fees also may be received from originating structuring and
managing insurance financial services and other industryfocused investments
as well as income derived from investments made by mmc market services revenue
is derived from agreements that marsh has with most of its principal insurance
markets under these agreements marsh is paid for services provided to the
markets including access to a global distribution network that fosters revenue
generation and operating efficiencies intellectual capital in the form of new
products solutions and general information on emerging developments in the
insurance marketplace the development and provision of technology systems and
services that create efficiencies in doing business and a wide range of
administrative services payments under market service agreements are based upon
such factors as the overall volume growth and in limited cases profitability
of the total business placed by marsh with a given insurer

         commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or
reinsurance coverage provided the particular insurer or reinsurer the capacity
in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients in some cases clients
pay marsh fees for brokerage or advisory

services occasionally commissions are shared with other brokers that have
participated in placing insurance or servicing insureds

billing and related services is governed by the applicable laws or regulations
of insurance authorities of the states in the united states and in other
jurisdictions in which mmcs subsidiaries do business these laws and
regulations typically limit the type of investments that may be made with such
funds the amount of funds invested and interest rates vary from time to time

as well as compliance with pertinent regulations mmc therefore devotes
significant effort toward maintaining its licenses and to ensuring compliance
with a diverse and complex regulatory structure

amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities generally such
authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant renew and
revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations licenses may be
denied or revoked for various reasons including the violation of such
regulations conviction of crimes and similar matters possible sanctions which
may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees limitations on
engaging in a particular business for specified periods of time revocation of
licenses censures redress to clients and fines in some instances mmc follows
practices based on its interpretations or those generally followed by the
industry of laws or regulations which may prove to be different from those of
regulatory authorities accordingly the possibility exists that mmc may be
precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of its
activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction

from a governmental agency or selfregulatory organization in addition certain
of mmcs risk and insurance activities are also governed by investment
securities and futures licensing and other regulatory authorities a few
jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locallyowned
business entities in some of these jurisdictions if mmc has no licensed
subsidiary mmc may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities
licensed to act in such jurisdiction also in some jurisdictions various
insurance related taxes may also be due either by clients directly or from the

an important role in the sale of shares in the putnam funds also sponsor

alternatives they will continue to sell independent funds notwithstanding the
availability of proprietary products however to the extent that these firms
limit or restrict the sale of putnam fund shares through their brokerage systems
in favor of their proprietary mutual funds assets under management might

         on october 28 2003 the massachusetts secretary of the commonwealth
commenced a civil administrative proceeding against putnam and two of its
employees alleging violations of the states securities law antifraud
provisions these violations are alleged to be based on material misstatements
in putnam mutual fund prospectuses because putnam allegedly permitted fund
managers to engage in activities contrary to putnams stated policy against
market timing and shortterm trading putnam is also alleged to have breached
its fiduciary duty to putnam fund shareholders by allowing such employee
conduct in addition the massachusetts action alleges that putnam permitted
certain nonemployee shareholders of putnam funds to engage in excessive market
timing activities in violation of policies allegedly disclosed by putnam in its
mutual fund prospectuses the massachusetts action seeks to have putnam
permanently cease and desist from violating the massachusetts securities law
and to pay restitution to the funds and administrative fines in an undetermined
amount

         additionally putnam has received document subpoenas andor requests
for information from the united states attorney in boston the florida

related to these proceedings which included the estimated potential restitution
to the putnam funds and compliance legal and communication expenses putnams

complaints have been filed in united states district court for the southern
district of new york on behalf of a class of purchasers of mmc stock during the
period from january 2000 to november 2003 the mmc class action complaints
allege among other things that mmc failed to disclose certain market timing
activities at putnam which when disclosed resulted in a drop in the market
price of mmcs shares the mmc class action complaints also name as defendants
certain officers and directors of mmc the mmc class action complaints assert
claims under sections 10b and 20a of the exchange act

         three shareholder derivative actions have been filed against members of
mmcs board of directors and mmc as a nominal defendant in these actions the
plaintiffs purport to state common law claims based on among other things the
boards alleged failure to prevent the alleged market timing from occurring two
of the mmc derivative complaints were filed in the united states district court
for the southern district of new york and one was filed in the supreme court for
the state of new york

         mmc andor putnam have been named in 56 additional actions brought by
investors in putnam funds claiming damages to themselves or the putnam funds as
a result of various market timing activities these actions have been brought
either individually the individual complaints derivatively the putnam
derivative complaints or on behalf of a putative class the putnam class
action complaints the individual complaints the putnam class action
complaints which also name as defendants certain putnam funds and certain
putnam employees and the putnam derivative action complaints which also name
as defendants certain putnam officers and employees and certain trustees of the
putnam funds allege violations of the federal securities and investment
advisory laws and state law at this time seven of these cases are pending in
various state courts putnam has also been named as a defendant in one suit in
its capacity as a subadvisor to a nonputnam fund

         mmc and putnam moved before the judicial panel on multidistrict
litigation the mdl panel to consolidate the federal matters before a single
judge on february 20 2004 the mdl panel issued an order transferring many of
the cases against mmc and putnam along with those against other mutual fund
complexes to the united states district court for the district of maryland for
coordinated pretrial proceedings in most of the federal cases either by
agreement of the parties or order of the court mmc and putnam are not required
to respond until after amended complaints have been filed in the consolidated
actions

         putnam has agreed to indemnify the putnam funds for any liabilities
arising from market timing activities including those that could arise in the
securities litigations and mmc has agreed to guarantee putnams obligations in
that regard

         erisa litigation mmc putnam and various of their officers directors
and employees have been named as defendants in three purported class actions
asserting claims under erisa the erisa actions the erisa actions which
have been brought by participants in mmcs stock investment plan and putnams
profit sharing retirement plan collectively the plans allege among other
things that in view of the market timing trading activity that was allegedly


                                       18
page

allowed to occur at putnam the defendants knew or should have known that the
investment of the plans funds in mmcs stock and putnams mutual fund shares
was imprudent and that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the
plans participants in making these investments the three erisa actions were
filed in federal court for the southern district of new york

         the complaints in the abovereferenced matters seek monetary damages
and other forms of relief at the present time mmcs management is unable to
estimate the impact that the outcome of the foregoing proceedings may have on
mmcs consolidated results of operations or financial position or cash flows

         employment dispute lawrence j lasser former president and ceo of
putnam has initiated an arbitration proceeding against mmc the arbitration
will determine whether and to what extent mr lasser is owed any money under his
employment arrangements with putnam

     other litigation

         mmc and its subsidiaries are subject to various other claims lawsuits
and proceedings consisting principally of alleged errors and omissions in
connection with the placement of insurance or reinsurance and in rendering
investment and consulting services some of these matters seek damages
including punitive damages in amounts that could if assessed be significant
insurance coverage applicable to such matters includes elements of both risk
retention and risk transfer

         although the ultimate outcome of these other matters and the employment
dispute cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be
imposed on mmc and its subsidiaries on the basis of present information it is
the opinion of mmcs management that the disposition or ultimate determination
of these claims lawsuits proceedings or reviews should not have a material
adverse effect on mmcs consolidated financial position or cash flows but may
be material to mmcs operating results in any particular period

which are considered for client placements by mmcs insurance and reinsurance
brokerage businesses

         compensation for services the revenue attributable to mmcs risk and
insurance services consists primarily of fees paid by clients commissions and
fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies compensation for billing and
related services in the form of interest income on funds held in a fiduciary
capacity for others such as premiums and claims proceeds placement service
revenue from insurers and compensation for services provided in connection with
the organization structuring and management of insurance financial services
and other industryfocused investments including fees and dividends as well as
appreciation or depreciation that has been realized on sales of holdings in such
investments

         revenue generated by risk and insurance services is fundamentally
derived from the value of the services provided to clients and insurance
markets these revenues are affected by premium rate levels in the property and
casualty and employee benefits insurance markets and available insurance
capacity since compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by
insureds in many cases compensation may be negotiated in advance based upon
the estimated value of the services to be performed revenue is also affected by
fluctuations in the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients
themselves and by insured values the development of new products markets and
services new and lost business merging of clients including insurance
companies that are clients in the reinsurance intermediary business and the
volume of business from new and existing clients as well as by the level of
interest realized on the investment of fiduciary funds

         revenue and fees also may be received from originating structuring and
managing insurance financial services and other industryfocused investments
as well as income derived from investments made by mmc placement service
revenue includes payments or allowances by insurance companies based upon such
factors as the overall volume of business placed by the broker with that
insurer the aggregate commissions paid by the insurer for that business during
specific periods or the profitability or loss to the insurer of the risks
placed this revenue reflects compensation for services provided by brokers to
the insurance market these services include new product development the
development and provision of technology administration and the delivery of
information on developments among broad client segments and the insurance
markets

         revenues vary from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of
policy renewals the net effect of new and lost business achievement of
contingent compensation thresholds interest and foreign exchange rate
fluctuations and the realization of revenue from investments whereas expenses
tend to be more uniform throughout the year

         commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or
reinsurance coverage provided the particular insurer or reinsurer the capacity
in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients in some cases
compensation for brokerage or advisory services is paid directly as a fee by the
client occasionally commissions are shared with other brokers that have
participated in placing insurance or servicing insureds

certain investors are eligible to purchase shares at net asset value or at
reduced sales charges and investors may generally exchange their shares of a
fund at net asset value for shares of another putnam fund without the payment of

have adopted distribution plans pursuant to rule 12b1 under the investment
company act of 1940 pursuant to which putnam funds are available to investors
with a contingent deferred sales charge under 12b1 plans the putnam funds
make payments to prm to cover costs relating to distribution of the putnam funds
and services provided to shareholders these payments enable prm to pay service
fees and other continuing compensation to firms that provide services to putnam
fund shareholders and distribute shares of the putnam funds some rule 12b1
fees are retained by prm as compensation for the costs of distribution and other
services provided by putnam to shareholders and for commissions advanced by
putnam at the point of sale and recovered through fees received over time to
firms that distribute shares of the putnam funds these 12b1 distribution
plans and payments made by the putnam funds thereunder are subject to annual
renewal by the trustees of the putnam funds and to termination by vote of the
shareholders of the putnam funds or by vote of a majority of the putnam funds
trustees who are not affiliated with putnam failure of the trustees to approve
continuation of the rule 12b1 plans for class b deferred sales charge shares

paid by a fund or to make other changes that would reduce the amount of 12b1
fees received by putnam such changes could have a material adverse effect on

consecutive year after several years of substantial growth prior to 2000
furthermore in 2002 the mutual fund industry had net redemptions in equity
funds for the first time in 14 years the volatility in the equity markets
contributed to the decline in assets under management and accordingly to the
reduction of revenue recognized by putnam a continued decline in general market
levels will reduce future revenue items affecting revenue also include but are
not limited to actual and relative investment performance service to clients
the development and marketing of new investment products the relative
attractiveness of the investment style under prevailing market conditions
changes in the investment patterns of clients and the ability to maintain
investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels

         revenue levels are sensitive to all of the factors above but in
particular to significant changes in bond and stock market valuations
fluctuations in the prices of stocks will have an effect on equity assets under
management and may influence the flow of monies to and from equity funds and
accounts fluctuations in interest rates and in the yield curve have a similar
effect on fixed income assets under management and may influence the flow of
monies to and from fixedincome funds and accounts

an important role in the sale of shares in the putnam funds also sponsor
competing proprietary mutual funds to the extent that such securities dealers
value the ability to offer customers a broad selection of investment
alternatives they will continue to sell independent funds notwithstanding the
availability of proprietary products however to the extent that these firms
limit or restrict the sale of putnam fund shares through their brokerage systems

         the remaining business activities of mmc and its subsidiaries are
conducted principally in leased office space in cities throughout the world in
general no difficulty is anticipated in negotiating renewals as leases expire
or in finding other satisfactory space if the premises become unavailable from
time to time mmc and its subsidiaries may have unused space and may seek to
sublet such space to third parties depending upon the demands for office space
in the locations involved



item 3    legal proceedings

         mmc and its subsidiaries are subject to various claims lawsuits and
proceedings consisting principally of alleged errors and omissions in connection
with the placement of insurance or reinsurance and in rendering investment and
consulting services some of these matters seek damages including punitive
damages in amounts which could if assessed be significant insurance coverage
applicable to such matters includes elements of both risk retention and risk
transfer

         sedgwick group plc since prior to its acquisition has been engaged in
a review of previously undertaken personal pension plan business as required by
united kingdom regulators to determine whether redress should be made to
customers other present and former subsidiaries of mmc are engaged in a
comparable review of their personal pension plan businesses although the extent
of their activity in this area and consequently their financial exposure was
proportionally much less than sedgwick as of december 31 2002 settlements and
related costs previously paid amount to approximately 525 million of which
approximately 200 million is due from or has been paid by insurers a small
percentage of cases remain to be settled at december 31 2002 and the remaining
payments are not expected to be material

be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on mmc
and its subsidiaries on the basis of present information it is the opinion of
mmcs management that the disposition or ultimate determination of these claims
lawsuits or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on mmcs
consolidated results of operations or its consolidated financial position

from the value of the services provided to clients and insurance markets these
revenues may be affected by premium rate levels in the property and casualty and
employee benefits insurance markets and available insurance capacity since
compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds in many
cases compensation may be negotiated in advance based upon the estimated value
of the services to be performed revenue is also affected by fluctuations in the
amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by
insured values the development of new products markets and services new and
lost business merging of clients including insurance companies that are
clients in the reinsurance intermediary business and the volume of

managing investments in insurance financial services and other industryfocused
investments as well as income derived from investments made by mmc contingent
income for services provided includes payments or allowances by insurance
companies based upon such factors as the overall volume of business placed by
the broker with that insurer the aggregate commissions paid by the insurer for
that business during specific periods or the profitability or loss to the
insurer of the risks placed this revenue reflects compensation for services
provided by brokers to the insurance market these services include new product
development the development and provision of technology administration and
the delivery of information on developments among broad client segments and the
insurance markets

       revenues vary from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of policy
renewals the net effect of new and lost business achievement of contingent
compensation thresholds interest and foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the
realization of revenue from investments whereas expenses tend to be more
uniform throughout the year

       commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or
reinsurance coverage provided the particular insurer or reinsurer the capacity
in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients in some cases
compensation for brokerage or advisory services is paid directly as a fee by the
client occasionally commissions are shared with other brokers that have
participated in placing insurance or servicing insureds

       the investment of fiduciary funds which generates compensation for
billing and related services is governed by the applicable laws or regulations
of insurance authorities of the states in the united states and in other
jurisdictions in which mmcs subsidiaries do business these laws and
regulations typically limit the type of investments that may be made with such
funds the amount of funds invested and interest rates vary from time to time

       putnams revenue is derived primarily from investment management and
12b1 fees received from the putnam funds and investment management fees for
institutional accounts investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total
value and composition of assets under management assets under management and
revenue levels are particularly affected by fluctuations in domestic and
international stock and bond market prices the composition of assets under
management and by the level of investments and withdrawals for current and new
fund shareholders and clients us equity markets were volatile throughout 2001
and 2000 and declined in each of those years after several years of substantial
growth prior to 2000 this volatility contributed to the decline in assets under
management and accordingly to the reduction in revenue recognized by putnam a
continued decline in general market levels will reduce future revenue items
affecting revenue also include but are not limited to actual and relative
investment performance service to clients the development and marketing of new
investment products the relative attractiveness of the investment style under
prevailing market conditions changes in the investment patterns of clients and
the ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at
appropriate levels

       revenue levels are sensitive to all of the factors above but in
particular to significant changes in bond and stock market valuations
fluctuations in the prices of stocks will have an effect on equity assets under
management and may influence the flow of monies to and from equity funds and
accounts fluctuations in interest rates and in the yield curve have a similar
effect on fixed income assets under management and may influence the flow of
monies to and from fixedincome funds and accounts putnam provides individual

item 3    legal proceedings

       mmc and its subsidiaries are subject to various claims lawsuits and
proceedings consisting principally of alleged errors and omissions in connection
with the placement of insurance or reinsurance and in rendering investment and
consulting services some of these matters seek damages including punitive
damages in amounts which could if assessed be significant insurance coverage
applicable to such matters includes elements of both risk retention and risk
transfer

       sedgwick group plc since prior to its acquisition has been engaged in a
review of previously undertaken personal pension plan business as required by
united kingdom regulators to determine whether redress should be made to
customers other present and former subsidiaries of mmc are engaged in a
comparable review of their personal pension plan businesses although the extent
of their activity in this area and consequently their financial exposure was
proportionally much less than sedgwick as of december 31 2001 settlements and
related costs previously paid amount to approximately 465 million of which
approximately 140 million is due from or has been paid by insurers the
remaining contingent exposure for pension redress and related costs is estimated
to be 160 million essentially all of which is expected to be recovered from
insurers

       mmcs ultimate exposure from the united kingdom personal investment
authority review as presently calculated and including sedgwick is subject to
a number of variable factors including among others the interest rate
established quarterly by the uk personal investment authority for calculating
compensation equity markets and the precise scope duration and methodology
of the review as required by that authority

       putnam investment management llc and putnam retail management limited
partnership two indirect subsidiaries of mmc as well as entities from
approximately two dozen other mutual fund companies were named as defendants in
an action entitled richard nelson et al v aim advisors inc et al civ
a no 01cv282 in the united states district court for the southern district
of illinois this purported nationwide class action allege that the distribution
and advisor fees paid by the various mutual funds from may 1 1991 to the
present were unlawful and excessive that each fund complex exercised a
controlling influence over statutorily independent directors of each fund and
that these fees were thus not properly approved the complaint alleged that the
defendants actions violated the investment company act of 1940 as well as
common law fiduciary duties and sought among other things actual and punitive
damages and declaratory relief the court responding to motions by putnam and
the other defendants has ordered that the respective claims asserted against
the defendants be severed into separate actions and transferred to a more
convenient forum for each defendant in putnams case this transfer will be to
the united states district court for the district of massachusetts mmc and the
putnam subsidiaries believe that this action is without merit and intend to
defend vigorously against this litigation

       although the ultimate outcome of all matters referred to above cannot be
ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on mmc and
its subsidiaries on the basis of present information it is the opinion of
mmcs management that the disposition or ultimate determination of these claims
lawsuits and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on mmcs
consolidated results of operations or its consolidated financial position

    compensation for services  the revenue attributable to mmcs risk and
insurance services consists primarily of fees paid by clients commissions and
fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies interest income on funds held
in a fiduciary capacity for others such as premiums and claims proceeds
contingent income for services provided to insurers and compensation for
services provided in connection with the organization structuring and
management of insurance financial services and other industryfocused
investments including fees and dividends as well as appreciation that has been
realized on sales of holdings in such entities

    revenue generated by risk and insurance services is fundamentally derived
from the value of the service provided to clients and insurance markets these
revenues may be affected by premium rate levels in the property and casualty and
employee benefits insurance markets and available insurance capacity since
compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds in many
cases compensation may be negotiated in advance based upon the estimated value
of the services to be performed revenue is also affected by fluctuations in the
amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by
insured values the development of new products markets and services new and
lost business merging of clients including insurance companies that are
clients in the reinsurance intermediary business and the volume of business
from new and existing clients as well as by interest rates for fiduciary funds

    revenue and fees also may be received from originating structuring and
managing investments in insurance financial services and other industryfocused
investments as well as income derived from investments made by mmc contingent
income for services provided includes payments or allowances by

                                       4

insurance companies based upon such factors as the overall volume of business
placed by the broker with that insurer the aggregate commissions paid by the
insurer for that business during specific periods or the profitability or loss
to the insurer of the risks placed this revenue reflects compensation for
services provided by brokers to the insurance market these services include new
product development the development and provision of technology
administration and the delivery of information on developments among broad
client segments and the insurance markets

    revenues vary from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of policy
renewals the net effect of new and lost business interest and foreign exchange
rate fluctuations and the realization of investments whereas expenses tend to
be more uniform throughout the year

    commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or
reinsurance coverage provided the particular insurer or reinsurer the capacity
in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients in some cases
compensation for brokerage or advisory services is paid directly as a fee by the
client occasionally commissions are shared with other brokers that have
participated in placing insurance or servicing insureds

    the investment of fiduciary funds is governed by the applicable laws or
regulations of insurance authorities of the states in the united states and in
other jurisdictions in which mmcs subsidiaries do business these laws and
regulations typically limit the type of investments that may be made with such
funds the general amount of funds invested and interest rates vary from time to
time

    putnams revenue is derived primarily from investment management and 12b1
fees received from the putnam funds and institutional accounts assets under
management and revenue levels are particularly affected by fluctuations in
domestic and international stock and bond market prices and by the level of
investments and withdrawals for current and new fund shareholders and clients
us equity markets were volatile throughout 2000 and declined for the year
after several years of substantial growth this volatility contributed to the
fluctuations in assets under management and accordingly to growth rates of
revenue a continued decline in general market levels will reduce revenue growth
or in some circumstances could lead to a decline in revenue items affecting
revenue also include but are not limited to investment performance service to
clients the development and marketing of new investment products the relative
attractiveness of the investment style under prevailing market conditions
changes in the investment patterns of clients and equity earnings associated
with thl investments

    revenue levels are sensitive to all of the factors above but in particular
to significant changes in bond and stock market valuations fluctuations in the
prices of stocks will have an effect on equity assets under management and may
influence the flow of monies to and from equity funds and accounts fluctuations
in interest rates and in the yield curve have a similar effect on fixed income
assets under management and may influence the flow of monies to and from
fixedincome funds and accounts putnam provides individual and institutional

of the advice and services provided to clients it is affected by changes in

foreign exchange rate fluctuations

    regulation  the activities of mmc are subject to licensing requirements and
extensive regulation under the laws of the united states and its various states
territories and possessions as well as laws of other countries in which mmcs
subsidiaries operate these laws and regulations are primarily intended to
benefit clients

    mmcs three business segments depend on the validity of and continued good
standing under the licenses and approvals pursuant to which they operate as
well as compliance with pertinent regulations mmc therefore devotes significant
effort toward maintaining its licenses and to ensuring compliance with a diverse
and complex regulatory structure

    in all jurisdictions the applicable laws and regulations are subject to
amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities generally such
authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant renew and
revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations licenses may be
denied or revoked for various reasons including the violation of such
regulations conviction of crimes and the like possible sanctions which may be
imposed include the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging
in a particular business for specified periods of time revocation of licenses
censures redress to clients and fines in some instances mmc follows practices
based on its interpretations or those generally followed by the industry of
laws or regulations which may prove to be different from those of regulatory

                                       8

authorities accordingly the possibility exists that mmc may be precluded or
temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of its activities or
otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction

    no assurances can be given that mmcs risk and insurance services
investment management or consulting activities can continue to be conducted in
any given jurisdiction as they have been in the past

    risk and insurance services  while the laws and regulations vary among
jurisdictions every state of the united states and most foreign jurisdictions
require an insurance broker or agent and in some cases a reinsurance broker or
intermediary or insurance consultant managing general agent or third party
administrator to have an individual andor company license from a governmental
agency or selfregulatory organization in addition certain of mmcs risk and
insurance activities are governed by the rules of the general insurance
standards council in london and selfregulatory organizations in the united
kingdom and in other jurisdictions as well as investment securities and
futures licensing and regulatory authorities a few jurisdictions issue licenses
only to individual residents or locallyowned business entities in some of
these jurisdictions if mmc has no licensed subsidiary mmc may maintain
arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such
jurisdiction also in some jurisdictions various insurance related taxes may
also be due either by clients directly or from the broker in the latter case
the broker customarily looks to the client for payment

    investment management  putnams securities investment management activities
are subject to regulation in the united states by the securities and exchange
commission and other federal state and self regulatory authorities as well as
in certain other countries in which it does business putnams officers
directors and employees may from time to time own securities which are also held
by the putnam funds or institutional accounts putnams internal policies with
respect to individual investments require prior clearance and reporting of
transactions and restrict certain transactions so as to reduce the possibility
of conflicts of interest

    to the extent that existing or future regulations affecting the sale of
putnam fund shares or other investment products or their investment strategies
cause or contribute to reduced sales of putnam fund shares or investment
products or impair the investment performance of the putnam funds or such other
investment products putnams aggregate assets under management and its revenues
might be adversely affected changes in regulations affecting the free movement
of international currencies might also adversely affect putnam

    consulting  in general the consulting activities of mmcs subsidiaries are
not subject to licensing or other regulatory requirements however the subject
matter of certain consulting services is subject to regulation for example
employee benefit plans are subject to various governmental regulations and
services related to brokerage activities trustee services investment matters
including advice to individuals on the investment of personal pension assets
and the placing of individual and group insurance contracts subject mmcs
subsidiaries to insurance investment or securities regulations and licensing in
various jurisdictions

    competitive conditions  principal methods of competition in risk and
insurance services and consulting include the quality and types of services and
products that a broker or consultant provides its clients and their cost putnam
competes with other providers of investment products and services primarily on
the basis of the range of investment products offered the investment
performance of such products as well as the manner in which such products are
distributed and the scope and quality of the shareholder and other services
provided sales of putnam fund shares are also influenced by general securities
market conditions government regulations global economic conditions and
advertising and sales promotional efforts

    all these businesses also encounter strong competition from both public
corporations and private firms in attracting and retaining qualified employees

    risk and insurance services  the combined insurance and reinsurance broking
services business of mmc is the largest of its type in the world

    mmc encounters strong competition in the risk and insurance services
business from other insurance brokerage firms which also operate on a nationwide
or worldwide basis from a large number of regional and local firms in the
united states the european union and in other countries and regions from
insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance
products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses
including commercial and investment banks accounting firms and consultants that
provide riskrelated services and products

    certain insureds and groups of insureds have established programs of self
insurance including captive insurance companies as a supplement or
alternative to thirdparty insurance thereby reducing in some cases the need
for insurance placements there are also many other providers of insurance
program management services including many insurance companies and many other
organizations seeking to structure and manage investments in the insurance
industry

    investment management  putnam investments is one of the largest investment
management firms in the united states the investment management business is
highly competitive in addition to competition from firms already in the
investment management business including commercial banks stock brokerage and
investment banking firms and insurance companies there is competition from
other firms offering financial services and other investment alternatives
although putnam investments has expanded its marketing and distribution outside
the us it competes in nonus markets with local and global firms many of
whom have much larger investment management businesses in their respective
nonus markets

    many securities dealers whose large retail distribution systems play an
important role in the sale of shares in the putnam funds also sponsor competing
proprietary mutual funds to the extent that such securities dealers value the
ability to offer customers a broad selection of investment alternatives they
will continue to sell independent funds notwithstanding the availability of
proprietary products however to the extent that these firms limit or restrict
the sale of putnam fund shares through their brokerage systems in favor of their
proprietary mutual funds assets under management might decline and putnams
revenues might be adversely affected in addition a number of mutual fund
sponsors presently market their funds to the general public without sales
charges certain firms also offer passively managed funds such as index funds to
the general public

item 2  properties

    mmc and certain of its subsidiaries as tenants in common own a 69
condominium interest in a 44story building in new york city which serves as
their worldwide headquarters

    the principal offices of mmcs risk and insurance services subsidiaries in
the uk are located on the eastern side of the city of london in the marsh
centre this freehold building owned by a subsidiary of mmc comprises 360000
square feet containing offices located around a central atrium and ancillary
facilities including a shopping mall

    the remaining business activities of mmc and its subsidiaries are conducted
principally in leased office space in cities throughout the world in general
no difficulty is anticipated in negotiating renewals as leases expire or in
finding other satisfactory space if the premises become unavailable from time
to time

                                       11

mmc may have unused space and may seek to sublet such space to third parties
depending upon the demands for office space in the locations involved



item 3  legal proceedings

    mmc and its subsidiaries are subject to various claims lawsuits and
proceedings consisting principally of alleged errors and omissions in connection
with the placement of insurance or reinsurance and in rendering investment and
consulting services some of these matters seek damages including punitive
damages in amounts which could if assessed be significant

    sedgwick group plc since prior to its acquisition has been engaged in a
review of previously undertaken personal pension plan business as required by
united kingdom regulators to determine whether redress should be made to
customers as of december 31 2000 settlements and related costs previously
paid amount to approximately 200 million of which approximately 30 million is
due from or has been paid by insurers the contingent exposure of sedgwick for
pension redress and related costs is estimated to be 240 million sedgwick has
recorded 100 million of reserves and recognized approximately 140 million of
insurance recoveries related to this exposure

    other present and former subsidiaries of mmc are engaged in a comparable
review of their personal pension plan businesses although the extent of their
activity in this area and consequently their financial exposure was
proportionally much less than sedgwick the contingent exposure of the present
and former nonsedgwick subsidiaries of mmc for pension redress and related
costs is estimated to be approximately 110 million essentially all of which is
expected to be recovered from insurers as of december 31 2000 net settlements
and related costs previously paid total approximately 55 million

    mmcs ultimate exposure from the united kingdom personal investment
authority review as presently calculated and including sedgwick is subject to
a number of variable factors including among others the interest rates
established quarterly by the uk personal investment authority for calculating
compensation equity markets and the precise scope duration and methodology
of the review as required by that authority

    on the basis of present information anticipated insurance coverage and
advice received from counsel it is the opinion of mmcs management that the
disposition or ultimate determination of these claims lawsuits and proceedings
will not have a material adverse effect on mmcs consolidated results of
operations or its consolidated financial position
