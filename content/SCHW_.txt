in october 2020 the federal reserve occ and fdic jointly adopted a final net stable funding ratio nsfr rule to strengthen the resilience of large bank and savings and loan holding companies by requiring them to maintain a minimum level of stable funding based on the liquidity characteristics of the holding company’s assets commitments and derivative exposures over a oneyear time horizon the requirement is expressed as a ratio of a banking entity’s available stable funding asf to its required stable funding rsf category iii banking organizations with less than 75 billion in average weighted shortterm wholesale funding and their depository institution subsidiaries with 10 billion or more in total consolidated assets are required to maintain asf in an amount at least equal to 85 of its rsf on an ongoing daily basis the final nsfr rule became effective on july 1 2021 and banking entities subject to the rule will be required to publicly disclose their quarterly nsfrs on a semiannual basis beginning with the first and second quarters of 2023 as a result of our average weighted shortterm wholesale funding exceeding the 75 billion threshold we became subject to daily reporting of the nsfr to the federal reserve on july 1 2021 and became subject to the full 100 nsfr on october 1 2021

in its enhanced prudential standards rules the federal reserve also made category iii savings and loan holding companies subject to an annual supervisory stress testing requirement in which the federal reserve conducts its own stress testing analysis to evaluate the ability of a holding company to absorb losses in specified economic and financial conditions over a ninequarter planning horizon using such analytical techniques as the agency determines are appropriate this supervisory stress testing requirement will go into effect for csc beginning with the 2022 stress testing cycle to implement this requirement the federal reserve also expanded the reporting requirements applicable to savings and loan holding companies commencing in the second quarter of 2020

deposit insurance assessments 

the fdic’s deposit insurance fund dif provides insurance coverage for certain deposits generally up to 250000 per depositor per account ownership type and is funded by quarterly assessments on insured depository institutions the fdic uses a riskbased deposit premium assessment system that for large insured depository institutions with at least 10 billion in total consolidated assets uses a scorecard method based on a number of factors including the institution’s regulatory ratings asset quality and brokered deposits the deposit insurance assessment base is calculated as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity 

brokered deposits 

in december 2020 the fdic adopted amendments to its brokered deposits rule to establish a new framework for determining whether deposits made through arrangements between third parties and depository institutions constitute brokered deposits and more specifically to clarify the circumstances under which brokerdealers that place deposits with depository institutions through brokerage sweep arrangements such as csco and tdac qualify for the “primary purpose exception” from the definition of a deposit broker under the new framework the fdic established a new “25 percent” business relationship designated exception where a brokerdealer or other third party may qualify for the primary purpose exception by filing a notice with the fdic indicating that less than 25 percent of its customer assets under administration for a particular business line are placed at depository institutions the fdic’s brokered deposit rule amendments became effective on april 1 2021 under the new framework funds swept by our brokerdealer subsidiaries to csb and schwab’s other depository institution subsidiaries continue to qualify for the primary purpose exception

 item 1a risk factors 

we face a variety of risks that may affect our operations financial results or stock price and many of those risks are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict the following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant although there may be other risks that could arise or may prove to be more significant than expected that may affect our operations or financial results 

for a discussion of our risk management governance and processes including operational risk compliance risk credit risk market risk and liquidity risk see risk management and capital management in part ii item 7 

economic and market risks 

the challenging economic environment triggered by the coronavirus covid19 pandemic has impacted and will continue to impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

the onset of the covid‑19 pandemic adversely impacted the economic environment and credit markets leading to lower interest rates across the curve heightened volatility in the financial markets and marketdriven credit spread movements in certain sectors within our portfolio of investment securities although certain economic conditions improved in 2021 the pandemic continues to evolve and certain impacts of the pandemic including shortterm interest rates may continue to have a negative impact on our net interest revenue bank deposit account fee revenue and asset management and administration fees additionally in march 2020 we experienced a significant increase in client cash balances held at our bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries which caused our tier 1 leverage ratio to decline into the buffer we maintain between our longterm operating objective and our regulatory requirement we will continue to have limits on our ability to return excess capital to stockholders including through share repurchases until the ratio returns to higher levels 

the pandemic has also impacted our client service quality at times certain of our client service response and processing times increased as a result of very high levels of client engagement and our clients experienced and may continue to occasionally experience delays accessing and using our website and mobile applications while we have focused on hiring additional client service employees we like many employers continue to face challenges retaining and hiring employees in addition we recently experienced and may again experience staffing shortages at our call centers and branches due to the rapid spread of new variants of covid19 many of our employees and those of our outsourced service providers are working remotely and this has at times contributed to the increase in response and processing times particularly when we have experienced the temporary loss of services from some of our outsourced service providers we consider service quality to be an important part of the client experience and our failure to meet client expectations could result in decreased client satisfaction 

these and other impacts of the covid‑19 pandemic have had and will likely continue to have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described elsewhere in this “risk factors” section the extent to which the covid‑19 pandemic or the emergence of another widespread health crisis impacts our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain including the scope and duration of the outbreak actions taken by governmental authorities to contain the financial and economic impact and the spread of the outbreak the effect on our clients employees and outsourced service providers changes in credit quality and spreads and reactions in the financial markets 

developments in the business economic and geopolitical environment could negatively impact our business 

our business can be adversely affected by the general environment – economic corporate securities market regulatory and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations trading activity interest rates and overall investor engagement and are outside of our control deterioration in the housing and credit markets reduction in interest rates and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact our results of operations and capital resources

the charles schwab corporation 

the monetary policies of the federal reserve which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states have a significant effect on our operating results actions taken by the federal reserve including changes in its target funds rate and balance sheet management are difficu lt to predict and can affect our net interest revenue and bank deposit account fees these policies could also have implications for clients’ allocation to cash higher or lower client cash balances have an impact on our capital requirements as well as liquidity implications if such changes in allocation are sudden  

a significant change in client cash allocations could negatively impact our income 

we rely heavily on client cash balances to generate revenue cash awaiting investment in a portion of our client brokerage accounts is swept to our banking subsidiaries and those bank deposits are then used to extend loans to clients and purchase investment securities we also sweep a portion of such cash to unconsolidated thirdparty financial institutions pursuant to the ida agreement and agreements with other thirdparty financial institutions through which we earn bank deposit account fees a significant reduction in our clients’ allocation to cash a change in the allocation of that cash or a transfer of cash away from the company could reduce our income 

significant interest rate changes could affect our profitability 

the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings a decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on our net interest revenue and our bank deposit account fee revenue a low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact on our asset management and administration fee revenues when we have to waive a portion of our management fees for certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds in order to continue providing a positive return to clients the significant reduction in interest rates related to the covid19 pandemic has had and will continue to have a negative impact on our revenue related to interest rates and has caused us to waive management fees for certain funds 

although we believe we are positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment a rise in interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase if market conditions or the competitive environment induces us to raise our interest rates to avoid losing deposits or replace deposits with higher cost funding sources without offsetting increases in yields on interestearning assets can reduce our net interest revenue 

the announced phaseout of the london interbank offered rate libor could negatively impact our net interest revenue and will continue to require operational work 

certain securities in our investment portfolio the floating rate loans we offered and certain series of our outstanding preferred stock reference libor as the benchmark rate to determine the applicable interest rate payment amount or floating dividend rates while we have substantially transitioned our financial models and systems away from libor in limited circumstances we still use libor when libor is discontinued as announced there will be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments this could result in different financial performance for previously booked transactions the calculation of interest rates under the replacement benchmarks could also impact our net interest revenue libor may also perform differently during the phaseout period than in the past which could result in lower interest payments and a reduction in the value of certain securities in our investment portfolio in addition further operational work will be required to transition our legacy loan portfolio to alternate reference rates that are consistent with the fallback language included in the contracts see also part ii – item 7 – risk management for additional information regarding the company’s consideration of the phaseout of libor 

compliance risks 

extensive regulation of our businesses may subject us to significant penalties or limitations on business activities 

as a participant in the securities banking and financial services industries we are subject to extensive regulation under federal state and foreign laws by governmental agencies supervisory authorities and sros the costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase these regulations affect our business operations and impose capital client prote ction and market conduct requirements on us as well as restrictions on the activities that we are allowed to conduct we become subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny as we grow 

regulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies and could prevent us from pursuing our business strategy regulators could also limit our ability to grow including adding assets launching new products making acquisitions and undertaking strategic investments our banking regulators could require csc andor our banking subsidiaries to hold more capital increase liquidity or limit their ability to pay dividends or csc’s ability to repurchase or redeem shares despite our efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements there are a 

 14  

the charles schwab corporation 

number of risks particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by our regulators against us or our affiliates officers or employees could result in fines penalties cease and desist orders enforcement actions suspension disqualification or expulsion or other disciplinary sanctions including limitations on our business activities any of which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

while we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations violations could occur in addition some legalregulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time there may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance including restrictions on certain activities such a finding may also damage our reputation and our relationships with our regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities 

legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect our business and financial results 

new legislation rules regulations and guidance or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal state foreign and sro rules regulations and guidance including changes relating to mutual funds standards of conduct with clients conflicts of interest regulatory treatment of deposit accounts and order routing practices and orderrelated revenues may directly affect our operations and profitability or our specific business lines our profitability could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally including changes to the laws governing taxation electronic commerce client privacy and security of client data in addition the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct modifications to our business practices more stringent capital and liquidity requirements increased deposit insurance assessments or additional costs and could limit our ability to return capital to stockholders these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance risk management treasury and operations functions 

failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect our financial condition 

csc together with its banking brokerdealer and fcmfdm subsidiaries must meet certain capital and liquidity standards subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of our capital and our internal assessment of our capital needs the uniform net capital rule limits the ability of our brokerdealer entities to transfer capital to csc and other affiliates new regulatory capital liquidity capital planning and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital including paying dividends stock repurchases and redemptions and may require us to increase our capital andor liquidity or to limit our growth failure by either csc or its banking subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have a negative impact on us in addition failure by csc or our banking subsidiaries to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy their capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer requirements would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as tier 1 capital or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could require us to liquidate assets deleverage or otherwise change our business andor investment plans which may adversely affect our financial results issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders 

in january 2021 the federal reserve adopted a final rule effective with the 2022 ccar cycle making large savings and loan holding companies including csc subject to the ccar process which requires submission of an annual capital plan the plan must include a description of all planned capital actions including dividends or stock repurchases over a ninequarter planning horizon beginning with the first quarter of the calendar year the capital plan is submitted the rule also imposes a stress capital buffer requirement floored at 25 percent of riskweighted assets that will replace csc’s current 25 percent capital conservation buffer for our riskbased capital ratios the stress capital buffer will equal as a percentage of total riskweighted assets the sum of i the difference between a firm’s starting common equity tier 1 capital ratio and the low point under the severely adverse scenario of the federal reserve’s supervisory stress test plus ii the ratio of the firm’s projected four quarters of common stock dividends for the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon to riskweighted assets as projected under ccar the imposition of a stress capital buffer requirement could change the way in which our minimum riskbased capital ratios are calculated and make us subject to progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions if we approach our minimum ratios this could lead to restrictions on our ability to pay or increase dividends or otherwise return capital to stockholders

the charles schwab corporation 

if the average of csc’s total consolidated assets for four consecutive calendar quarters reaches 700 billion or if the average of crossjurisdictional activity for four consecutive calendar quarters reaches 75 billion csc will become subject to more stringent category ii requirements including annual stress testing the advanced approaches framework and the inability to opt out of including aoci in regulatory capital calculations at december 31 2021 csc had approximately 670 billion in total assets and crossjurisdictional activity of approximately 32 billion 

we are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending against claims or proceedings 

the financial services industry faces significant litigation and regulatory risks we are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business including arbitrations class actions and other litigation some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages we are also the subject of inquiries investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies 

litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by our clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied with us claims from clients of third party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors’ misconduct litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights eg patents such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources if we were found to have infringed on a thirdparty patent or other intellectual property rights we could incur substantial damages and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology or providing certain products or services 

actions brought against us may result in settlements awards injunctions fines penalties or other results adverse to us including reputational harm even if we are successful in defending against these actions the defense of such matters may result in us incurring significant expenses a substantial judgment settlement fine or penalty could be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular future period depending on our results for that period in market downturns and periods of heightened volatility the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased 

operational risk 

security breaches of our systems or those of our clients or third parties may subject us to significant liability and damage our reputation 

our business involves the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential information about our clients and us information security risks for financial institutions are increasing in part because of the use of the internet and mobile and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime activists hackers and other external parties including foreign state actors our systems and those of other financial institutions have been and will continue to be the target of cyber attacks malicious code computer viruses ransomware and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access misuse loss or destruction of data including confidential client information account takeovers unavailability of service or other events despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means for example employee misconduct 

given the high volume of transactions that we process the large number of clients counterparties and thirdparty service providers with which we do business including cloud service providers and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected the extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before an investigation is completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known during such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack 

security breaches including breaches of our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers or clients could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject us to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance actions by our regulators damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in our security measures 

 16  

the charles schwab corporation 

which could harm our business we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures 

we also face risk related to external fraud involving the misappropriation and use of clients’ user names passwords or other personal information to gain access to our clients’ financial accounts this could occur from the compromise of clients’ personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company where clients’ personal information is taken and then made available to fraudsters such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties including foreign statesponsored parties losses reimbursed to clients under our guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

technology and operational failures or errors could subject us to losses litigation regulatory actions and reputational damage 

we must process record and monitor a large number of transactions and our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to our systems system interruptions errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes including changes in client use patterns technological failure changes to our systems linkages with thirdparty systems and power failures and can have a significant impact on our business and operations our systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error execution errors errors in models such as those used for asset management capital planning and management risk management stress testing and compliance employee misconduct unauthorized trading external fraud computer viruses distributed denial of service attacks cyber attacks terrorist attacks natural disaster extreme weather power outage capacity constraints software flaws events impacting key business partners and vendors and similar events for example we and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have in certain circumstances made websites mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time cloud technologies are critical to the operation of our systems and platforms and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing cloud service disruptions may lead to delays in accessing data that is important to our businesses and may hinder our clients’ access to our platforms it could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to our technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence which could affect our ability to process and settle client transactions moreover instances of fraud or other misconduct might also negatively impact our reputation and client confidence in the company in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances the ways that fraudulent activity is attempted is continuously evolving and while we monitor for new types of fraud there may be a delay in recognizing the fraud is happening besides potential losses shutting down the fraudulent activity often requires a balance with client experience despite our efforts to identify areas of risk oversee operational areas involving risk and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks there can be no assurance that we will not suffer unexpected losses reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors including those of our vendors or other third parties 

while we devote substantial attention and resources to the reliability capacity and scalability of our systems extraordinary trading volumes such as those that occurred in 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 could cause our computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail affecting our ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients’ orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate for example certain of our client service response and processing times increased in 2020 as a result of very high levels of client engagement and our clients experienced delays accessing our systems during periods when there was an unusually high volume of client activity disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses decreased client satisfaction reputational damage and regulatory inquiries we are also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges clearing houses market makers dealers and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement system failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices and cancelled orders cause substantial losses for us and for our clients and subject us to claims from our clients for damages and cause reputational harm 

  

our investment management operations may subject us to fiduciary or other legal liability for client losses 

fund and trust management and administration are complex activities and include functions such as recordkeeping and accounting security pricing corporate actions compliance with investment restrictions daily net asset value computations account reconciliations and required distributions to fund shareholders failure to properly perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of our services and products could subject us to regulatory sanctions penalties or litigation and result in reputational damage liability to clients and the termination of investment management or administration agreements and the withdrawal of assets under our management 

 17  

the charles schwab corporation 

in the management and administration of funds and client accounts we use quantitative models and other tools and resources to support investment decisions and processes including those related to risk assessment portfolio management trading and hedging activities and product valuations errors in the design function or underlying assumptions used in these models and tools particularly if we fail to detect the errors over an extended period could subject us to claims of a breach of fiduciary duty and potentially large liabilities for makewhole payments litigation andor regulatory fines 

we rely on outsourced service providers to perform key functions 

we rely on external service providers to perform certain key technology cloud infrastructure processing servicing and support functions these service providers face technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information could cause us to incur losses and could harm our reputation an interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints financial difficulties natural disasters extreme weather power outage public health crises political developments or for any other reason and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in financial losses to us as a result of certain stay at home restrictions related to the covid19 pandemic we temporarily lost the services from some of our outsourced service providers which contributed to increased client service response and processing times switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations 

we rely on financial intermediaries to execute and settle client orders 

we rely on market makers dealers securities exchanges clearing houses and other financial intermediaries to execute and settle our clients’ orders the unwillingness or inability of any of these parties to perform their usual functions coupled with the unavailability of alternative arrangements could result in our clients’ orders not getting executed or settled this may be due to market volatility uneconomic trading conditions capacity constraints financial constraints system failures unanticipated trading halts invoked by securities exchanges market closures or other reasons our inability to get client orders executed or settled because of the unwillingness or inability of these parties to perform their usual functions could result in client dissatisfaction and reputational harm and expose us to client claims for damages 

liquidity risk 

a significant decrease in our liquidity could negatively affect our business as well as reduce client confidence in us 

maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our business operations including transaction settlement custody requirements and lending commitments among other liquidity needs we meet our liquidity needs primarily from working capital and cash generated by client activity as well as external financing fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances as well as market conditions or changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits may affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs a reduction in our liquidity position could reduce client confidence in us which could result in the transfer of client assets and accounts or could cause us to fail to satisfy our liquidity requirements including the lcr in addition if our brokerdealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to csc which could reduce csc’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt pay dividends on csc’s preferred stock or return capital to common stockholders in addition csc may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries 

factors which may adversely affect our liquidity position include csco and tdac having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances fluctuations in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts a dramatic increase in our lending activities including margin mortgagerelated and personal lending increased capital requirements changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations other regulatory changes or a loss of market or client confidence in us resulting in unanticipated withdrawals of client funds as a member firm of securities and derivatives clearing houses we are required to deposit cash stock andor government securities for margin requirements and to clearing funds the margin requirements may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon the nature and size of clients’ trading activity and market volatility for example as a result of recent market volatility the national securities clearing corporation increased margin requirements for member firms and we were required to deposit additional funds clearing houses could also require additional funds from member firms if a clearing member defaults on its obligations to the clearing house in an amount larger than its own margin and clearing fund deposits 

 18  

the charles schwab corporation 

when available cash is not sufficient for our liquidity needs we may seek external financing during periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets potential sources of external financing could be reduced and borrowing costs could increase although csc csco and tdac maintain uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines and csc has a commercial paper issuance program as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec which can be used to sell securities financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets in addition a significant downgrade in the company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets 

credit risk 

we may suffer significant losses from our credit exposures 

our businesses are subject to the risk that a client counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate while we have policies and procedures designed to manage this risk the policies and procedures may not be fully effective our exposure mainly results from margin lending clients’ options and futures trading securities lending mortgage lending pledged asset lending our role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds we sponsor 

when clients purchase securities on margin borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities or trade options or futures we are subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients’ indebtedness abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses especially if there is a lack of liquidity as a result of our td ameritrade acquisition our margin options and futures business has materially increased and market liquidity may represent an increased risk 

we have exposure to credit risk associated with our investments those investments are subject to price fluctuations loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such loss of value has resulted from a credit loss the evaluation of whether a credit loss exists is a matter of judgment which includes the assessment of multiple factors if management determines that a security’s decline in fair value is the result of a credit loss an allowance for credit losses on the security will be recorded and a corresponding loss will be recognized in current earnings even if a decline in fair value of a security is not determined to have resulted from a credit loss if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs we would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time 

our bank loans primarily consist of first mortgages helocs and pals increases in delinquency and default rates housing and stock price declines increases in the unemployment rate and other economic factors including from the continuing impact of the covid19 pandemic can result in increases in allowances for credit losses and related credit loss expense as well as write downs on such loans 

heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments can increase our risk of loss examples include 

• large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry 

• mortgage loans and helocs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region and 

• client margins options or futures pledged assets and securities lending activities collateralized by or linked to securities of a single issuer index or industry 

we sponsor a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds although we have no obligation to do so we may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit liquidity or other support to our funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity such support could cause us to take significant charges could reduce our liquidity and in certain situations could with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds result in us having to consolidate one or more funds in our financial statements if we choose not to provide credit liquidity or other support in such a situation we could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected

risks related to our td ameritrade acquisition 

we may fail to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the td ameritrade acquisition which could adversely affect the value of our stock 

the success of our td ameritrade acquisition will continue to depend in significant part on our ability to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from integrating the businesses of schwab and td ameritrade which is subject to certain risks if we are not able to successfully combine the businesses of schwab and td ameritrade within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected the combined business may not perform as expected and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected 

it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key schwab or td ameritrade employees the loss of clients the disruption of either company’s or both companies’ ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues higher than expected integration costs and an overall postcompletion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated 

most of the integration planning and execution work is currently being done remotely due to the covid19 pandemic the inability to work inperson and onsite with information technology and management oversight has and will continue to make some of the integration work more challenging particularly with regard to technology we will need to continue to hire a significant number of technology personnel and contract staff and rely on a number of critical technology vendors in order to complete the integration work relating to technology platforms and systems within the target timeframe in addition we may experience delays in acquiring the technology and infrastructure components needed for the integration due to pandemicrelated supply chain disruptions we have to make certain assumptions for integration planning and subsequent changes to integration plans impact the timing and cost of the integration for example as a result of the higher levels of trading volumes that we recently experienced we had to increase capacity from the original technology buildout plan in addition at times the attention of certain members of our management and other resources may be diverted from integration work to critical daytoday business operations we may also encounter challenges integrating td ameritrade technologies into schwab platforms any of these factors could make timely achievement of integration milestones more challenging particularly with regard to technology and systems 

we will continue to incur significant integration costs in connection with the integration of td ameritrade 

we will continue to incur significant nonrecurring costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans with respect to combining the operations of schwab and td ameritrade including technologyrelated workforce and facilities consolidation costs we continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies’ businesses 

we may have difficulty attracting motivating and retaining executives and other employees during the integration of td ameritrade 

uncertainty about the effect of the td ameritrade integration on schwab and td ameritrade employees may impair our ability to attract retain and motivate personnel employee retention may be particularly challenging during the integration process as employees of schwab and td ameritrade may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined business if employees of schwab or td ameritrade depart the integration of the companies may be more difficult and the combined business may be harmed furthermore we may have to incur significant costs in identifying hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to the businesses of schwab or td ameritrade and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may be adversely affected in addition there could be disruptions to or distractions for the workforce and management associated with integrating employees into schwab 

 20  

the charles schwab corporation 

the td ameritrade acquisition may not be accretive to our earnings per share which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

based on the anticipated synergies between schwab and td ameritrade we expect the acquisition to be accretive to our earnings per share in the third year following completion of the merger however future events and conditions could reduce or delay the accretion that is currently projected or result in the acquisition being dilutive to our earnings per share including adverse changes in market conditions additional transaction and integration related costs and other factors such as the failure to realize some or all of the benefits anticipated in the acquisition any dilution of reduction in or delay of any accretion to our earnings per share could cause the price of shares of our common stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate 

other business risks 

potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on our financial position 

we evaluate potential strategic transactions including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions any such transaction could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows the process of evaluating negotiating effecting and integrating any such strategic transaction may divert management’s attention from other business concerns and might cause the loss of key clients employees and business partners moreover integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties including the need to integrate operational financial and management information systems and management controls integrate relationships with clients and business partners and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas the integration process could result in the disruption of ongoing businesses or changes to inconsistent standards controls procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients employees outsourced service providers and vendors in addition an acquisition may cause us to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings or require the amortization of a large amount of acquired intangible assets further we may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition in a timely manner or at all including without limitation the recent acquisition of td ameritrade and any future acquisition could be dilutive to our current stockholders’ percentage ownership or to earnings per common share eps 

our acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business operations or financial condition of the entity or part of an entity being acquired or sold to the extent we enter into an agreement to buy or sell an entity or part of an entity there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected or at all if a material transaction does not close our stock price could decline 

our industry is highly competitive and characterized by aggressive price competition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment with a broad array of competitors from large integrated banks to venturecapital backed private companies we continually monitor our pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjust interest rates on deposits and loans fees for advisory services expense ratios on mutual funds and etfs trade commission rates and other pricing and incentives to sustain our competitive position increased price competition from other financial services firms to attract clients such as reduced commissions higher deposit rates reduced mutual fund or etf expense ratios or the increased use of incentives could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

we face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees 

the market for qualified personnel in our business is highly competitive at various times different functions and roles are in especially high demand in the market compelling us to pay more to attract talent recently the challenge and cost for us to retain and hire talent has increased in september 2021 we implemented a 5 salary increase for almost all of our employees our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs 

we need to continue to hire a significant number of technology personnel and contract staff to complete the td ameritrade integration work within the target timeframe demand for skilled technology professionals is high and we may experience delays in hiring the appropriate skilled resources

our stock price has fluctuated historically and may continue to fluctuate 

our stock price can be volatile among the factors that may affect the volatility of our stock price are the following 

• speculation in the investment community or the press about or actual changes in our competitive position organizational structure executive team operations financial condition financial reporting and results expense discipline strategic transactions progress on achieving the expected benefits from our td ameritrade acquisition or ratings from third parties 

• the announcement of new products services acquisitions or dispositions by us or our competitors 

• increases or decreases in revenue or earnings changes in earnings estimates by the investment community and variations between estimated financial results and actual financial results and 

• sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by large stockholders 

changes in the stock market generally or as it concerns our industry as well as geopolitical corporate regulatory business and economic factors may also affect our stock price 

future sales of csc’s equity securities may adversely affect the market price of csc’s common stock and result in dilution 

csc’s certificate of incorporation authorizes csc’s board of directors among other things to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities without stockholder approval 

csc may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes the issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of csc’s common stock and may adversely affect the market price of csc’s common stock 

our ongoing relationships with td bank and its affiliates could have a negative impact on us 

although our acquisition of td ameritrade was structured such that completion of the merger would not result in csc either i being deemed to be “controlled” by td bank as that term is interpreted by the federal reserve under the bhc act or hola or ii being deemed to be in “control” of any of td bank’s depository institutions changes in circumstances could trigger presumptions of control under the federal reserve’s regulations this could occur if td bank and its affiliates own more than 99 of schwab common stock as interpreted in accordance with the applicable rules of the federal reserve while the stockholder agreement between csc and td bank prohibits td bank and its affiliates from exceeding the 99 threshold it could happen unintentionally this presumption of control could also be triggered if the revenue generated to either us or to any of the td bank depository institutions exceeds a certain percentage the stockholder agreement contains provisions to address such situations 

under the ida agreement we are only permitted to reduce the deposit balances swept to the td depository institutions by a set amount during each 12month period subject to certain limitations and adjustments including only moving ida balances designated as floatingrate obligations and maintaining a minimum 50 billion ida sweep balance through june 2031 the bank deposit account fee revenue that we earn related to the ida agreement may be less than the net interest revenue that we could have earned if the deposit balances were swept to our banking subsidiaries rather than the td depository institutions when we are permitted to reduce the ida balances we can only move the balances to our banking subsidiaries if we have sufficient capital in addition in a low rate environment it is possible that the sweep arrangement fee computation could result in a negative amount that we would be required to pay the td depository institutions resulting in us having an expense rather than revenue

overview 

management focuses on several client activity and financial metrics in evaluating schwab’s financial position and operating performance we believe that metrics relating to net new and total client assets as well as client cash levels and utilization of advisory services offer perspective on our business momentum and client engagement data on new and total client brokerage accounts provides additional perspective on our ability to attract and retain new business total net revenue growth pretax profit margin eps return on average common stockholders’ equity and the consolidated tier 1 leverage ratio provide broad indicators of schwab’s overall financial health operating efficiency and ability to generate acceptable returns total expenses excluding interest as a percentage of average client assets is a measure of operating efficiency

2021 compared to 2020 

schwab delivered strong growth and financial performance in 2021 consistently executing on our “through clients’ eyes” strategy throughout a fluctuating macroeconomic environment early in 2021 we saw strengthened investor optimism fueled by an advancing economic recovery and signs of improvement in the covid19 pandemic as the year progressed debates increased over the pace of economic growth the path of inflation and the ultimate impact of multiple global market disruptions after major equity indices rose throughout the first half of 2021 they were essentially flat during the summer months before ending the year at nearrecord levels while shortterm interest rates remained near zero throughout 2021 longerterm rates began to rise initially then eased and rose again as the 10year treasury yield finally ended 2021 at 152 up 59 basis points from yearend 2020 

investors were actively engaged with the markets throughout 2021 including extraordinary trading volume in the first quarter and client activity throughout the remainder of the year also generally exceeded the fourth quarter of 2020 when we included td ameritrade in our results for the first time asset gathering was strong throughout 2021 as core net new assets totaled 5582 billion representing an 8 annual organic growth rate from yearend 2020 we ended 2021 with 814 trillion in client assets and 332 million brokerage accounts representing increases of 22 and 12 respectively from december 31 2020 even as we worked to support heightened levels of client activity during 2021 the company continued to drive progress across our key strategic priorities of scale and efficiency winwin monetization and segmentation we made significant progress on our integration of td ameritrade and continue to expect to complete client conversion within 30 to 36 months from the october 6 2020 acquisition date 

schwab produced strong financial performance during 2021 reflecting consistent execution of our strategy strong client engagement and a generally supportive macroeconomic backdrop net income totaled 59 billion during 2021 increasing 77 from 2020 while diluted earnings per common share eps amounted to 283 increasing 33 from the prior year adjusted diluted eps 1  which excludes acquisition and integrationrelated costs amortization of acquired intangible assets and related income tax effects amounted to 325 increasing 33 from 2020 our financial results were significantly impacted by the inclusion of td ameritrade for the full year of 2021 

total net revenues increased 58 from 2020 to reach 185 billion in 2021 supported by growth across all of our major revenue streams net interest revenue totaled 80 billion in 2021 increasing 31 from 2020 primarily due to the inclusion of td ameritrade as well as significant growth in interestearning assets including rising investment portfolio balances and increased utilization of our range of lending products partially offset by lower average yields asset management and administration fees grew 23 over the prior year to reach 43 billion due to the inclusion of td ameritrade as well as rising balances in advice solutions and both proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds and etfs partially offset by lower revenue on money market funds 

trading revenue was 42 billion in 2021 nearly three times the prior year total of 14 billion as the fullyear inclusion of td ameritrade and the overall strong trading environment drove a significant increase in dats trading revenue was also helped in 2021 by a higher proportion of derivatives trades which contributed to higher revenue per trade a full year of bank deposit account fees totaled 13 billion in 2021 bda balances totaled 1586 billion at december 31 2021 down 3 from the yearend 2020 balance of 1635 billion reflecting migrations to schwab’s balance sheet during 2021 

total expenses excluding interest were 108 billion in 2021 increasing 46 from 2020 due to the fullyear inclusion of td ameritrade’s results as well as higher compensation and benefits expense which was driven by additional headcount to support our expanding client base and a higher bonus accrual as well as merit increases and a 5 employee salary increase we implemented at the end of the third quarter during 2021 acquisition and integrationrelated costs were 468 million increasing from 442 million in 2020 and amortization of acquired intangible assets totaled 615 million rising from 190 million in 2020 exclusive of these items adjusted total expenses 1 were 97 billion in 2021 increasing 44 from 2020 

return on average common stockholders’ equity was 11 in 2021 growing from 9 in 2020 and return on tangible common equity 1 rotce was 22 in 2021 up from 15 in 2020 the increases in both return on average common stockholders’ equity and rotce were primarily a result of significantly higher net income in 2021

the company continued its consistent approach to balance sheet management in 2021 supporting overall growth and liquidity total balance sheet assets rose to 6673 billion at december 31 2021 increasing 22 from yearend 2020 driven primarily by client asset flows as well as 106 billion in bda balance migrations we also added a net 102 billion to outstanding shortterm borrowings and longterm debt for liquidity management purposes and increased preferred stock by a net 23 billion to help support continued business growth the company’s tier 1 leverage ratio was 62 at yearend 2021 

though significantly heightened client activity levels during the first quarter of 2021 impacted our service quality at times we took multiple actions to better deliver the service experience our clients deserve and rely on including enhancing online selfservice capabilities streamlining our callrouting processes and increasing hiring our efforts began yielding results early in the year with significant improvement in client service levels by the end of the first quarter and our service levels continued to be improved throughout the remainder of 2021 as client activity moderated 

2020 compared to 2019 

throughout the extraordinary macroeconomic environment that persisted during 2020 schwab continued to execute on key strategic initiatives and produced solid financial results the impact of covid19 along with social and political turmoil created an unprecedented combination of personal and macroeconomic challenges for our clients employees and stockholders while working through these challenges we progressed in advancing the company’s strategic goals to drive scale monetization and segmentation in ways that benefit our clients among the company’s key accomplishments in 2020 were the successful completion of the acquisition of td ameritrade and three other strategic acquisitions as discussed below 

the covid19 pandemic’s rapid escalation in early 2020 was accompanied by volatile equity markets and the federal reserve’s further easing of monetary policy as the year progressed government aid packages and vaccine developments helped settle the markets with the sp 500 ® erasing its pandemicrelated losses to finish up 16 for the year throughout 2020 client engagement with the financial markets greatly increased over the prior year as client trading activity reached record levels core net new assets totaled 2819 billion in 2020 representing our third consecutive year of over 200 billion total client assets reached 669 trillion spread across 296 million brokerage accounts up 66 and 140 respectively from yearend 2019 

against this backdrop schwab’s net income totaled 33 billion down 405 million or 11 from 2019 while the company produced diluted eps of 212 representing a decrease of 21 relative to 2019 adjusted diluted eps 1 amounted to 245 in 2020 down 9 from 270 in 2019 

total net revenues reached 117 billion for the year increasing 9 from 2019 during march 2020 the federal reserve acted to support the economy by cutting the fed funds rate from 175 to near zero and announcing significant asset purchase programs mortgage refinancing activity subsequently accelerated and our net interest margin was impacted by both significantly lower interest rates and increased prepayments of mortgagebacked securities held in our investment portfolio strong growth in interestearning assets via client inflows and allocation decisions as well as our acquisitions of td ameritrade and assets of usaaimco helped limit the decrease in net interest revenue to 6 resulting in a fullyear 2020 total of 61 billion 

growing balances in advisory solutions and a rebound in equity markets in 2020 helped drive an 8 increase in asset management and administration fees which totaled 35 billion in 2020 record client trading activity and the addition of td ameritrade in the fourth quarter contributed to an 88 increase in trading revenue which reached 14 billion for the year more than offsetting a fullyear impact of the commission reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of 2019 with the td ameritrade acquisition our fourth quarter 2020 results included bank deposit account fee revenue for the first time which totaled 355 million for the period from october 6 through december 31 2020 

total expenses excluding interest increased 26 in 2020 to 74 billion which included significant costs related to our acquisitions with the completion of four acquisitions during the year acquisition and integrationrelated costs totaled 442 million in 2020 representing a significant increase from the 26 million incurred in 2019 amortization of acquired intangible assets also increased totaling 190 million in 2020 compared with 27 million in 2019 exclusive of these items adjusted total expenses 1 increased 16 from 2019 return on average common stockholders’ equity was 9 in 2020 down from 19 in 2019 rotce 1 was 15 in 2020 down from 21 in 2019 the 2020 decreases in both return on average common stockholders’ equity and rotce were due to lower net income as well as significantly higher balances of common equity due to the tda acquisition and higher aoci in 2020 driven by unrealized gains in our afs investment portfolio

business and asset acquisitions 

td ameritrade 

effective october 6 2020 the company completed its acquisition of td ameritrade td ameritrade provides securities brokerage services including trade execution clearing services and margin lending through its brokerdealer subsidiaries and futures and foreign exchange trade execution services through its fcm and fdm subsidiary at the time of closing td ameritrade had approximately 16 trillion in client assets and approximately 145 million brokerage accounts td ameritrade’s assets and liabilities were revalued and recorded at their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition 

the company expects to continue to incur significant acquisition and integrationrelated costs and integrationrelated capital expenditures throughout the integration process such costs have included and are expected to continue to include professional fees such as legal advisory and accounting fees compensation and benefits expenses for employees and contractors involved in the integration work and costs for technology enhancements the company has also incurred exit and other related costs to attain anticipated synergies which are primarily comprised of employee compensation and benefits such as severance pay other termination benefits and retention costs as well as costs related to facility closures such as accelerated amortization and depreciation or impairments of assets in those locations 

the company’s estimates of the nature amounts and timing of recognition of acquisition and integrationrelated costs remain subject to change based on a number of factors including the expected duration and complexity of the integration process and the continued uncertainty of the current economic environment more specifically factors that could cause variability in our expected acquisition and integrationrelated costs include the level of employee attrition workforce redeployment from eliminated positions into open roles changes in the levels of client activity as well as increased real estaterelated exit cost variability due to effects of the covid19 pandemic including changes in remote working trends 

as a result of the significant growth seen beginning in late 2020 and early 2021 across key client volume metrics including the number of active brokerage accounts dats and peak daily trades the company determined in 2021 to increase the scope of technology work related to the integration in 2021 we commenced greater technology buildout to support the expanded volumes of our combined client base based on our current integration plans and expanded scope of technology work the company continues to expect to complete client conversion within 30 to 36 months from the october 6 2020 acquisition date and we expect to incur total acquisition and integrationrelated costs and capital expenditures of between 20 billion and 22 billion 

acquisition and integrationrelated costs which are inclusive of related exit costs totaled 468 million and 442 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively and the company expects to incur acquisition and integrationrelated costs of approximately 350400 million in 2022 over the course of the integration we continue to expect to realize annualized cost synergies of between 18 billion and 20 billion and through december 31 2021 we have achieved approximately half of this amount on an annualized runrate basis the company expects to have realized approximately 60 of our estimated annualized cost synergies by yearend 2022 with much of the remaining estimated cost synergies expected to be realized after the completion of client conversion and into 2024 estimated timing and amounts of synergy realization are subject to change as we progress in the integration see also results of operations – total expenses excluding interest nongaap financial measures and item 8 – notes 3 and 16

net interest revenue 

schwab’s primary interestearning assets include cash and cash equivalents cash and investments segregated margin loans which constitute the majority of receivables from brokerage clients investment securities and bank loans revenue on interestearning assets is affected by various factors such as the composition of assets prevailing interest rates and spreads at the time of origination or purchase changes in interest rates on floating rate securities and loans and changes in prepayment levels for mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities and loans fees earned and expenses incurred on securities lending and borrowing activities are conducted by our brokerdealer subsidiaries using assets held in client brokerage accounts 

schwab’s interestbearing liabilities include bank deposits payables to brokerage clients shortterm borrowings eg federal home loan bank fhlb advances commercial paper secured borrowings by our brokerdealer subsidiaries repurchase agreements and longterm debt schwab deploys the funds from these sources into the assets outlined above as schwab builds its client base we attract new client sweep cash which is a primary driver of funding balance sheet growth we do not use shortterm wholesale borrowings to support our longterm investment activity but may use such funding for shortterm liquidity purposes or to provide temporary funding noninterestbearing funding sources include stockholders’ equity certain client cash balances and other miscellaneous liabilities

the company’s investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise while attempting to moderate the decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall in order to keep interestrate sensitivity within established limits management actively monitors and adjusts interestrate sensitivity through changes in the balance sheet primarily by adjusting the composition of our banking subsidiaries’ investment portfolios schwab establishes the rates paid on clientrelated liabilities and management expects that it will generally adjust the rates paid on these liabilities at some fraction of any movement in shortterm rates see also risk management – interest rate risk simulations 

as the us economic recovery continued in 2021 interest rates remained historically low shortterm rates remained near zero throughout 2021 longerterm interest rates began to rise early in the year then remained largely unchanged before rising again in the fourth quarter elevated levels of prepayments on mortgagebacked securities persisted throughout the continued low interest rate environment in 2021 and resulted in accelerated reinvestment of the afs portfolio purchases of afs securities totaled 1717 billion schwab saw consistent strength in new client brokerage accounts and net new client assets throughout 2021 driving growth in schwab’s interestearning assets at the same time client engagement in the equity markets increased and clients were net buyers of equity securities and other investment products resulting in outflows of client cash and partially offsetting the growth in interestearning assets 

late in the first quarter of 2020 the federal reserve cut the federal funds target overnight rate from 175 to near zero on the longer end of the curve the 10year treasury rate declined by over 120 basis points lower interest rates across maturities persisted from the end of the first quarter through the end of 2020 while credit spreads also compressed moreover changes in the economic environment throughout 2020 resulting from the covid19 pandemic drove significantly higher levels of client cash sweep balances as these balances rapidly accumulated in the first quarter of 2020 the company initially placed a substantial amount in excess reserves held at the federal reserve and subsequently deployed a significant amount of this cash buildup throughout 2020 afs securities purchases in 2020 totaled 2022 billion and these purchases were made at rates below the average yield on the existing afs portfolio due to the low interest rate environment

net interest revenue increased 19 billion or 31 in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to the inclusion of td ameritrade as well as significant growth in overall interestearning assets including higher investment portfolio balances and margin lending as well as growth in securities lending revenue and bank loans partially offset by lower average yields accelerated premium amortization stemming from elevated prepayments of mortgagerelated debt securities in the afs portfolio continued in 2021 and partially offset the growth in net interest revenue net premium amortization of investment securities totaled 23 billion in 2021 and 16 billion in 2020 td ameritrade contributed total net interest revenue of 19 billion during the year ended december 31 2021 and 443 million in 2020 from october 6 through december 31 2020 

average interestearning assets for 2021 were higher by 46 compared to 2020 this increase was largely due to higher bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients which resulted from strong net new client asset inflows continued heightened client cash allocations driven by the low interest rate environment bda balance migrations and the inclusion of td ameritrade for all of 2021 

our net interest margin declined to 145 in 2021 from 162 in 2020 this decrease was driven primarily by lower overall yields received on interestearning assets in part due to purchases of investment securities in 2020 and 2021 at rates below the average yield on the afs portfolio this more than offset the benefit of increased securities lending revenue and higher margin utilization in 2021 which comprised 39 of net interest revenue during 2021 growing from 19 of net interest revenue in 2020 

net interest revenue decreased 403 million or 6 in 2020 from 2019 due primarily to lower average investment yields partially offset by growth in interestearning assets and our acquisition of td ameritrade accelerated premium amortization on debt securities in 2020 also contributed to the reduction in net interest revenue as the decline in longterm interest rates in 2020 resulted in higher prepayments of mortgagerelated debt securities average interestearning assets for 2020 were higher by 40 compared to 2019 this increase in average interestearning assets was primarily driven by higher client cash balances in bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients due to higher client cash allocations and our acquisitions of td ameritrade and assets of usaaimco td ameritrade contributed approximately 120 billion of average interestearning assets and 96 billion of average interestbearing liabilities to schwab’s fullyear 2020 averages 

our net interest margin decreased to 162 in 2020 from 241 in 2019 this decrease was driven primarily by lower yields received on interestearning assets due largely to the federal reserve’s 2019 and 2020 interest rate reductions as well as higher premium amortization on mortgagerelated debt securities due to the low interest rate environment purchases of investment securities in 2020 were made at rates below the average yield on the existing afs portfolio which negatively impacted our net interest margin

asset management and administration fees increased by 264 million or 8 in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to higher balances in advice solutions including managed account assets from usaa and td ameritrade overall gains in equity markets as well as higher purchased money market funds and other thirdparty mutual funds and etfs in 2020 relative to 2019 these increases were partially offset by the effect of money market fund fee waivers due to declining portfolio yields

trading revenue 

trading revenue includes commissions order flow revenue and principal transaction revenues commission revenue is affected by volume and mix of trades executed order flow revenue is comprised of rebate payments received from trade execution venues to which our brokerdealer subsidiaries send equity and option orders order flow revenue is affected by volume and mix of client trades as well as pricing received from trade execution venues principal transaction revenue is recognized primarily as a result of accommodating clients’ fixed income trading activity and includes adjustments to the fair value of securities positions held to facilitate such client trading activity

note effective october 7 2019 csco eliminated online trade commissions for us and canadianlisted stocks and etfs as well as the base charge on options td ameritrade inc also does not charge for these types of trades and does not have a base charge on options 

1 revenue per trade is calculated as trading revenue divided by dats multiplied by the number of trading days 

trading revenue increased 27 billion or 193 in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the acquisition of td ameritrade and heightened client engagement which drove significantly higher dats throughout 2021 this increased trading activity and a higher percentage of derivatives trades drove significant growth in commissions and order flow revenue overall td ameritrade contributed 33 billion of trading revenue during the year ended december 31 2021 compared with 667 million of trading revenue from october 6 2020 through december 31 2020 

trading revenue increased by 664 million or 88 in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the acquisition of td ameritrade in addition the company saw a significant increase in dats and higher order flow revenue in 2020 which were partially offset by the company’s october 2019 pricing actions order flow revenue increased by 486 million in 2020 compared to 2019 this increase in order flow revenue in 2020 was due to the acquisition of td ameritrade and a higher volume of trades throughout 2020 relative to 2019 

bank deposit account fees 

in connection with our acquisition of td ameritrade the company began earning bank deposit account fee revenue beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 pursuant to the ida agreement and arrangements with other thirdparty banks bank deposit account fees are primarily affected by average bda balances and the floating and fixedrate reference yields fees earned under the ida agreement are affected by changes in interest rates and the composition of balances designated as fixed and floatingrate 

bank deposit account fees totaled 13 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 and 355 million from october 6 2020 through december 31 2020 during the year ended december 31 2021 and the period of october 6 2020 through december 31 2020 the total average bda balance was 1584 billion and 1613 billion respectively of which approximately 80 was designated as fixedrate obligation amounts and approximately 20 as floatingrate obligation amounts for both periods 

during 2021 the company transferred 106 billion of bda balances to its balance sheet from the td depository institutions and other thirdparty banks transfers of bda balances to schwab’s balance sheet result in lower balances upon which bank deposit account fee revenue is earned but provide a source of funding to invest in interestearning assets to increase net interest revenue see also capital management and item 8 – note 15 for discussion of the ida agreement and the potential to move ida balances to schwab’s balance sheet

schwab’s effective income tax rate on income before taxes was 241 in 2021 233 in 2020 and 236 in 2019 the increase in the effective tax rate in 2021 from 2020 was primarily related to nonrecurring federal tax benefits recognized in 2020 including settlement of the irs examination for tax years 20112014 the tax impact of a nondeductible regulatory matter charge in 2021 see item 8 – note 15 and additional income tax expense from the filing of 2020 tax returns during 2021 partially offsetting the increases in the effective tax rate from these items was an increase in equity compensation tax deduction benefits during 2021 the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to federal and state tax benefits recognized during 2020 including settlement of the irs examination of tax years 20112014 the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain federal and state uncertain tax positions and tax benefits realized from the filing of state tax returns as well as an increase in lowincome housing tax credit lihtc benefits offsetting the decrease in the effective tax rate from these items was an increase in nondeductible acquisition costs and fdic insurance premium disallowance as well as a decrease in equity compensation tax deduction benefits 

segment information 

revenues and expenses are attributed to the two segments based on which segment services the client management evaluates the performance of the segments on a pretax basis segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments net revenues in both segments are generated from the underlying client assets and trading activity differences in the composition of net revenues between the segments are based on the composition of client assets client trading frequency and pricing unique to each while both segments leverage the scale and efficiency of our platforms segment expenses reflect the dynamics of serving millions of clients in investor services versus the thousands of rias on the advisor services platform 

the company integrated its business and asset acquisitions during 2020 into its two existing reportable segments revenues and expenses from our acquisition of usaaimco are allocated to investor services only revenues and expenses from td ameritrade and our other 2020 acquisitions are attributed to both investor services and advisor services based on which segment services the client see item 8 – note 3 for more information regarding acquisitions 

financial information for our segments is presented in the following table 



1 in 2021 investor services includes outflows of 420 billion from mutual fund clearing services clients

segment net revenues 

investor services and advisor services total net revenues increased by 68 and 32 respectively in 2021 compared to 2020 both segments experienced growth in all revenue line items primarily due to the fullyear inclusion of td ameritrade’s results in 2021 in addition net interest revenue increased for advisor services due to growth in interestearning assets partially offset by lower average yields growth in asset management and administration fees in investor services was supported by growth in advice solutions and asset management and administration fees increased in both segments due to rising balances in proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds and etfs partially offset by money market fund fee waivers and lower money market fund balances the increase in trading revenue for investor services was supported by heightened client trading activity bank deposit account fee revenue was earned at both segments for the full year in 2021 compared to only the fourth quarter of 2020 following the october 6 2020 td ameritrade acquisition 

investor services total net revenues increased by 13 in 2020 from 2019 while advisor services total net revenues remained relatively consistent yearoveryear investor services’ growth was primarily due to an increase in trading revenue higher asset management and administration fees and the initial recognition of bank deposit account fees in the fourth quarter of 2020 partially offset by lower net interest revenue for advisor services bank deposit account fees largely offset a decrease in net interest revenue while trading revenue and asset management and administration fees were consistent with 2019 trading revenue increased significantly in the investor services segment primarily due to the td ameritrade acquisition and higher trade volumes in 2020 asset management and administration fees increased in 2020 for investor services primarily due to higher balances in advice solutions including managed account assets from usaa and td ameritrade as well as higher purchased money market funds and other thirdparty mutual funds and etfs partially offset by the effect of money fund fee waivers net interest revenue decreased for both segments primarily due to lower average investment yields partially offset by growth in interestearning assets 

segment expenses excluding interest 

investor services and advisor services total expenses excluding interest increased by 50 and 35 respectively in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of td ameritrade’s results of operations in addition both segments saw higher compensation and benefits expenses due to additional headcount increases to support our expanding client base and service levels amidst heightened client engagement higher bonus accrual as well as annual merit increases and a 5 employee salary increase that went into effect late in the third quarter for investor services total expenses excluding interest also increased due to a charge of approximately 200 million in 2021 for a regulatory matter see item 8 – note 15 

investor services and advisor services total expenses excluding interest increased by 29 and 17 respectively in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the inclusion of td ameritrade’s expenses from october 6 2020 forward and acquisition and integrationrelated costs compensation and benefits increased in both segments primarily due to the acquisition of tda and overall headcount growth to support our expanding client base with investor services increasing more significantly due to greater headcount growth from the tda acquisition and the hiring of approximately 400 former usaa employees in connection with the usaaimco acquisition both segments also saw increases in professional services depreciation and amortization amortization of acquired intangible assets and other expenses primarily due to the inclusion of tda’s expenses from october 6 2020 forward as well as acquisition and integrationrelated costs with investor services’ expenses increasing more significantly due to overall size of the segment’s client base and greater client base growth from tda

liquidity and investment portfolios 

schwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios which include us agency and nonagency mortgagebacked securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities us agency notes us treasury securities certificates of deposit us state and municipal securities commercial paper and foreign government agency securities 

at december 31 2021 substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade us agency mortgagebacked securities do not have explicit credit ratings however management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the us government or us governmentsponsored enterprises 

mortgage lending portfolio 

the bank loan portfolio includes first mortgages helocs pals discussed below and other loans the credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews management regularly reviews asset quality including concentrations delinquencies nonaccrual loans chargeoffs and recoveries all are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses 

our residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum ltv ratios cash out limits and minimum fair isaac corporation fico credit scores the specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan for example whether the property is a primary or secondary residence whether the loan is for investment property whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo 

schwab does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a fico score of less than 620 at origination unless the borrower has compensating credit factors for more information on credit quality indicators relating to schwab’s bank loans see item 8 – note 7 

securities and instrumentbased lending portfolios 

collateral arrangements relating to margin loans pals option and futures positions securities lending agreements and securities purchased under agreements to resell resale agreements include provisions that require additional collateral in the event of market fluctuations additionally for margin loans pals options and futures positions and securities lending agreements collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral sufficiently exceeds the credit exposure in order to maintain a fully secured position 

other counterparty exposures 

schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations mutual funds and other financial institutions even if schwab’s clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to the company 

market risk 

market risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or market conditions schwab is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates within our interestearning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets 

to manage interest rate risk we have established policies and procedures which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity eve risk to remain within these limits we manage the maturity repricing and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios management monitors established guidelines to stay within the company’s risk appetite 

our measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and as a result cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue bank deposit account fees or eve actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes 

 47

tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted 

as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies including changes in asset and liability mix financial instruments are also subject to the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument 

we are indirectly exposed to option futures and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers and client securities loaned out as part of the brokerage securities lending activities equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity margin borrowing and overall client engagement with schwab additionally we earn mutual fund and etf service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue we earn 

our market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material 

interest rate risk simulations 

net interest revenue simulation 

for our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulations include all balance sheet interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments repricing of financial instruments and reinvestment of matured or paiddown securities and loans 

net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets include investment securities margin loans and bank loans these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans and control the composition of our investment securities we have some ability to manage our net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions 

net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment 

the following table shows the simulated change to net interest revenue over the next 12 months beginning december 31 2021 and 2020 of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period 



the company’s simulated increase of 100 basis points in market interest rates had a slightly lower impact on net interest revenue at yearend 2021 compared with yearend 2020 due to an increase in the company’s projected repricing of client deposit rates across higher market interest rate scenarios which was partially offset as a result of holding a higher allocation of floatingrate assets on the balance sheet at december 31 2021 relative to the prior yearend a simulated decrease of 100 basis points in market interest rates had a slightly larger impact yearoveryear primarily as a result of holding a higher allocation of floatingrate assets 

higher shortterm interest rates would positively impact net interest revenue as yields on interestearning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources a decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the company’s investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources compressing net interest margin

tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted 

in addition to measuring the effect of a gradual 100 basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel and nonparallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue 

bank deposit account fees simulation 

consistent with the presentation on the consolidated statement of income the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the net interest revenue simulation described above as of december 31 2021 and 2020 simulated changes in bank deposit account fee revenue from gradual 100 basis point changes in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates did not have a significant impact on the company’s total net revenues 

economic value of equity simulation 

management also uses eve simulations to measure interest rate risk eve sensitivity measures the longterm impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment key assumptions in our eve calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments term structure models of interest rates nonmaturity deposit behavior and pricing assumptions our net interest revenue bank deposit account fee revenue and eve simulations reflect the assumption of nonnegative investment yields 

phaseout of libor 

the company continues to prepare for the phasingout of libor undertaking many efforts coordinated by its firmwide transition team the libor transition team is overseen by executive leadership and has organized its efforts to address both clientimpacting and nonclientimpacting workstreams from a client perspective the company has established pages on the clientfacing websites for csco and td ameritrade inc to provide information for our clients to help them understand how they may be impacted by libor’s discontinuation in addition we maintain internal informational resources for our clientfacing employees’ awareness regarding libor’s phaseout 

the company’s largest exposures to libor are certain investment securities and loans in purchasing new investment securities we ensure that appropriate fallback language is in place in the event that libor becomes unavailable or is deemed unreliable and we have sold certain securities lacking appropriate fallback language additionally in accordance with regulatory feedback we are limiting our purchases of liborbased securities and we ensure that any new purchases of liborbased securities were issued prior to january 1 2022 as of december 31 2021 substantially all of the company’s remaining investment securities with exposure to libor provide for appropriate fallback in the event libor is no longer available consistent with guidance from the alternative reference rate committee a group of privatemarket participants jointly convened by the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york to help ensure a successful transition from libor the company phasedout the use of libor as a reference rate in new loans prior to yearend 2021 and the company’s portfolio of legacy loans have fallback language if libor is no longer available 

certain of the company’s technology systems and financial models have historically utilized libor and we have now substantially transitioned our financial models and systems to alternative reference rates in addition we have transitioned the company’s ida agreement and certain intercompany lending agreements that previously were tied to libor to other appropriate reference rates 

additional transition efforts to prepare for the phasingout of libor are ongoing the floating dividend rates for our series a e and f preferred stock are based on libor in addition operational work remains to transition our legacy loan portfolio in accordance with expected regulatory guidance to alternate reference rates that are consistent with the fallback language included in the contracts

due to its role as a source of financial strength csc’s liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of csco td ameritrade inc and tdac our principal brokerdealer subsidiaries the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries principal and interest due on corporate debt dividend payments on csc’s preferred stock and returns of capital to common stockholders the liquidity needs of our brokerdealer subsidiaries are primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin lending activities and capital expenditures the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries are primarily driven by client deposit levels we have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions we seek to maintain client confidence in the balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the company to meet its obligations to this end we have established limits and contingency funding scenarios to support liquidity levels during both business as usual and stressed conditions 

we employ a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity we conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during marketrelated or companyspecific liquidity stress events liquidity is also tested at certain subsidiaries and results are reported to the financial risk oversight committee a number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the organization and are reviewed with management as appropriate 

primary funding sources 

schwab’s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts these funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients 

other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations maturities and sales of investment securities repayments on loans securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts repurchase agreements and cash provided by external financing 

to meet daily funding needs we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and shortterm investments for unanticipated liquidity needs we also maintain a buffer of highly liquid investments including us treasury securities 

additional funding sources 

in addition to internal sources of liquidity schwab has access to external funding the need for shortterm borrowings from external debt facilities arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements scheduled liquidation of interestearning investments movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements and general corporate purposes we maintain policies and procedures necessary to access funding and test discount window borrowing procedures on a periodic basis 

the following table describes external debt facilities available at december 31 2021 



1 in october 2021 the company increased the amount of commercial paper available to issue from 15 billion to 50 billion 

2 secured borrowing capacity is made available based on tdac’s ability to provide acceptable collateral to the lenders as determined by the credit agreements 

our banking subsidiaries maintain secured credit facilities with the fhlb amounts available under these facilities are dependent on the value of our first mortgages helocs and the fair value of certain of our investment securities that are pledged as collateral these credit facilities are also available as backup financing in the event the outflow of client cash from the banking subsidiaries’ respective balance sheets is greater than maturities and paydowns on investment securities and bank loans

our banking subsidiaries also have access to shortterm secured funding through the federal reserve discount window amounts available under the federal reserve discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral our banking subsidiaries may also engage with external banks in repurchase agreements collateralized by investments securities as another source of shortterm liquidity 

csc has a commercial paper program of which proceeds are used for general corporate purposes the maturities of the commercial paper notes may vary but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue csc’s ratings for these shortterm borrowings were p1 by moody’s a1 by standard  poor’s and f1 by fitch at december 31 2021 and 2020 csc also has a universal automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec which enables it to issue debt equity and other securities csco maintains uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines with a group of banks as a source of shortterm liquidity which can also be accessed by csc tdac maintains a senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 600 million which matures in april 2022 tdac also maintains secured uncommitted lines of credit under which tdac borrows on either a demand or shortterm basis and pledges client margin securities as collateral 

to support growth in margin loan balances at our brokerdealer subsidiaries while meeting our lcr requirements the company issues commercial paper or draws on secured lines of credit in addition to capital markets issuances

capital management 

schwab seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of our business strategy including anticipated balance sheet growth inclusive of migration of ida balances see further discussion below providing financial support to our subsidiaries and sustained access to the capital markets while at the same time meeting our regulatory capital requirements and serving as a source of financial strength to our banking subsidiaries schwab’s primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of subsidiaries and securities issuances by csc in the capital markets to ensure that schwab has sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values we have adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios 

internal guidelines are set for both csc and its regulated subsidiaries to ensure capital levels are in line with our strategy and regulatory requirements capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at assetliability management and pricing committee and financial risk oversight committee meetings a number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify potential problems that could impact capital in addition we monitor the subsidiaries’ capital levels and requirements subject to regulatory capital requirements and any required approvals any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to csc in the form of dividends and returns of capital when subsidiaries have need of additional capital funds are provided by csc as equity investments and also as subordinated loans in a form approved as regulatory capital by regulators for csco the details and method used for each cash infusion are based on an analysis of the particular entity’s needs and financing alternatives the amounts and structure of infusions must take into consideration maintenance of regulatory capital requirements debtequity ratios and equity double leverage ratios 

schwab conducts regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various adverse macroeconomic and companyspecific events to which the company could be subjected the objective of the capital stress testing is 1 to explore various potential outcomes – including rare and extreme events and 2 to assess impacts of potential stressful outcomes on both capital and liquidity additionally we have a comprehensive capital contingency plan to provide action plans for certain low probabilityhigh impact capital events that the company might face the capital contingency plan is issued under the authority of the financial risk oversight committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events it does not specifically address every contingency but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress the results of the stress testing indicate there are two scenarios which could stress the company’s capital 1 inflows of balance sheet cash during a period of very low interest rates and 2 outflows of balance sheet cash when other sources of financing are not available and the company is required to sell assets to fund the flows at a loss the capital contingency plan is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate 

for additional information see business – regulation in part i item 1 

regulatory capital requirements 

csc is subject to capital requirements set by the federal reserve and is required to serve as a source of strength for our banking subsidiaries and to provide financial assistance if our banking subsidiaries experience financial distress schwab is required to maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio for csc of at least 4 and we have a longterm operating objective of 675700 due to the relatively low risk of our balance sheet assets and riskbased capital ratios at csc and csb that are well in excess of regulatory requirements the tier 1 leverage ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on csc’s asset growth 

our banking subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements set by their regulators that are substantially similar to those imposed on csc by the federal reserve our banking subsidiaries’ failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that could have a direct material effect on the banks schwab’s principal banking subsidiary csb is required to maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 to be well capitalized but seeks to maintain a ratio of at least 625 based on its regulatory capital ratios at december 31 2021 csb is considered well capitalized

csb is also subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions in addition csb is required to provide notice to and may be required to obtain approval from the federal reserve and the texas department of savings and mortgage lending tdsml to declare dividends to csc as brokerdealers csco tdac and td ameritrade inc are subject to regulatory requirements of the uniform net capital rule which is intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of brokerdealers these regulations prohibit the brokerdealer subsidiaries from paying cash dividends making unsecured advances and loans to csc and employees and repaying subordinated borrowings from csc if such payment would result in a net capital amount below prescribed thresholds at december 31 2021 csco tdac and td ameritrade inc were in compliance with their respective net capital requirements 

in addition to the capital requirements above schwab’s subsidiaries are subject to other regulatory requirements intended to ensure financial soundness and liquidity see item 8 – note 23 for additional information on the components of stockholders’ equity and information on the capital requirements of significant subsidiaries 

the following table details the capital ratios for csc consolidated and csb 



as a result of significant inflows of client cash in 2020 our tier 1 leverage ratio for consolidated csc and csb declined below our longterm operating objectives in 2021 the company’s issuances of preferred stock and strength in earnings helped to largely maintain our tier 1 leverage ratio even as bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients grew by a total of 1072 billion or 23 during the year we ended 2021 with a consolidated tier 1 leverage ratio of 62 down slightly from the prior yearend of 63 earnings in 2021 as well as capital contributions from csc drove an increase in csb’s tier 1 leverage ratio from 55 at yearend 2020 to 71 at yearend 2021 though our tier 1 leverage ratio is below our longterm operating objective for consolidated csc this ratio is well above the regulatory minimum the pace of return to our longterm operating objective over time depends on a number of factors including the overall size of the company’s balance sheet earnings and capital issuance and deployment 

ida agreement 

through december 31 2021 schwab had moved 101 billion of ida balances to its balance sheet which included uninsured balances and certain international account balances the company’s overall capital management strategy includes supporting migration of ida balances in future periods as available pursuant to the terms of the ida agreement the company’s ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent upon multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain

fair value of financial instruments 

schwab uses the market approach to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value and to determine fair value disclosures see item 8 – notes 2 and 18 for more information on our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 

critical accounting estimates 

the consolidated financial statements of schwab have been prepared in accordance with gaap item 8 – note 2 contains more information on our significant accounting policies made in applying these accounting principles 

while the majority of the revenues expenses assets and liabilities are not based on estimates there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on schwab’s financial position and financial results these critical accounting estimates are described below management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy 

management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors additionally management has reviewed with the audit committee the company’s significant estimates discussed in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

income taxes 

schwab estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate including federal state and local domestic jurisdictions and immaterial amounts owed to several foreign jurisdictions the estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statements of income in taxes on income accrued taxes are reported in other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes deferred tax assets are recognized if in management’s judgment their realizability is determined to be more likely than not uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize an uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement in estimating accrued taxes we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances 

changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates interpretations of tax laws the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities and newly enacted statutory judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions these changes when they occur affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the operating results of the company see item 8 – note 22 for more information on the company’s income taxes

legal and regulatory reserves 

reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter after considering among other factors the progress of the case prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases available defenses and the opinions and views of legal counsel in many cases including most class action lawsuits it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred or to estimate the range of that loss until the matter is close to resolution in which case no accrual is made until that time reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved see item 8 – note 15 for more information on the company’s contingencies related to legal and regulatory reserves 

business combinations 

we have accounted for our acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date as we allocate the purchase price to the estimated fair values of acquired tangible and intangible assets and the liabilities assumed we also use our best estimates to determine the useful lives of the tangible and definitelived intangible assets which impact the periods over which depreciation and amortization of those assets are recognized these best estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain as they pertain to forward looking views of our businesses client behavior and market conditions in our acquisitions we have also recognized goodwill at the amount by which the purchase price paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired see item 8 – notes 2 and 3 for more information on our valuation methods and the results of applying the acquisition method of accounting including the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and where relevant the estimated remaining useful lives 

our ongoing accounting for goodwill and the tangible and intangible assets acquired requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions as we exercise judgement to evaluate these assets for impairment our processes and accounting policies for evaluating impairments are further described in item 8 – note 2 one of our reporting units has an immaterial amount of goodwill the results of the 2021 annual goodwill impairment testing for our other two reporting units indicated that the estimated fair values substantially exceeded their carrying amounts

nongaap financial measures 

in addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain references to the nongaap financial measures described below we believe these nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information about the financial performance of the company and facilitate meaningful comparison of schwab’s results in the current period to both historic and future results these nongaap measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to nongaap financial measures presented by other companies 

schwab’s use of nongaap measures is reflective of certain adjustments made to gaap financial measures as described below 



the company also uses adjusted diluted eps and return on tangible common equity as components of performance criteria for employee bonus and certain executive management incentive compensation arrangements the compensation committee of csc’s board of directors maintains discretion in evaluating performance against these criteria 

the following tables present reconciliations of gaap measures to nongaap measures 



1 acquisition and integrationrelated costs for 2021 primarily consist of 283 million of compensation and benefits 132 million of professional services and 39 million of occupancy and equipment acquisition and integrationrelated costs for 2020 primarily consist of 235 million of compensation and benefits 158 million of professional services and 30 million of other expense substantially all acquisition and integrationrelated costs for 2019 are included in professional services expense

business strategy and competitive environment 

schwab was founded on the belief that all americans deserve access to a better investing experience although much has changed in the intervening years our purpose remains clear – to champion every client’s goals with passion and integrity guided by this purpose and our vision of creating the most trusted leader in investment services management has adopted a strategy described as “through clients’ eyes” 

this strategy emphasizes placing clients’ perspectives needs and desires at the forefront because investing plays a fundamental role in building financial security we strive to deliver a better investing experience for our clients – individual investors and the people and institutions who serve them – by disrupting longstanding industry practices on their behalf and providing superior service we also aim to offer a broad range of products and solutions to meet client needs with a focus on transparency value and trust in addition management works to couple schwab’s scale and resources with ongoing expense discipline to keep costs low and ensure that products and solutions are affordable as well as responsive to client needs in

the charles schwab corporation 

combination these are the key elements of our “no tradeoffs” approach to serving investors we believe that following this strategy is the best way to maximize our market valuation and stockholder returns over time 

management estimates that investable wealth in the united states us consisting of assets in defined contribution retail wealth management and brokerage and registered investment advisor channels along with bank deposits currently exceeds 50 trillion which means the company’s 669 trillion in client assets leaves substantial opportunity for growth our strategy is based on the principle that developing trusted relationships will translate into more assets from both new and existing clients ultimately driving more revenue and along with expense discipline and thoughtful capital management will generate earnings growth and build longterm stockholder value 

within investor services our competition in serving individual investors spans brokerage wealth management and asset management firms as well as banks and trust companies in the advisor services arena we compete with institutional custodians traditional and discount brokers banks and trust companies 

across both segments our key competitive advantages are 

• scale and size of the business – as one of the largest investment services firms in the us we are able to spread operating costs and amortize new investments over a large base of clients and harness the resources to evolve capabilities to meet client needs 

• operating efficiency – coupled with scale our operating efficiency and sharing of infrastructure across different businesses creates a cost advantage that enables us to competitively price products and services while profitably serving clients of various sizes across multiple channels 

• operating structure – providing bank and asset management services to brokerdealer clients helps serve a wider array of needs thereby deepening relationships enhancing the stability of client assets and enabling diversified revenue streams 

• brand and corporate reputation – in an industry dependent on trust schwab’s reputation and brand across multiple constituents enable us to attract clients and employees while credibly introducing new products to the market 

• service culture – delivering a great client experience earns the trust and loyalty of clients and increases the likelihood that those clients will refer others 

• willingness to disrupt – management’s willingness to challenge the status quo including our own business practices to benefit clients fosters innovation and continuous improvement which helps to attract more clients and assets

 item 1a risk factors 

we face a variety of risks that may affect our operations financial results or stock price and many of those risks are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict the following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant although there may be other risks that could arise or may prove to be more significant than expected that may affect our operations or financial results 

for a discussion of our risk management governance and processes including operational risk compliance risk credit risk market risk and liquidity risk see risk management and capital management in part ii item 7 

general economic and market risks 

the challenging economic environment triggered by the coronavirus covid19 pandemic has impacted and will continue to impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

the covid‑19 pandemic has adversely impacted the economic environment leading to lower interest rates across the curve and heightened volatility in the financial markets these developments have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our net interest revenue bank deposit account fee revenue and asset management and administration fees additionally in march 2020 we experienced a significant increase in client cash balances held at our bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries which caused our tier 1 leverage ratio to decline into the buffer we maintain between our longterm operating objective and our regulatory requirement this will limit our ability to return excess capital to stockholders including through share repurchases until the ratio returns to higher levels 

credit markets have been and may continue to be adversely impacted due to both uncertainty regarding the pandemic’s economic impact and the anticipation that high levels of unemployment will have a significant impact on retail credit and commercial real estate forbearances and delinquencies we have experienced and may continue to experience higher levels of delinquencies on our portfolios of first mortgages and home equity lines of credit we also have experienced and may in the future experience material marketdriven credit spread movements in certain sectors within our portfolio of investment securities particularly within our investments in corporate credit securities assetbacked securities municipal securities and commercial mortgagebacked securities 

certain of our client service response and processing times have increased as a result of very high levels of client engagement and our clients have experienced and continue to occasionally experience delays accessing and using our website and mobile applications many of our employees and those of our outsourced service providers are working remotely and this has at times contributed to the increase in response and processing times particularly when we have experienced the temporary loss of services from some of our outsourced service providers we consider service quality to be an important part of the client experience and our failure to meet client expectations could result in decreased client satisfaction the covid19 pandemic could make the timely achievement of our td ameritrade integration milestones more challenging particularly with regard to technology and systems 

these and other impacts of the covid‑19 pandemic have had and will likely continue to have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described elsewhere in this “risk factors” section the extent to which the covid‑19 pandemic or the emergence of another widespread health crisis impacts our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain including the scope and duration of the outbreak actions taken by governmental authorities to contain the financial and economic impact and the spread of the outbreak the effect on our clients employees and outsourced service providers further changes in credit quality and spreads and reactions in the financial markets 

developments in the business economic and geopolitical environment could negatively impact our business 

our business can be adversely affected by the general environment – economic corporate securities market regulatory and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations trading activity interest rates and overall investor engagement and are outside of our control deterioration in the housing and credit markets reduction in interest rates and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact our results of operations and capital resources

the charles schwab corporation 

the monetary policies of the federal reserve which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states have a significant effect on our operating results actions taken by the federal reserve including changes in its target funds rate and balance sheet management are difficu lt to predict and can affect our net interest revenue and bank deposit account fees these policies could also have implications for clients’ allocation to cash higher or lower client cash balances have an impact on our capital requirements as well as liquidity implications if such changes in allocation are sudden  

a significant change in client cash allocations could negatively impact our income 

we rely heavily on client cash balances to generate revenue cash awaiting investment in a portion of our client brokerage accounts is swept to our banking subsidiaries and those bank deposits are then used to extend loans to clients and purchase investment securities we also sweep a portion of such cash pursuant to the ida agreement which requires us to maintain a minimum ida sweep balance a significant reduction in our clients’ allocation to cash a change in the allocation of that cash or a transfer of cash away from the company could reduce our income 

significant interest rate changes could affect our profitability 

the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings a decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on our net interest revenue and our bank deposit account fee revenue a low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact on our asset management and administration fee revenues when we have to waive a portion of our management fees for certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds in order to continue providing a positive return to clients the significant reduction in interest rates related to the covid19 pandemic has had and will continue to have a negative impact on our revenue related to interest rates and has caused us to waive management fees for certain funds 

although we believe we are positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment a rise in interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase if market conditions or the competitive environment induces us to raise our interest rates to avoid losing deposits or replace deposits with higher cost funding sources without offsetting increases in yields on interestearning assets can reduce our net interest revenue 

the announced phaseout of libor could negatively impact our net interest revenue and will continue to require significant operational work 

certain securities in our investment portfolio and the floating rate loans we offer reference libor as the benchmark rate to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount we also use libor in many of our financial models such as those used for capital stress testing and to determine the dividend rates for certain of our series of preferred stock which begin to float in 2022 and later if libor is discontinued as announced there will be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments and there will continue to be significant work required to transition to using the new benchmark rates and implement necessary changes to our systems and financial models this could result in different financial performance for previously booked transactions and may impact our existing transaction data products systems operations and pricing processes the calculation of interest rates under the replacement benchmarks could also impact our net interest revenue in addition libor may perform differently during the phaseout period than in the past which could result in lower interest payments and a reduction in the value of certain securities in our investment portfolio 

compliance risks 

extensive regulation of our businesses may subject us to significant penalties or limitations on business activities 

as a participant in the securities banking and financial services industries we are subject to extensive regulation under federal state and foreign laws by governmental agencies supervisory authorities and sros the costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase these regulations affect our business operations and impose capital client prote ction and market conduct requirements on us as well as restrictions on the activities that we are allowed to conduct we become subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny as we grow 

regulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies and could prevent us from pursuing our business strategy regulators could also limit our ability to grow including adding assets launching new products making acquisitions and undertaking strategic investments our banking regulators could require csc andor our banking subsidiaries to hold more capital increase liquidity or limit their ability to pay dividends or csc’s ability to repurchase or redeem shares 

 14  

the charles schwab corporation 

despite our efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements there are a number of risks particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by our regulators against us or our affiliates officers or employees could result in fines penalties cease and desist orders enforcement actions suspension disqualification or expulsion or other disciplinary sanctions including limitations on our business activities any of which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

while we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations violations could occur in addition some legalregulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time there may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance including restrictions on certain activities such a finding may also damage our reputation and our relationships with our regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities 

legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect our business and financial results 

new legislation rules regulations and guidance or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal state foreign and sro rules regulations and guidance including changes relating to mutual funds standards of conduct with clients conflicts of interest and regulatory treatment of deposit accounts may directly affect our operations and profitability or our specific business lines our profitability could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally including changes to the laws governing taxation electronic commerce client privacy and security of client data in addition the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct modifications to our business practices more stringent capital and liquidity requirements increased deposit insurance assessments or additional costs and could limit our ability to return capital to stockholders these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance risk management treasury and operations functions 

failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect our financial condition 

csc together with its banking brokerdealer and fcmfdm subsidiaries must meet certain capital and liquidity standards subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of our capital and our internal assessment of our capital needs the uniform net capital rule limits the ability of our brokerdealer entities to transfer capital to csc and other affiliates new regulatory capital liquidity capital planning and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital including paying dividends stock repurchases and redemptions and may require us to increase our capital andor liquidity or to limit our growth failure by either csc or its banking subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have a negative impact on us in addition failure by csc or our banking subsidiaries to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy their capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer requirements would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as tier 1 capital or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could require us to liquidate assets deleverage or otherwise change our business andor investment plans which may adversely affect our financial results issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders 

in january 2021 the federal reserve adopted a final rule effective with the 2022 ccar cycle making large savings and loan holding companies including csc subject to the ccar process which requires submission of an annual capital plan the plan must include a description of all planned capital actions including dividends or stock repurchases over a ninequarter planning horizon beginning with the first quarter of the calendar year the capital plan is submitted the rule also imposes a stress capital buffer requirement floored at 25 percent of riskweighted assets that will replace csc’s current 25 percent capital conservation buffer for our riskbased capital ratios the stress capital buffer will equal as a percentage of total riskweighted assets the sum of i the difference between a firm’s starting common equity tier 1 capital ratio and the low point under the severely adverse scenario of the federal reserve’s supervisory stress test plus ii the ratio of the firm’s projected four quarters of common stock dividends for the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon to riskweighted assets as projected under ccar the imposition of a stress capital buffer requirement could change the way in which our minimum riskbased capital ratios are calculated and make us subject to progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions if we approach our minimum ratios this could lead to restrictions on our ability to pay or increase dividends or otherwise return capital to stockholders 

 15  

the charles schwab corporation 

if csc reaches 700 billion in total assets or 75 billion in crossjurisdictional activity csc will become subject to more stringent category ii requirements including annual stress testing the advanced approaches framework and the inability to opt out of including aoci in regulatory capital calculations when csc’s weighted shortterm wholesale funding is 75 billion or more over the four most recent quarters csc will become subject to the full lcr rule and daily liquidity reporting and the full nsfr rule which goes into effect july 1 2021 csc anticipates exceeding the 75 billion threshold as of march 31 2021 

we are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending against claims or proceedings 

the financial services industry faces significant litigation and regulatory risks we are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business including arbitrations class actions and other litigation some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages we are also the subject of inquiries investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies 

litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by our clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied with us claims from clients of third party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors’ misconduct litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights eg patents such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources if we were found to have infringed on a thirdparty patent or other intellectual property rights we could incur substantial damages and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology or providing certain products or services 

actions brought against us may result in settlements awards injunctions fines penalties or other results adverse to us including reputational harm even if we are successful in defending against these actions the defense of such matters may result in us incurring significant expenses a substantial judgment settlement fine or penalty could be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular future period depending on our results for that period in market downturns and periods of heightened volatility the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased 

operational risk 

security breaches of our systems or those of our clients or third parties may subject us to significant liability and damage our reputation 

our business involves the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential information about our clients and us information security risks for financial institutions are increasing in part because of the use of the internet and mobile technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime activists hackers and other external parties including foreign state actors our systems and those of other financial institutions have been and will continue to be the target of cyber attacks malicious code computer viruses ransomware and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access misuse loss or destruction of data including confidential client information account takeovers unavailability of service or other events despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means for example employee misconduct 

given the high volume of transactions that we process the large number of clients counterparties and thirdparty service providers with which we do business and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected the extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before an investigation is completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known during such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack 

security breaches including breaches of our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers or clients could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject us to significant liability or loss that may not be 

 16  

the charles schwab corporation 

covered by insurance actions by our regulators damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures 

we also face risk related to external fraud involving the misappropriation and use of clients’ user names passwords or other personal information to gain access to our clients’ financial accounts this could occur from the compromise of clients’ personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company where clients’ personal information is taken and then made available to fraudsters such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties including foreign statesponsored parties losses reimbursed to clients under our guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

technology and operational failures or errors could subject us to losses litigation regulatory actions and reputational damage 

we must process record and monitor a large number of transactions and our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to our systems system interruptions errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes including changes in client use patterns technological failure changes to our systems linkages with thirdparty systems and power failures and can have a significant impact on our business and operations our systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error execution errors errors in models such as those used for asset management capital planning and management risk management stress testing and compliance employee misconduct unauthorized trading external fraud computer viruses distributed denial of service attacks cyber attacks terrorist attacks natural disaster power outage capacity constraints software flaws events impacting key business partners and vendors and similar events for example we and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have in certain circumstances made websites mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time it could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to our technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence which could affect our ability to process and settle client transactions moreover instances of fraud or other misconduct might also negatively impact our reputation and client confidence in the company in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances despite our efforts to identify areas of risk oversee operational areas involving risk and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks there can be no assurance that we will not suffer unexpected losses reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors including those of our vendors or other third parties 

while we devote substantial attention and resources to the reliability capacity and scalability of our systems extraordinary trading volumes such as those that have recently occurred could cause our computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail affecting our ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients’ orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate for example certain of our client service response and processing times have increased as a result of very high levels of client engagement and our clients have experienced and continue to occasionally experience delays accessing our systems during periods when there is an unusually high volume of client activity disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses decreased client satisfaction reputational damage and regulatory inquiries we are also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges clearing houses market makers dealers and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement system failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices and cancelled orders cause substantial losses for us and for our clients and subject us to claims from our clients for damages and cause reputational harm 

  

our investment management operations may subject us to fiduciary or other legal liability for client losses 

fund and trust management and administration are complex activities and include functions such as recordkeeping and accounting security pricing corporate actions compliance with investment restrictions daily net asset value computations account reconciliations and required distributions to fund shareholders failure to properly perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of our services and products could subject us to regulatory sanctions penalties or litigation and result in reputational damage liability to clients and the termination of investment management or administration agreements and the withdrawal of assets under our management 

in the management and administration of funds and client accounts we use quantitative models and other tools and resources to support investment decisions and processes including those related to risk assessment portfolio management trading and hedging activities and product valuations errors in the design function or underlying assumptions used in these 

 17  

the charles schwab corporation 

models and tools particularly if we fail to detect the errors over an extended period could subject us to claims of a breach of fiduciary duty and potentially large liabilities for makewhole payments litigation andor regulatory fines 

we rely on outsourced service providers to perform key functions 

we rely on external service providers to perform certain key technology processing servicing and support functions these service providers face technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information could cause us to incur losses and could harm our reputation an interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints financial difficulties natural disasters public health crises political developments or for any other reason and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in financial losses to us as a result of certain stay at home restrictions related to the covid 19 pandemic we temporarily lost the services from some of our outsourced service providers which contributed to increased client service response and processing times switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations 

we rely on financial intermediaries to execute and settle client orders 

we rely on market makers dealers securities exchanges clearing houses and other financial intermediaries to execute and settle our clients’ orders the unwillingness or inability of any of these parties to perform their usual functions coupled with the unavailability of alternative arrangements could result in our clients’ orders not getting executed or settled this may be due to market volatility uneconomic trading conditions capacity constraints financial constraints system failures unanticipated trading halts invoked by securities exchanges market closures or other reasons our inability to get client orders executed or settled because of the unwillingness or inability of these parties to perform their usual functions could result in client dissatisfaction and reputational harm and expose us to client claims for damages 

liquidity risk 

a significant decrease in our liquidity could negatively affect our business as well as reduce client confidence in us 

maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our business operations including transaction settlement custody requirements and lending commitments among other liquidity needs we meet our liquidity needs primarily from working capital and cash generated by client activity as well as external financing fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances as well as market conditions or changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits may affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs a reduction in our liquidity position could reduce client confidence in us which could result in the transfer of client assets and accounts or could cause us to fail to satisfy our liquidity requirements including the lcr in addition if our brokerdealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to csc which could reduce csc’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt pay dividends on csc’s preferred stock or return capital to common stockholders in addition csc may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries 

factors which may adversely affect our liquidity position include csco and tdac having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances fluctuations in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts a dramatic increase in our lending activities including margin mortgagerelated and personal lending increased capital requirements changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations other regulatory changes or a loss of market or client confidence in us resulting in unanticipated withdrawals of client funds as a member firm of securities and derivatives clearing houses we are required to deposit cash stock andor government securities for margin requirements and to clearing funds the margin requirements may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon the nature and size of clients’ trading activity and market volatility for example as a result of recent market volatility the national securities clearing corporation increased margin requirements for member firms and we were required to deposit additional funds clearing houses could also require additional funds from member firms if a clearing member defaults on its obligations to the clearing house in an amount larger than its own margin and clearing fund deposits 

when available cash is not sufficient for our liquidity needs we may seek external financing during periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets potential sources of external financing could be reduced and borrowing costs could increase although csc csco and tdac maintain committed and uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines and csc has a commercial paper issuance program as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec which can 

 18  

the charles schwab corporation 

be used to sell securities financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets in addition a significant downgrade in the company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets 

credit risk 

we may suffer significant losses from our credit exposures 

our businesses are subject to the risk that a client counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate while we have policies and procedures designed to manage this risk the policies and procedures may not be fully effective our exposure mainly results from margin lending clients’ options and futures trading securities lending mortgage lending pledged asset lending our role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds we sponsor 

when clients purchase securities on margin borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities or trade options or futures we are subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients’ indebtedness abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses especially if there is a lack of liquidity as a result of our td ameritrade acquisition our margin options and futures business has materially increased and market liquidity may represent an increased risk 

we have exposure to credit risk associated with our investments those investments are subject to price fluctuations loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such loss of value has resulted from a credit loss the evaluation of whether a credit loss exists is a matter of judgment which includes the assessment of multiple factors if management determines that a security’s decline in fair value is the result of a credit loss an allowance for credit losses on the security will be recorded and a corresponding loss will be recognized in current earnings even if a decline in fair value of a security is not determined to have resulted from a credit loss if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs we would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time 

  

our bank loans primarily consist of first mortgages helocs and pals increases in delinquency and default rates housing and stock price declines increases in the unemployment rate and other economic factors including from the continuing impact of the covid19 pandemic can result in increases in allowances for credit losses and related credit loss expense as well as write downs on such loans 

heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments can increase our risk of loss examples include 

• large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry 

• mortgage loans and helocs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region and 

• client margins options or futures pledged assets and securities lending activities collateralized by or linked to securities of a single issuer index or industry 

we sponsor a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds although we have no obligation to do so we may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit liquidity or other support to our funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity such support could cause us to take significant charges could reduce our liquidity and in certain situations could with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds result in us having to consolidate one or more funds in our financial statements if we choose not to provide credit liquidity or other support in such a situation we could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected 

risks related to our acquisition of td ameritrade 

we may fail to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the td ameritrade acquisition which could adversely affect the value of our stock 

the success of our td ameritrade acquisition will depend in significant part on our ability to realize the anticipated cost 

 19  

the charles schwab corporation 

savings and other benefits from integrating the businesses of schwab and td ameritrade our ability to realize these anticipated cost savings and other benefits is subject to certain risks if we are not able to successfully combine the businesses of schwab and td ameritrade within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected the combined business may not perform as expected and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected 

it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key schwab or td ameritrade employees the loss of clients the disruption of either company’s or both companies’ ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues higher than expected integration costs and an overall postcompletion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated 

most of the integration planning and execution work is currently being done remotely due to the covid19 pandemic the inability to work inperson and onsite with information technology and management oversight could make some of the integration work more challenging particularly with regard to technology we will need to hire a significant number of technology personnel and contract staff and rely on a number of critical technology vendors in order to complete the integration work relating to technology platforms and systems within the target timeframe in addition we may experience delays in acquiring the technology and infrastructure components needed for the integration due to pandemicrelated supply chain disruptions we also have been experiencing high levels of trading volume which if sustained may require us to increase the capacity in our integration technology buildouts in addition at times the attention of certain members of our management and other resources may be diverted from integration work to critical daytoday business operations we may also encounter challenges integrating td ameritrade technologies into schwab platforms any of these factors could make timely achievement of integration milestones more challenging particularly with regard to technology and systems 

we will continue to incur significant integration costs in connection with the td ameritrade acquisition 

we will continue to incur significant nonrecurring costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans with respect to combining the operations of schwab and td ameritrade including technologyrelated workforce and facilities consolidation costs we continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies’ businesses 

we may have difficulty attracting motivating and retaining executives and other employees following completion of the acquisition 

uncertainty about the effect of the acquisition on schwab and td ameritrade employees may impair our ability to attract retain and motivate personnel employee retention may be particularly challenging during the integration process as employees of schwab and td ameritrade may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined business if employees of schwab or td ameritrade depart the integration of the companies may be more difficult and the combined business may be harmed furthermore we may have to incur significant costs in identifying hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to the businesses of schwab or td ameritrade and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may be adversely affected in addition there could be disruptions to or distractions for the workforce and management associated with integrating employees into schwab 

the td ameritrade acquisition may not be accretive to our earnings per share which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

based on the anticipated synergies between schwab and td ameritrade we expect the acquisition to be accretive to our earnings per share in the third year following completion of the merger however future events and conditions could reduce or delay the accretion that is currently projected or result in the acquisition being dilutive to our earnings per share including adverse changes in market conditions additional transaction and integration related costs and other factors such as the failure to realize some or all of the benefits anticipated in the acquisition any dilution of reduction in or delay of any accretion to our earnings per share could cause the price of shares of our common stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate 

other business risks 

potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on our financial position 

we evaluate potential strategic transactions including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions any such transaction could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows the process of

our industry is highly competitive and characterized by aggressive price competition

we face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees 

the market for qualified personnel in our business is highly competitive at various times different functions and roles are in especially high demand in the market compelling us to pay more to attract talent our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs 

we need to hire a significant number of technology personnel and contract staff to complete the td ameritrade integration work within the target timeframe demand for skilled technology professionals is high and we may experience delays in hiring the appropriate skilled resources 

our stock price has fluctuated historically and may continue to fluctuate 

our stock price can be volatile among the factors that may affect the volatility of our stock price are the following 

• our exposure to changes in interest rates 

• speculation in the investment community or the press about or actual changes in our competitive position organizational structure executive team operations financial condition financial reporting and results expense discipline strategic transactions or progress on achieving the expected benefits from our td ameritrade acquisition 

• the announcement of new products services acquisitions or dispositions by us or our competitors 

• increases or decreases in revenue or earnings changes in earnings estimates by the investment community and variations between estimated financial results and actual financial results and

future sales of csc’s equity securities may adversely affect the market price of csc’s common stock and result in dilution 

csc’s certificate of incorporation authorizes csc’s board of directors among other things to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities without stockholder approval 

csc may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes the issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of csc’s common stock and may adversely affect the market price of csc’s common stock 

our ongoing relationships with td bank and its affiliates could have a negative impact on us 

although our acquisition of td ameritrade was structured such that completion of the merger would not result in csc either i being deemed to be “controlled” by td bank as that term is interpreted by the federal reserve under the bhc act or hola or ii being deemed to be in “control” of any of td bank’s depository institutions changes in circumstances could trigger presumptions of control under the federal reserve’s regulations this could occur if td bank and its affiliates own more than 99 of schwab common stock as interpreted in accordance with the applicable rules of the federal reserve while the stockholder agreement between csc and td bank prohibits td bank and its affiliates from exceeding the 99 threshold it could happen unintentionally this presumption of control could also be triggered if the revenue generated to either us or to any of the td bank depository institutions exceeds a certain percentage the stockholder agreement contains provisions to address such situations 

under the ida agreement we are not permitted to reduce the deposit balances swept to the td depository institutions until june 30 2021 and thereafter only by a set amount during each 12month period subject to certain limitations including only moving ida balances designated as floatingrate obligations and maintaining a minimum ida sweep balance through 2031 the bank deposit account fee revenue that we earn related to the ida agreement may be less than the net interest revenue that we could have earned if the deposit balances were swept to our banking subsidiaries rather than the td depository institutions when we are permitted to reduce the ida balances we can only move the balances to our banking subsidiaries if we have sufficient capital in addition in a low rate environment it is possible that the sweep arrangement fee computation could result in a negative amount that we would be required to pay the td depository institutions resulting in us having an expense rather than revenue

2020 compared to 2019 

throughout the extraordinary macroeconomic environment that persisted during 2020 schwab continued to execute on key strategic initiatives and produced solid financial results the impact of covid19 along with social and political turmoil created an unprecedented combination of personal and macroeconomic challenges for our clients employees and stockholders while working through these challenges we progressed in advancing the company’s strategic goals to drive scale monetization and segmentation in ways that benefit our clients among the company’s key accomplishments in 2020 were the successful completion of the acquisition of td ameritrade and three other strategic acquisitions as discussed below 

the covid19 pandemic’s rapid escalation in early 2020 was accompanied by volatile equity markets and the federal reserve’s further easing of monetary policy as the year progressed government aid packages and vaccine developments helped settle the markets with the sp 500 ® erasing its pandemicrelated losses to finish up 16 for the year throughout 2020 client engagement with the financial markets greatly increased over the prior year as client trading activity reached record levels core net new assets totaled 2819 billion in 2020 representing our third consecutive year of over 200 billion total client assets reached 669 trillion spread across 296 million brokerage accounts up 66 and 140 respectively from yearend 2019 

against this backdrop schwab’s net income totaled 33 billion down 405 million or 11 from 2019 while the company produced diluted eps of 212 representing a decrease of 21 relative to 2019 adjusted diluted eps 1  which excludes acquisition and integrationrelated costs amortization of acquired intangible assets and related income tax effects amounted to 245 in 2020 down 9 from 270 in 2019 

total net revenues reached 117 billion for the year increasing 9 from 2019 during march 2020 the federal reserve acted to support the economy by cutting the fed funds rate from 175 to near zero and announcing significant asset purchase programs mortgage refinancing activity subsequently accelerated and our net interest margin was impacted by both significantly lower interest rates and increased prepayments of mortgagebacked securities held in our investment portfolio strong growth in interestearning assets via client inflows and allocation decisions as well as our acquisitions of td ameritrade and assets of usaaimco helped limit the decrease in net interest revenue to 6 resulting in a fullyear 2020 total of 61 billion 

growing balances in advisory solutions and a rebound in equity markets in 2020 helped drive an 8 increase in asset management and administration fees which totaled 35 billion in 2020 record client trading activity and the addition of td ameritrade in the fourth quarter contributed to an 88 increase in trading revenue which reached 14 billion for the year more than offsetting a fullyear impact of the commission reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of 2019 with the td ameritrade acquisition our fourth quarter 2020 results included bank deposit account fee revenue for the first time which totaled 355 million for the period from october 6 through december 31 2020 

total expenses excluding interest increased 26 in 2020 to 74 billion which included significant costs related to our acquisitions with the completion of four acquisitions during the year acquisition and integrationrelated costs totaled 442 million in 2020 representing a significant increase from the 26 million incurred in 2019 amortization of acquired intangible assets also increased totaling 190 million in 2020 compared with 27 million in 2019 exclusive of these items 1  adjusted total expenses increased 16 from 2019 return on average common stockholders’ equity was 9 in 2020 down from 19 in 2019 return on tangible common equity 1 rotce was 15 in 2020 down from 21 in 2019 the 2020 decreases in both return on average common stockholders’ equity and rotce are due to lower net income as well as significantly higher balances of common equity due to the tda acquisition and higher aoci in 2020 driven by unrealized gains in our afs investment portfolio

throughout 2020 the company maintained its disciplined approach to capital management helping sustain significant balance sheet growth schwab’s consolidated total assets ended 2020 at 549 billion representing growth of 255 billion or 87 from yearend 2019 reflecting both our organic growth as well as the acquisitions of td ameritrade and the assets of usaaimco through offerings in april and december the company issued preferred stock totaling approximately 5 billion in 2020 bringing total preferred stock to approximately 77 billion or approximately 25 of tier 1 capital at december 31 2020 the company’s tier 1 leverage ratio was 63 at december 31 2020 

business and asset acquisitions 

td ameritrade 

effective october 6 2020 the company completed its acquisition of td ameritrade td ameritrade provides securities brokerage services including trade execution clearing services and margin lending through its brokerdealer subsidiaries and futures and foreign exchange trade execution services through its fcm and fdm subsidiary at the time of closing td ameritrade had approximately 16 trillion in client assets and approximately 145 million brokerage accounts in exchange for each share of td ameritrade common stock td ameritrade stockholders received 10837 shares of csc common stock except for td bank and its affiliates which received a portion in nonvoting common stock in connection with the transaction schwab issued approximately 586 million common shares to td ameritrade stockholders consisting of approximately 509 million shares of common stock and 77 million shares of nonvoting common stock upon completion of the acquisition tda holding became a whollyowned subsidiary of csc see item 8 – note 3 for more information 

for the period of october 6 through december 31 2020 total net revenues and total expenses excluding interest attributable to td ameritrade were approximately 17 billion and 943 million respectively td ameritrade’s primary sources of revenues include trading revenue bank deposit account fees net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees bank deposit account fee revenue is primarily earned through the company’s ida agreement td ameritrade’s assets and liabilities have been revalued and recorded at their provisional estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition 

the integration of td ameritrade’s operations is expected to occur over 18 to 36 months from the date of acquisition and the company expects to continue to incur significant acquisition and integrationrelated costs and integrationrelated capital expenditures throughout the integration process such costs have included and are expected to continue to include professional fees such as legal advisory and accounting fees and compensation and benefits expenses for employees and contractors involved in the integration work costs for technology enhancements as well as exit and other related costs incurred to attain anticipated synergies such costs include employee compensation and benefits including severance pay other termination benefits and retention costs as well as costs related to facility closures including accelerated depreciation or impairments of assets in those locations 

the company currently estimates that total acquisition and integrationrelated costs and capital expenditures related to the integration of td ameritrade will be approximately 16 billion the company is in the early stages of integration and our estimates of the nature amounts and timing of recognition of acquisition and integrationrelated costs are subject to change based on a number of factors including the expected duration and complexity of the integration process and the heightened uncertainty of the current economic environment more specifically factors that could cause variability in our expected acquisition and integrationrelated costs include the level of employee attrition workforce redeployment from eliminated positions into open roles changes in the levels of client activity as well as increased real estaterelated exit cost variability due to effects of the covid19 pandemic 

acquisition and integrationrelated costs which includes related exit costs for all of our acquisitions completed in 2020 totaled 442 million and the company expects to incur a roughly consistent amount in 2021 related primarily to continued work on the integration of td ameritrade while inclusion of td ameritrade’s operating costs and continued acquisition and integrationrelated costs will increase the company’s total expenses excluding interest in 2021 and going forward we expect to realize cost synergies through integration over the course of the integration we expect to realize annualized cost synergies of between 18 billion and 20 billion with onequarter to onethird on an annualized runrate basis expected by the end of the first year following acquisition estimated timing and amounts of synergy realization are subject to change as we progress in the integration see also results of operations – total expenses excluding interest nongaap financial measures and item 8 – notes 3 and 16

against the backdrop of the more challenging than expected macroeconomic environment and our own pricing decisions schwab’s net income totaled 37 billion in 2019 an increase of 197 million or 6 diluted eps grew to 267 representing an increase of 9 from 2018 

total net revenues reached 107 billion up 6 in 2019 net interest revenue increased 12 in 2019 to 65 billion driven by higher average investment yields and also by an increase in client cash balances held at our bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries while trading revenue declined 17 to 752 million due to our pricing actions asset management and administration fees remained essentially flat with 2018 at 32 billion decreasing 1 growing enrollment in advice solutions along with rising balances in other thirdparty mutual funds helped to largely offset declines in mutual fund onesource ® and lower sweep money market fund revenue due to transfers of sweep money market funds to our balance sheet in 2018 and early 2019 

total expenses excluding interest increased 5 in 2019 to 59 billion which included 62 million in severance charges associated with a 3 reduction in our workforce and 25 million in costs relating to the announced acquisitions of assets of usaaimco and td ameritrade the company’s focus on driving efficiency while managing spending in a disciplined manner helped us maintain a ratio of expenses to client assets of 16 bps for 2019 balancing longterm profitability with reinvesting for growth we achieved a 452 pretax profit margin and a 19 return on equity in 2019 representing our second consecutive year of at least 45 and 19 respectively

total net revenues 

total net revenues of 117 billion and 107 billion for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively represented growth of 9 and 6 from the prior periods the 2020 increase was due to our acquisition of td ameritrade which contributed approximately 17 billion of total net revenues from october 6 through december 31 2020 total net revenues increased in 2019 primarily due to growth in net interest revenue

net interest revenue 

schwab’s primary interestearning assets include cash and cash equivalents cash and investments segregated margin loans which constitute the majority of receivables from brokerage clients investment securities and bank loans revenue on interestearning assets is affected by various factors such as the composition of assets prevailing interest rates and spreads at the time of origination or purchase changes in interest rates on floating rate securities and loans and changes in prepayment levels for mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities and loans fees earned and expenses incurred on securities lending and borrowing activities are conducted by our brokerdealer subsidiaries using assets held in client brokerage accounts 

schwab’s interestbearing liabilities include bank deposits payables to brokerage clients shortterm borrowings eg federal home loan bank fhlb advances commercial paper and longterm debt noninterestbearing funding sources include stockholders’ equity certain client cash balances and other miscellaneous liabilities

tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted 

schwab establishes the rates paid on clientrelated liabilities and management expects that it will generally adjust the rates paid on these liabilities at some fraction of any movement in shortterm rates schwab deploys the funds from these sources into the assets outlined above we do not use shortterm wholesale borrowings to support our longterm investment activity but may use such funding including fhlb advances or commercial paper for shortterm liquidity purposes or to provide temporary funding eg for investment purchases ahead of anticipated balance sheet deposit growth 

in order to keep interestrate sensitivity within established limits management actively monitors and adjusts interestrate sensitivity through changes in the balance sheet primarily by adjusting the composition of our banking subsidiaries’ investment portfolios as schwab builds its client base we attract new client sweep cash which is a primary driver of funding balance sheet growth 

late in the first quarter of 2020 the federal reserve cut the federal funds target overnight rate from 175 to near zero on the longerend of the curve the 10year treasury rate declined by over 120 basis points lower interest rates across maturities persisted from the end of the first quarter through the end of 2020 while credit spreads also compressed moreover changes in the economic environment throughout 2020 resulting from the covid19 pandemic drove significantly higher levels of client cash sweep balances as these balances rapidly accumulated in the first quarter of 2020 the company initially placed a substantial amount in excess reserves held at the federal reserve and subsequently deployed a significant amount of this cash buildup throughout 2020 afs securities purchases in 2020 totaled 2022 billion these purchases were made at rates below the average yield on the existing afs portfolio due to the current low interest rate environment 

schwab’s acquisition of td ameritrade effective october 6 2020 provides additional interestearning assets and liabilities for schwab’s 2020 fullyear averages td ameritrade contributed approximately 120 billion of average interestearning assets and 96 billion of average interestbearing liabilities td ameritrade’s interestearning assets consist primarily of receivables from brokerage clients cash and investments segregated cash and cash equivalents and afs securities td ameritrade’s interestbearing liabilities consist primarily of payables to brokerage clients and longterm debt see item 8 – note 3 for additional information on the td ameritrade acquisition including the provisional fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed

5 interest revenue or expense was less than 500 thousand in the period or periods presented 

net interest revenue decreased 403 million or 6 in 2020 from 2019 due primarily to lower average investment yields partially offset by growth in interestearning assets accelerated premium amortization on debt securities in 2020 also contributed to the reduction in net interest revenue as the decline in longterm interest rates in 2020 resulted in higher prepayments of mortgagerelated debt securities td ameritrade contributed approximately 443 million of net interest revenue from october 6 through december 31 2020 

average interestearning assets for 2020 were higher by 40 compared to 2019 this increase in average interestearning assets was primarily driven by higher client cash balances in bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients due to higher client cash allocations and our acquisitions of td ameritrade and assets of usaaimco 

our net interest margin decreased to 162 in 2020 from 241 in 2019 this decrease was driven primarily by lower yields received on interestearning assets due largely to the federal reserve’s 2019 and 2020 interest rate reductions as well as higher premium amortization on mortgagerelated debt securities due to the low interest rate environment purchases of investment securities in 2020 were made at rates below the average yield on the existing afs portfolio which negatively impacted our net interest margin the amount of any further net interest margin compression and resulting net interest

revenue is dependent on a number of factors including changes to libor premium amortization reinvestment rates and growth in client cash balances 

net interest revenue increased 693 million or 12 in 2019 from 2018 due to higher average investment yields and growth in interest earning assets our net interest margin improved 12 basis points to 241 in 2019 from 2018 driven primarily by higher average yields received on interestearning assets in 2019 due largely to the net impact of the federal reserve’s interest rate increases in 2018 and decreases in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 the increase in average yields on interestearning assets was partially offset by higher average interest rates paid on bank deposits and other interestbearing liabilities portfolio adjustments made in 2019 to hold a higher percentage of fixedrate longer duration investments helped to moderate the impact of the declining rate environment on our net interest margin 

average interestearning assets grew 6 from 2018 to 2019 primarily driven by higher bank deposits due to transfers from sweep money market funds to bank sweep as well as higher client cash balances 

asset management and administration fees

asset management and administration fees decreased by 18 million or 1 in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to lower sweep money market fund revenue as a result of transfers to bank and brokerdealer sweep in 2018 and early 2019 as well as client asset allocation choices including reduced usage of mutual fund onesource ®  part of the decline was offset by revenue from growing asset balances in purchased money market funds other thirdparty mutual funds and etfs and in advice solutions

total compensation and benefits increased in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to an overall increase in employee headcount due primarily to the addition of approximately 10000 td ameritrade employees and the hiring of 400 former usaa employees in connection with our 2020 acquisitions the increase in 2020 also reflected the company’s payment of 1000 to all nonofficer employees in march 2020 to help them cover costs incurred due to the covid19 pandemic compensation and benefits in 2020 included 235 million of acquisition and integrationrelated costs the increase in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to both an overall increase in employee headcount to support our expanding client base and higher severance costs which included 62 million associated with a 3 reduction in our workforce in the third quarter of 2019 

professional services expense increased in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to acquisition and integrationrelated costs in 2020 of 158 million the increase in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to overall growth in the business investments in projects to further drive efficiency and scale and certain costs relating to the pending acquisitions completed in 2020 

occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2020 from 2019 primarily due the inclusion of tda’s results of operations from october 6 2020 forward as well as an increase in technology equipment costs associated with higher client trade volumes and overall growth in the business the increase in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to increases in software maintenance expenses and additional licenses to support growth in the business 

communications expense increased in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to the inclusion of tda’s results of operations from october 6 2020 forward and higher news and quotation services expenses due to higher trade volumes 

depreciation and amortization expenses grew in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software higher depreciation and amortization of equipment office facilities and property recognized in the tda acquisition as well as higher depreciation of buildings and equipment related to the expansion of our us campuses in 2019 and 2020 the increase in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to higher amortization of internally developed software associated with investments in software and technology enhancements 

amortization of acquired intangible assets increased in 2020 as a result of the acquisitions completed during the year 

regulatory fees and assessments increased in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to the inclusion of tda’s results of operations from october 6 2020 forward and higher fdic insurance assessments and other regulatory assessments due to growth in assets and overall growth of the business in 2020 regulatory fees and assessments decreased in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to a decrease in fdic insurance assessments resulting from the elimination of the fdic surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018 

other expenses increased in 2020 from 2019 primarily resulting from the inclusion of tda’s results of operations from october 6 2020 forward and increases in processing fees and related expenses due to higher client trade volumes and market volatility these increases were partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expense in 2020 other expenses in 2020 included acquisition and integrationrelated costs of 30 million other expenses decreased in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to lower travel and entertainment expense and bad debt expense 

capital expenditures were 741 million 753 million and 576 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively capital expenditures decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower building expansion in 2020 largely offset by higher capitalized software costs capital expenditures increased in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to the expansion of our campuses in the us investments in buildings were 173 million 397 million and 253 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively capitalized software costs totaled 453 million 188 million and 194 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively

along with a limited number of issues in utilizing our website and mobile applications in 2021 the company anticipates increased spending to improve service levels and support our expanding client base including additional technology spending as well as hiring more client service professionals 

overall in 2021 we expect total expenses excluding interest to reflect the impacts of continued acquisition and integrationrelated costs primarily related to our integration of td ameritrade increased spending to improve service levels and support growth and our progress in achieving incremental cost synergies the magnitude and timing of these impacts are inherently uncertain and depend on a number of factors including but not limited to the level of client engagement and trading volumes the pace and levels of employee hiring onboarding and attrition and changes in our needs to exit or maintain office and branch locations 

taxes on income 

schwab’s effective income tax rate on income before taxes was 233 in 2020 236 in 2019 and 231 in 2018 the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to federal and state tax benefits recognized during 2020 including settlement of the irs examination of tax years 20112014 the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain federal and state uncertain tax positions and tax benefits realized from the filing of state tax returns as well as an increase in lowincome housing tax credit lihtc benefits offsetting the decrease in the effective tax rate from these items was an increase in nondeductible acquisition costs and fdic insurance premium disallowance as well as a decrease in equity compensation tax deduction benefits the change in rates in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in equity compensation tax deduction benefits which reduced our tax expense by approximately 23 million and 46 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively 

segment information 

schwab provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments – investor services and advisor services the investor services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors and retirement plan services as well as other corporate brokerage services to businesses and their employees the advisor services segment provides custodial trading banking and support services as well as retirement business services to independent rias independent retirement advisors and recordkeepers revenues and expenses are attributed to the two segments based on which segment services the client management evaluates the performance of the segments on a pretax basis segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments net revenues in both segments are generated from the underlying client assets and trading activity differences in the composition of net revenues between the segments are based on the composition of client assets client trading frequency and pricing unique to each while both segments leverage the scale and efficiency of our platforms segment expenses reflect the dynamics of serving millions of clients in investor services versus the thousands of rias on the advisor services platform 

the company integrated its business and asset acquisitions during 2020 into its two existing reportable segments revenues and expenses from our acquisition of usaaimco are allocated to investor services only revenues and expenses from td ameritrade and our other 2020 acquisitions are attributed to both investor services and advisor services based on which segment services the client see item 8 – note 3 for more information regarding acquisitions

acquisition and integrationrelated costs compensation and benefits increased in both segments primarily due to the acquisition of tda and overall headcount growth to support our expanding client base with investor services increasing more significantly due to greater headcount growth from the tda acquisition and the hiring of approximately 400 former usaa employees in connection with the usaaimco acquisition both segments also saw increases in professional services depreciation and amortization amortization of acquired intangible assets and other expenses primarily due to the inclusion of tda’s expenses from october 6 2020 forward as well as acquisition and integrationrelated costs with investor services’ expenses increasing more significantly due to overall size of the segment’s client base and greater client base growth from tda 

investor services and advisor services expenses excluding interest increased 3 and 12 respectively in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits and occupancy and equipment expense additionally advisor services had higher professional services expense due to overall growth in the business and investments in projects to further drive efficiency and scale and investor services had higher amortization of internally developed software due to technology enhancements for both segments these increases were partially offset by a decrease in fdic insurance assessments due to the elimination of the fdic surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018 and lower travel and entertainment expenses

risk governance 

senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying measuring and controlling risks 

the global risk committee which is comprised of senior executives from each major business and control function is responsible for the oversight of risk management this includes identifying emerging risks assessing risk management practices and the control environment reinforcing business accountability for risk management supervisory controls and regulatory compliance supporting resource prioritization across the organization and escalating significant issues to the board of directors

we have established risk metrics and reporting that enable measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite the risk metrics with risk limits and tolerance levels are established for key risk categories by the global risk committee and its functional risk subcommittees 

the chief risk officer regularly reports activities of the global risk committee to the risk committee of the board of directors the board risk committee in turn assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to our risk management program including approving risk appetite statements and related key risk appetite metrics and reviewing reports relating to risk issues from functional areas of corporate risk management legal compliance and internal audit 

functional risk subcommittees focusing on specific areas of risk report to the global risk committee these subcommittees include the 

• operational risk oversight committee – provides oversight of and approves operational risk management policies risk tolerance levels and operational risk governance processes and includes subcommittees covering information security fraud thirdparty risk data and model governance 

• compliance risk committee – provides oversight of compliance risk management programs and policies providing an aggregate view of compliance risk exposure and employee conduct including subcommittees covering fiduciary and conflicts of interest risk and international compliance risk 

• financial risk oversight committee – provides oversight of and approves credit market liquidity and capital risk policies limits and exposures and 

• new products and services risk oversight committee – provides oversight of and approves corporate policy and procedures relating to the risk governance of new products and services 

senior management has also created an incentive compensation risk oversight committee which establishes policy and reviews and approves the annual risk assessment of incentive compensation plans and reports directly to the compensation committee of the board of directors 

the company’s compliance finance internal audit legal and corporate risk management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating testing and monitoring risk management 

in addition the disclosure committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter the disclosure committee reports on this evaluation to the ceo and cfo prior to their certification required by sections 302 and 906 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 

operational risk 

operational risk arises due to potential inadequacies or failures related to people internal processes and systems or from external events or relationships impacting the company andor any of its key business partners and third parties while operational risk is inherent in all business activities we rely on a system of internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep operational risk and operational losses within the company’s risk appetite we have specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk and use control testing programs and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls where appropriate we manage the impact of operational loss and litigation expense through the purchase of insurance the insurance program is specifically designed to address our key operational risks and to maintain compliance with local laws and regulation 

schwab’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of our critical business functions and technology systems to the extent schwab experiences business or system interruptions errors or downtime which could result from a variety of causes including natural disasters terrorist attacks technological failure cyber attacks changes to systems linkages with thirdparty systems and power failures our business and operations could be negatively impacted to minimize business interruptions and ensure the capacity to continue operations during an incident regardless of duration schwab maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure which includes facilities for backup and communications a geographically dispersed workforce and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans and a wellestablished incident management program

credit risk 

credit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower counterparty or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations our exposure to credit risk mainly results from investing activities in our liquidity and investment portfolios mortgage lending margin lending and client option and futures activities pledged asset lending securities lending activities and our role as a counterparty in other financial contracts to manage the risks of such losses we have established policies and procedures which include setting and reviewing credit limits monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties and adjusting margin pal option and futures requirements for certain securities and instruments 

liquidity and investment portfolios 

schwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios which include us agency and nonagency mortgagebacked securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities us agency notes us treasury securities certificates of deposit us state and municipal securities commercial paper and foreign government agency securities 

at december 31 2020 substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade us agency mortgagebacked securities do not have explicit credit ratings however management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the us government or us governmentsponsored enterprises 

mortgage lending portfolio 

the bank loan portfolio includes first mortgages helocs and other loans the credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews management regularly reviews asset quality including concentrations delinquencies nonaccrual loans chargeoffs and recoveries all are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses 

our residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum ltv ratios cash out limits and minimum fair isaac corporation fico credit scores the specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan for example whether the property is a primary or secondary residence whether the loan is for investment property whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo 

schwab does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a fico score of less than 620 at origination unless the borrower has compensating credit factors for more information on credit quality indicators relating to schwab’s bank loans see item 8 – note 7

other counterparty exposures 

schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations mutual funds and other financial institutions even if schwab’s clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to the company 

market risk 

market risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or market conditions schwab is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on our interestearning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets 

to manage interest rate risk we have established policies and procedures which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity risk to remain within these limits we manage the maturity repricing and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios management monitors established guidelines to stay within the company’s risk appetite 

our measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and as a result cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue bank deposit account fees or economic value of equity eve actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies including changes in asset and liability mix financial instruments are also subject to the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument 

we are indirectly exposed to option futures and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers and client securities loaned out as part of the brokerage securities lending activities equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity margin borrowing and overall client engagement with schwab additionally we earn mutual fund and etf service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue we earn 

our market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material 

interest rate risk simulations 

net interest revenue simulation 

for our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulations include all balance sheet interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments repricing of financial instruments and reinvestment of matured or paiddown securities and loans 

net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets include investment securities margin loans and bank loans these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans and control the composition of our investment securities we have some ability to manage our net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions 

net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted 

the following table shows the simulated change to net interest revenue over the next 12 months beginning december 31 2020 and 2019 of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period 



the change in sensitivities of net interest revenue as of december 31 2020 reflects a significantly lower interest rate curve relative to december 31 2019 due to the global economic impact from the covid19 pandemic higher shortterm interest rates would positively impact net interest revenue as yields on interestearning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources a decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the company’s investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources compressing net interest margin 

in addition to measuring the effect of a gradual 100 basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel and nonparallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue 

economic value of equity simulation 

management also uses eve simulations to measure interest rate risk eve sensitivity measures the longterm impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment key assumptions in our eve calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments term structure models of interest rates nonmaturity deposit behavior and pricing assumptions our net interest revenue and eve simulations reflect the assumption of nonnegative investment yields 

bank deposit account fees simulations 

consistent with the presentation on our statement of income the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the interest rate sensitivity analysis described above as of december 31 2020 the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to changes in interest rates is limited as a significant portion of bda deposit balances are allocated to fixedrate obligation amounts 

expected phaseout of libor 

the company has established a firmwide team to address the phasingout of libor by june 30 2023 as part of our efforts we have assessed our libor exposures the largest of which are certain investment securities and loans in purchasing new investment securities we ensure that appropriate fallback language is in the security’s prospectus in the event that libor is unavailable or deemed unreliable and we have sold certain securities lacking appropriate fallback language we are updating loan agreements to ensure new liborbased loans adequately provide for an alternative to libor furthermore we plan to phaseout the use of libor as a reference rate in our new lending products before the end of december 2021 per guidance from the federal reserve board consistent with our “through clients’ eyes” strategy our focus throughout the libor transition process is to ensure clients are treated fairly and consistently as this major change is occurring in the financial markets 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the potential that schwab will be unable to sell assets or meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses 

due to its role as a source of financial strength csc’s liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of csco td ameritrade inc and tdac our principal brokerdealer subsidiaries the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries principal and interest due on corporate debt dividend payments on csc’s preferred stock and returns of

tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted 

capital to common stockholders the liquidity needs of our brokerdealer subsidiaries are primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin borrowing activities and capital expenditures the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries are primarily driven by the amount of client deposits in addition the liquidity needs of our banking subsidiaries can also be met by excess reserves held at the federal reserve sales of investment securities or fhlb borrowings we have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions we seek to maintain client confidence in the balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the company to meet its obligations to this end we have established limits and contingency funding scenarios to support liquidity levels during both business as usual and stressed conditions 

we employ a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity we conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during marketrelated or companyspecific liquidity stress events liquidity is also tested at certain subsidiaries and results are reported to the financial risk oversight committee a number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the organization and are reviewed with management as appropriate 

primary funding sources 

schwab’s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts these funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients 

other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations maturities and sales of investment securities repayments on loans securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts bank deposit account fees earned on client deposits placed in thirdparty depository programs repurchase agreements and cash provided by external financing 

to meet daily funding needs we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and shortterm investments for unanticipated liquidity needs we also maintain a buffer of highly liquid investments including us treasury securities 

additional funding sources 

in addition to internal sources of liquidity schwab has access to external funding the need for shortterm borrowings from external debt facilities arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements scheduled liquidation of interestearning investments movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements and general corporate purposes we maintain policies and procedures necessary to access funding and test discount window borrowing procedures on a periodic basis

the following table describes external debt facilities available at december 31 2020 



1 amounts available are dependent on the amount of first mortgages helocs and the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral 

2 amounts available are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral 

3 csc has authorization from its board of directors to issue commercial paper notes not to exceed 15 billion in february 2021 the company increased the amount available to 15 billion 

4 other than an overnight borrowing to test availability this facility was unused during 2020 

5 effective october 6 2020 schwab entered into a guaranty supplement to guarantee the obligations of td ameritrade under this credit agreement the provision of the guaranty supplement was a condition for certain financial covenant and reporting obligations being modified in the credit agreement the company terminated this revolving credit facility effective january 28 2021 

6 secured borrowing is made available based on tdac’s ability to provide acceptable collateral to the lender as determined by the credit agreement 

our banking subsidiaries maintain secured credit facilities with the fhlb amounts available under these facilities are dependent on the value of our first mortgages helocs and the fair value of certain of our investment securities that are pledged as collateral these credit facilities are also available as backup financing in the event the outflow of client cash from the banking subsidiaries’ respective balance sheets is greater than maturities and paydowns on investment securities and bank loans 

our banking subsidiaries also have access to shortterm secured funding through the federal reserve discount window amounts available under the federal reserve discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral 

csc has a commercial paper program of which proceeds are used for general corporate purposes the maturities of the commercial paper notes may vary but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue csc’s ratings for these shortterm borrowings were p1 by moody’s a1 by standard  poor’s and f1 by fitch at december 31 2020 and 2019 and csc had no commercial paper notes outstanding at december 31 2020 or 2019 

the financial covenants for the 700 million committed credit facility require csco to maintain a minimum net capital ratio all bank subsidiaries to be well capitalized and csc to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity adjusted to exclude aoci at december 31 2020 the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was 165 billion csc’s stockholders’ equity excluding aoci at december 31 2020 was 507 billion management believes these restrictions will not have a material effect on csc’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements 

the financial covenants for the 300 million tda holding revolving credit facility requires csc to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity adjusted to exclude aoci at december 31 2020 the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was 309 billion csc’s stockholders’ equity excluding aoci at december 31 2020 was 507 billion effective january 28 2021 the company terminated the tda holding revolving credit facility 

to partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the options clearing corporation csco has unsecured standby letter of credit agreements locs with several banks in favor of the options clearing corporation which totaled 15 million at december 31 2020 there were no funds drawn under any of these locs during 2020 or 2019 in connection with its securities lending activities the company is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients these collateral requirements are satisfied by providing cash as collateral 

csc has a universal automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec which enables it to issue debt equity and other securities

internal guidelines are set for both csc and its regulated subsidiaries to ensure capital levels are in line with our strategy and regulatory requirements capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at assetliability management and pricing committee and financial risk oversight committee meetings a number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify potential problems that could impact capital in addition we monitor the subsidiaries’ capital levels and requirements subject to regulatory capital requirements and any required approvals any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to csc in the form of dividends and returns of capital when subsidiaries have need of additional capital funds are provided by csc as equity investments and also as subordinated loans in a form approved as regulatory capital by regulators for csco the details and method used for each cash infusion are based on an analysis of the particular entity’s needs and financing alternatives the amounts and structure of infusions must take into consideration maintenance of regulatory capital requirements debtequity ratios and equity double leverage ratios 

schwab conducts regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various adverse macroeconomic and companyspecific events to which the company could be subjected the objective of the capital stress testing is 1 to explore various potential outcomes – including rare and extreme events and 2 to assess impacts of potential stressful outcomes on both capital and liquidity additionally we have a comprehensive capital contingency plan to provide action plans for certain low probabilityhigh impact capital events that the company might face the capital contingency plan is issued under the authority of the financial risk oversight committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events it does not specifically address every contingency but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress the results of the stress testing indicate there are two scenarios which could stress the company’s capital 1 inflows of balance sheet cash during a period of very low interest rates and 2 outflows of balance sheet cash when other sources of financing are not available and the company is required to sell assets to fund the flows at a loss the capital contingency plan is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate

regulatory capital requirements 

csc is subject to capital requirements set by the federal reserve and is required to serve as a source of strength for our banking subsidiaries and to provide financial assistance if our banking subsidiaries experience financial distress schwab is required to maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio for csc of at least 4 and we have a longterm operating objective of 675700 due to the relatively low risk of our balance sheet assets and riskbased capital ratios at csc and csb that are well in excess of regulatory requirements the tier 1 leverage ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on csc’s asset growth 

our banking subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements set by their regulators that are substantially similar to those imposed on csc by the federal reserve our banking subsidiaries’ failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that could have a direct material effect on the banks schwab’s principal banking subsidiary csb is required to maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 to be well capitalized but seeks to maintain a ratio of at least 625 based on its regulatory capital ratios at december 31 2020 csb is considered well capitalized 

as a result of the significant inflow of client cash in 2020 our tier 1 leverage ratios for csc and csb declined from 73 and 71 respectively at yearend 2019 to 63 and 55 respectively at december 31 2020 though below our longterm operating objectives these ratios are well above the regulatory minimum for both csc and csb the pace of our return to the longterm operating objectives over time depends on a number of factors including the overall size of the company’s balance sheet earnings and capital issuances and deployment

fair value of financial instruments 

schwab uses the market approach to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value and to determine fair value disclosures see item 8 – notes 2 and 18 for more information on our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 

when available schwab uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities quoted prices for investments in exchangetraded securities represent endofday close prices published by exchanges quoted prices for money market funds and other mutual funds represent reported net asset values when utilizing market data and bidask spread we use the price within the bidask spread that best represents fair value when quoted prices in active markets do not exist prices are obtained from independent thirdparty pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets we generally obtain prices from three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value our primary thirdparty pricing service provides prices for our fixed income investments such as commercial paper certificates of deposits us government and agency securities state and municipal securities corporate debt securities assetbacked securities foreign government agency securities and nonagency commercial mortgagebacked securities such prices are based on observable trades brokerdealer quotes and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads and weightedaverage maturity for the same or similar “tobeissued” securities we compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent thirdparty pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded at december 31 2020 and 2019 we did not adjust prices received from the primary independent thirdparty pricing service 

critical accounting estimates 

the consolidated financial statements of schwab have been prepared in accordance with gaap item 8 – note 2 contains more information on our significant accounting policies made in applying these accounting principles 

while the majority of the revenues expenses assets and liabilities are not based on estimates there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on schwab’s financial position and financial results these critical accounting estimates are described below management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy 

management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors additionally management has reviewed with the audit committee the company’s significant estimates discussed in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

income taxes 

schwab estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate including federal state and local domestic jurisdictions and immaterial amounts owed to several foreign jurisdictions the estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statements of income in taxes on income accrued taxes are reported in other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes deferred tax assets are recognized if in management’s judgment their realizability is determined to be more likely than not uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize an uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement in estimating accrued taxes we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances 

 59  

the charles schwab corporation 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted 

changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates interpretations of tax laws the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities and newly enacted statutory judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions these changes when they occur affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the operating results of the company see item 8 – note 22 for more information on the company’s income taxes 

legal and regulatory reserves 

reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter after considering among other factors the progress of the case prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases available defenses and the opinions and views of legal counsel in many cases including most class action lawsuits it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred or to estimate the range of that loss until the matter is close to resolution in which case no accrual is made until that time reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved see item 8 – note 15 for more information on the company’s contingencies related to legal and regulatory reserves 

business combinations 

we have accounted for our acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date as we allocate the purchase price to the estimated fair values of acquired tangible and intangible assets and the liabilities assumed we also use our best estimates to determine the useful lives of the tangible and definitelived intangible assets which impact the periods over which depreciation and amortization of those assets are recognized these best estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain as they pertain to forward looking views of our businesses client behavior and market conditions in our acquisitions we have also recognized goodwill at the amount by which the purchase price paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired see item 8 – note 3 for more information on our valuation methods and the results of applying the acquisition method of accounting including the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and where relevant the estimated remaining useful lives 

our ongoing accounting for goodwill and the tangible and intangible assets acquired requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions as we exercise judgement to evaluate these assets for impairment our processes and accounting policies for evaluating impairments are further described in item 8 – note 2 one of our reporting units has an immaterial amount of goodwill the results of the 2020 annual goodwill impairment testing for our other two reporting units indicated that the estimated fair values substantially exceeded their carrying amounts 

nongaap financial measures 

in addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with gaap management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain references to the nongaap financial measures described below we believe these nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information about the financial performance of the company and facilitate meaningful comparison of schwab’s results in the current period to both historic and future results these nongaap measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to nongaap financial measures presented by other companies

schwab’s use of nongaap measures is reflective of certain adjustments made to gaap financial measures as described below 



beginning in 2021 the company also uses adjusted diluted eps and return on tangible common equity as components of performance criteria for employee bonus and certain executive management incentive compensation arrangements the compensation committee of csc’s board of directors maintains discretion in evaluating performance against these criteria 

the following tables present reconciliations of gaap measures to nongaap measures

business strategy and competitive environment 

schwab was founded on the belief that all americans deserve access to a better investing experience although much has changed in the intervening years our purpose remains clear – to champion every client’s goals with passion and integrity guided by this purpose and our vision of creating the most trusted leader in investment services management has adopted a strategy described as “through clients’ eyes” 

this strategy emphasizes placing clients’ perspectives needs and desires at the forefront because investing plays a fundamental role in building financial security we strive to deliver a better investing experience for our clients – individual investors and the people and institutions who serve them – by disrupting longstanding industry practices on their behalf and providing superior service we also aim to offer a broad range of products and solutions to meet client needs with a focus on transparency value and trust in addition management works to couple schwab’s scale and resources with ongoing expense discipline to keep costs low and ensure that products and solutions are affordable as well as responsive to client needs in combination these are the key elements of our “no tradeoffs” approach to serving investors we believe that following this strategy is the best way to maximize our market valuation and stockholder returns over time 

management estimates that investable wealth in the united states us consisting of assets in defined contribution retail wealth management and brokerage and registered investment advisor channels along with bank deposits currently exceeds 45 trillion which means the company’s 404 trillion in client assets leaves substantial opportunity for growth our strategy is based on the principle that developing trusted relationships will translate into more assets from both new and existing clients ultimately driving more revenue and along with expense discipline and thoughtful capital management will generate earnings growth and build longterm stockholder value 

within investor services our competition in serving individual investors spans brokerage wealth management and asset management firms as well as banks and trust companies in the advisor services arena we compete with institutional custodians traditional and discount brokers banks and trust companies 

across both segments our key competitive advantages are

the charles schwab corporation 

 

sources of net revenues 

our three largest sources of net revenues are net interest revenue asset management and administration fees and trading revenue these revenue streams are supported by the combination of bank brokerdealer and asset management operating subsidiaries each of which brings specific capabilities that enable us to provide clients with the products and services they are looking for 

net interest revenue is the difference between interest generated on interestearning assets and interest paid on funding sources the majority of which is derived from client cash balances awaiting investment held by schwab as part of clients’ overall relationship with the company while certain of these client cash balances are held on csco’s balance sheet or swept to our money market funds a substantial amount of existing balances – and most new inflows of cash awaiting investment – are swept to our banking subsidiaries interestearning assets are primarily comprised of highquality fixed income securities margin loans and bank loans 

the majority of asset management and administration fees are earned from proprietary money market mutual funds proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds and exchangetraded funds etfs and feebased advisory solutions 

trading revenue includes commissions earned for executing trades for clients in individual equities options futures fixed income securities and certain thirdparty mutual funds and etfs as well as principal transaction revenue earned primarily from actions to support client trading in fixed income securities effective october 7 2019 csco eliminated online trading commissions for us and canadianlisted stocks and etfs as well as the base charge on options these pricing reductions are consistent with our vision of making investing accessible to all management believes they enhance both our value proposition and our competitive positioning and will contribute to longterm growth in total client assets and client accounts at schwab thereby helping build longterm stockholder value

regulation 

as a participant in the securities banking and financial services industries schwab is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws by governmental agencies supervisory authorities and selfregulatory organizations sros we are also subject to oversight by regulatory bodies in other countries in which we operate these regulations affect our business operations and impose capital client protection and market conduct requirements 

holding company and bank regulation 

csc is a savings and loan holding company and is regulated supervised and examined by the federal reserve csc’s principal depository institution subsidiary csb is a federal savings bank and is regulated supervised and examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic csc and csb are also subject to regulation and various requirements and restrictions under state and other federal laws 

this regulatory framework is designed to protect depositors and consumers the safety and soundness of depository institutions and their holding companies and the stability of the banking system as a whole this framework affects the activities and investments of csc and its subsidiaries and gives the regulatory authorities broad discretion in connection with their supervisory examination and enforcement activities and policies below is a discussion of significant regulations also see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – current regulatory environment and other developments” for information regarding significant proposed rulemaking related to our regulation 

regulatory capital and liquidity framework 

banking organizations are subject to the regulatory capital rules issued by the federal reserve and other us banking regulators including the occ and the fdic in addition to minimum riskbased capital requirements banking organizations

the charles schwab corporation 

must hold additional capital referred to as a capital conservation buffer to avoid being subject to limits on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers 

during 2019 depository institutions and their holding companies with consolidated total assets of 250 billion or more or total onbalancesheet foreign exposure of 10 billion or more were required to calculate their regulatory capital and riskweighted assets using both a “standardized approach” and an “advanced approaches” framework and to satisfy the minimum capital requirements under both approaches such companies were also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of at least 30 include accumulated other comprehensive income aoci in their calculation of their capital ratios were subject to an incremental capital buffer of up to 25 of common equity tier 1 capital if imposed by the banking agencies referred to as the countercyclical capital buffer and were subject to certain other enhanced provisions including additional reporting requirements the federal reserve occ and fdic all granted extensions and exemptions to csc and its banking subsidiaries such that they would not be subject to the advanced approaches framework until june 30 2020 as a result of crossing the 250 billion threshold in 2018 csc and its banking subsidiaries in 2019 became subject to all other advanced approaches requirements – the supplementary leverage ratio the inclusion of aoci in the calculation of capital ratios and the countercyclical capital buffer 

the full liquidity coverage ratio lcr rule required banking organizations with consolidated total assets of 250 billion or more or total onbalancesheet foreign exposure of 10 billion or more and their depository institution subsidiaries with 10 billion or more in total consolidated assets to hold high quality liquid assets hqla in an amount equal to at least 100 of their projected net cash outflows over a prospective 30calendarday period of acute liquidity stress calculated on each business day csc became subject to the full lcr rule in the second quarter of 2019 but until the beginning of 2020 was only required to calculate and comply with its lcr requirement as of the last business day of each calendar month 

in october 2019 the federal reserve occ and fdic jointly adopted a final rule which became effective on december 31 2019 interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules that revised the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements for large us banking organizations with 100 billion or more in total consolidated assets the rules established four riskbased categories for determining the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to these institutions based on their total assets crossjurisdictional activity weighted shortterm wholesale funding nonbank assets and offbalance sheet exposure csc is subject to the requirements under category iii based on its total consolidated assets of between 250 billion and less than 700 billion and having less than 75 billion in crossjurisdictional activity 

capital requirements for category iii banking organizations include the generally applicable riskbased capital and tier 1 leverage ratio requirements the “standardized approach” framework the minimum 30 supplementary leverage ratio and the countercyclical capital buffer which is currently 0 category iii organizations are no longer subject to the “advanced approaches” regulatory capital framework and are permitted to opt out of including aoci in their regulatory capital calculations csc made this opt out election and commencing with the first quarter of 2020 now excludes aoci from its regulatory capital 

as revised by the interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules category iii banking organizations with less than 75 billion in weighted shortterm wholesale funding which includes csc and their depository institution subsidiaries with 10 billion or more in total consolidated assets are subject to a reduced lcr rule requiring them to hold hqla in an amount equal to at least 85 of their projected net cash outflows over a prospective 30calendarday period of acute liquidity stress calculated on each business day if an institution’s weighted shortterm wholesale funding is 75 billion or more it will be required to comply with the full lcr rule and hold hqla in an amount equal to 100 of its projected 30day net cash outflows and will also be subject to daily instead of monthly liquidity reporting 

capital stress testing 

during 2019 savings and loan and bank holding companies and insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of more than 10 billion were required to conduct annual companyrun stress tests using certain scenarios and prescribed stresstesting methodologies under the doddfrank act stress test rules csc reported the results to the federal reserve and csb reported the results to the occ both published summaries of their stress test results 

in final enhanced prudential standards rules adopted concurrently in october 2019 with the interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules the federal reserve revised the capital stress testing regime applicable to savings and loan holding companies under the new federal reserve enhanced prudential standards rules savings and loan holding companies that are category iii banking organizations are required to conduct biennial companyrun stress tests in evennumbered years 

 8  

the charles schwab corporation 

beginning in 2020 csc will continue to be required to report the results of its stress testing to the federal reserve and publish a summary of its stress test results in accordance with the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act enacted in may 2018 the occ also adopted amendments to its companyrun stress testing rule in october 2019 increasing the minimum threshold for federal savings associations to conduct stress tests from 10 billion to 250 billion in consolidated assets as a result csb is currently not subject to any companyrun stress testing requirements 

in its enhanced prudential standards rules the federal reserve also made category iii savings and loan holding companies subject to an annual supervisory stress testing requirement in which the federal reserve conducts its own stress testing analysis to evaluate the ability of a holding company to absorb losses in specified economic and financial conditions over a ninequarter planning horizon using such analytical techniques as the agency determines are appropriate this supervisory stress testing requirement will go into effect for csc beginning with the 2022 stress testing cycle to implement this requirement the federal reserve is also expanding the reporting requirements applicable to savings and loan holding companies commencing in the second quarter of 2020 the federal reserve has also indicated that in the future large savings and loan holding companies including csc will become subject to an annual comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar process which requires submission of an annual capital plan to the federal reserve however to date the federal reserve has not yet proposed modifications to its existing capital planning requirements to extend them to savings and loan holding companies 

additional enhanced prudential standards 

in addition to the revisions to the capital stress testing regime discussed above the federal reserve’s enhanced prudential standards rules will also extend the applicability of certain additional enhanced prudential standards to large savings and loan holding companies with the specific requirements tailored based on the same fourcategory framework utilized in the interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules these additional enhanced prudential standards which have been applicable to large us bank holding companies under section 165 of the doddfrank act include risk management and risk committee requirements liquidity risk management stress testing and buffer requirements and single counterparty credit limits csc will be required to comply with the new risk management and risk committee requirements as well as the new liquidity riskmanagement stress testing and buffer requirements commencing on january 1 2021 the new single counterparty credit limits will go into effect for csc on january 1 2022 

insured depository institution resolution plans 

the fdic requires insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more to submit to the fdic periodic plans providing for their resolution by the fdic in the event of failure resolution plans or socalled “living wills” under the receivership and liquidation provisions of the federal deposit insurance act under this requirement csb has been required to file with the fdic a periodic resolution plan demonstrating how the bank could be resolved in an orderly and timely manner in the event of receivership such that the fdic would be able to ensure that the bank’s depositors receive access to their deposits within one business day maximize the net present value of the bank’s assets when disposed of and minimize losses incurred by the bank’s creditors in april 2019 the fdic approved an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on ways to tailor and improve its insured depository institution resolution plan rule at the same time the fdic announced that it would delay the next round of resolution plan submissions under the rule until this rulemaking process has been completed 

as a savings and loan holding company csc is not subject to any separate holding company resolution plan requirement 

consumer financial protection 

the cfpb has broad rulemaking supervisory and enforcement authority for a wide range of federal consumer protection laws relating to financial products the cfpb has examination and primary enforcement authority over depository institutions with 10 billion or more in consolidated total assets 

deposit insurance assessments 

the fdic’s deposit insurance fund dif provides insurance coverage for certain deposits generally up to 250000 per depositor per account ownership type and is funded by quarterly assessments on insured depository institutions the fdic uses a riskbased deposit premium assessment system that for large insured depository institutions with at least 10 billion in total consolidated assets uses a scorecard method based on a number of factors including the institution’s regulatory 

 9  

the charles schwab corporation 

ratings asset quality and brokered deposits the deposit insurance assessment base is calculated as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity 

in july 2016 the fdic imposed a flatrate quarterly surcharge on insured depository institutions with total assets of 10 billion or more and certain of their bank affiliates to pay for an increase to the dif from 115 to 135 of the assessment base as a result schwab’s banking subsidiaries became subject to an additional 45 basis point surcharge on the amount of their aggregate assessment base in excess of 10 billion in the third quarter of 2018 the dif ratio exceeded 135 and the fdic eliminated the surcharge beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018 

community reinvestment act 

the community reinvestment act of 1977 cra requires the primary federal bank regulatory agency for each of schwab’s depository institution subsidiaries to assess the subsidiary’s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank including low and moderateincome neighborhoods and persons institutions are assigned one of four ratings “outstanding” “satisfactory” “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance” the failure of an institution to receive at least a “satisfactory” rating could inhibit the institution or its holding company from undertaking certain activities including acquisitions or opening branch offices on january 9 2020 the occ and fdic published their jointly proposed revisions to the regulations implementing the cra see item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – current regulatory environment and other developments 

source of strength 

the doddfrank act codified the federal reserve’s longheld position that a depository institution holding company must serve as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary depository institutions the socalled “source of strength doctrine” in effect the holding company may be compelled to commit resources to support the subsidiary in the event the subsidiary is in financial distress

developments in the business economic and geopolitical environment could negatively impact our business 

our business can be adversely affected by the general environment – economic corporate securities market regulatory and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations trading activity interest rates and overall investor engagement and are outside of our control deterioration in the housing and credit markets reduction in shortterm interest rates and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact our results of operations and capital resources 

extensive regulation of our businesses may subject us to significant penalties or limitations on business activities 

as a participant in the securities banking and financial services industries we are subject to extensive regulation under federal state and foreign laws by governmental agencies supervisory authorities and sros the costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase these regulations affect our business operations and impose capital client protection and market conduct requirements on us 

in addition to specific banking laws and regulations our banking regulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies and could require csc andor our banking subsidiaries to hold more capital increase liquidity or limit their ability to pay dividends or csc’s ability to repurchase or redeem shares the banking regulators could also limit our ability to grow including adding assets launching new products making acquisitions and undertaking strategic investments other potential regulatory actions include limiting our banking subsidiaries’ ability to accept deposits swept from client brokerage accounts and brokered deposits and preventing us from pursuing our business strategy 

despite our efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements there are a number of risks particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by our regulators against us or our affiliates officers or employees could result in fines penalties cease and desist orders enforcement actions suspension disqualification or expulsion or other disciplinary sanctions including limitations on our business activities any of which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

while we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations violations could occur in addition some legalregulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time there may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance including restrictions on certain activities such a finding may also damage our reputation and our relationships with our regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities 

legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect our business and financial results 

new legislation rules regulations and guidance or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal state foreign and sro rules regulations and guidance including changes relating to mutual funds brokerdealer fiduciary duties and regulatory treatment of deposit accounts may directly affect the operation and profitability of schwab or its specific business lines our profitability could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally including changes to the laws governing taxation electronic commerce client privacy and security of client data in addition the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct modifications to our business practices more stringent capital and liquidity requirements increased deposit insurance assessments or additional costs and could limit our ability to return capital to stockholders these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance risk management treasury and operations functions 

failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect our financial condition 

csc together with its banking and brokerdealer subsidiaries must meet certain capital and liquidity standards subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of schwab’s capital and schwab’s internal assessment of its capital needs the uniform net capital rule limits csco’s ability to transfer capital to csc and other affiliates new regulatory capital liquidity and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital including paying dividends stock repurchases and redemptions and may require us to increase our capital andor liquidity or to limit our 

 12  

the charles schwab corporation 

growth failure by either csc or its banking subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have a negative impact on us in addition failure by csc or our banking subsidiaries to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy their capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer requirements would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as tier 1 capital or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could require us to liquidate assets deleverage or otherwise change our business andor investment plans which may adversely affect our financial results issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders 

effective december 31 2019 csc was assigned to category iii of the new tailored regulatory requirements the federal reserve indicated that large savings and loan holding companies including csc will become subject to the ccar process if csc reaches 700 billion in total assets or 75 billion in crossjurisdictional activity csc will become subject to more stringent category ii requirements including annual stress testing the advanced approaches framework the inability to opt out of including aoci in regulatory capital calculations the full lcr rule and daily liquidity reporting csc will also be subject to the full lcr rule and daily liquidity reporting if its weighted shortterm wholesale funding is 75 billion or more 

a significant change in client cash allocations could negatively impact our net interest revenue 

we rely heavily on bank deposits as a funding source to extend loans to clients and purchase investment securities our bank deposits are primarily driven by our bank sweep feature when cash awaiting investment in our client brokerage accounts is swept to our banking subsidiaries a significant reduction in our clients’ allocation to cash a change in the allocation of that cash or a transfer of cash away from the company could reduce net interest revenue 

significant interest rate changes could affect our profitability 

the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings a decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on our net interest revenue a low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact on our asset management and administration fee revenues if we have to waive a portion of our management fees for certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds in order to continue providing a positive return to clients 

although we believe we are positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment a rise in interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase if market conditions or the competitive environment induces us to raise our interest rates to avoid losing deposits or replace deposits with higher cost funding sources without offsetting increases in yields on interestearning assets can reduce our net interest revenue 

the expected phaseout of libor could negatively impact our net interest revenue and require significant operational work 

certain securities in our investment portfolio and the floating rate loans we offer reference libor as the benchmark rate to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount we also use libor in many of our financial models such as those used for capital stress testing and to determine the dividend rates for certain of our series of preferred stock which begin to float in 2022 and later if libor is discontinued after 2021 as expected there will be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments and there will be significant work required to transition to using the new benchmark rates and implement necessary changes to our systems and financial models this could result in different financial performance for previously booked transactions and may impact our existing transaction data products systems operations and pricing processes the calculation of interest rates under the replacement benchmarks could also impact our net interest revenue in addition libor may perform differently during the phaseout period than in the past which could result in lower interest payments and a reduction in the value of certain securities in our investment portfolio 

security breaches of our systems or those of our clients or third parties may subject us to significant liability and damage schwab’s reputation 

our business involves the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential information about our clients and us information security risks for financial institutions are increasing in part because of the use of the internet and mobile technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime activists hackers and other external parties including foreign state actors our systems and those of other financial institutions have 

 13  

the charles schwab corporation 

been and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks malicious code computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access misuse loss or destruction of data including confidential client information account takeovers unavailability of service or other events despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means for example employee misconduct 

given the high volume of transactions that we process the large number of clients counterparties and thirdparty service providers with which we do business and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected the extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before an investigation is completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known during such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack 

security breaches including breaches of our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers or clients could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject us to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance actions by our regulators damage to schwab’s reputation or a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures 

we also face risk related to external fraud involving the misappropriation and use of clients’ user names passwords or other personal information to gain access to clients’ financial accounts at schwab this could occur from the compromise of clients’ personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company where clients’ personal information is taken and then made available to fraudsters such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties including foreign statesponsored parties losses reimbursed to clients under our guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

technology and operational failures or errors could subject us to losses litigation regulatory actions and reputational damage 

we must process record and monitor a large number of transactions and our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to our systems system interruptions errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes including changes in client use patterns technological failure changes to our systems linkages with thirdparty systems and power failures and can have a significant impact on our business and operations our systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error execution errors errors in models such as those used for asset management capital planning and management risk management stress testing and compliance employee misconduct unauthorized trading external fraud computer viruses distributed denial of service attacks cyber attacks terrorist attacks natural disaster power outage capacity constraints software flaws events impacting key business partners and vendors and similar events for example schwab and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have in certain circumstances made websites mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time it could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to our technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence which could affect our ability to process and settle client transactions moreover instances of fraud or other misconduct might also negatively impact schwab’s reputation and client confidence in the company in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances despite our efforts to identify areas of risk oversee operational areas involving risk and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks there can be no assurance that we will not suffer unexpected losses reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors including those of our vendors or other third parties 

while we devote substantial attention and resources to the reliability capacity and scalability of our systems extraordinary trading volumes could cause our computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail affecting our ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients’ orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses and decreased client satisfaction we are also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges clearing houses and other 

 14  

the charles schwab corporation 

intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement system failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices cause substantial losses for us and for our clients and subject us to claims from our clients for damages 

  

our investment management operations may subject us to fiduciary or other legal liability for client losses 

fund and trust management and administration are complex activities and include functions such as recordkeeping and accounting security pricing corporate actions compliance with investment restrictions daily net asset value computations account reconciliations and required distributions to fund shareholders failure to properly perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of our services and products could subject us to regulatory sanctions penalties or litigation and result in reputational damage liability to clients and the termination of investment management or administration agreements and the withdrawal of assets under our management 

in the management and administration of funds and client accounts we use quantitative models and other tools and resources to support investment decisions and processes including those related to risk assessment portfolio management trading and hedging activities and product valuations errors in the design function or underlying assumptions used in these models and tools particularly if we fail to detect the errors over an extended period could subject us to claims of a breach of fiduciary duty and potentially large liabilities for makewhole payments litigation andor regulatory fines 

a significant decrease in our liquidity could negatively affect our business as well as reduce client confidence in schwab 

maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our business operations including transaction settlement custody requirements and lending commitments among other liquidity needs we meet our liquidity needs primarily from working capital and cash generated by client activity as well as external financing fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances as well as market conditions or changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits may affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs a reduction in our liquidity position could reduce client confidence in schwab which could result in the transfer of client assets and accounts or could cause us to fail to satisfy our liquidity requirements including the lcr in addition if our brokerdealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to csc which could reduce csc’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt pay dividends on csc’s preferred stock or return capital to common stockholders in addition csc may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries 

factors which may adversely affect our liquidity position include csco having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances fluctuations in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts a dramatic increase in our lending activities including margin mortgagerelated and personal lending increased capital requirements changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations other regulatory changes or a loss of market or client confidence in schwab resulting in unanticipated withdrawals of client funds 

when available cash is not sufficient for our liquidity needs we may seek external financing during periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets potential sources of external financing could be reduced and borrowing costs could increase although csc and csco maintain committed and uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines and csc has a commercial paper issuance program as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec which can be used to sell securities financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets in addition a significant downgrade in the company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets 

we may suffer significant losses from our credit exposures 

our businesses are subject to the risk that a client counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate while we have policies and procedures designed to manage this risk the policies and procedures may not be fully effective our exposure mainly results from margin lending clients’ options and futures trading securities lending mortgage lending pledged asset lending our role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds we sponsor 

 15  

the charles schwab corporation 

when clients purchase securities on margin borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities or trade options or futures we are subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients’ indebtedness abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses 

we have exposure to credit risk associated with our investments those investments are subject to price fluctuations loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such loss of value has resulted from a credit loss the evaluation of whether a credit loss exists is a matter of judgment which includes the assessment of multiple factors if management determines that a security’s decline in fair value is the result of a credit loss an allowance for credit losses on the security will be recorded and a corresponding loss will be recognized in current earnings even if a decline in fair value of a security is not determined to have resulted from a credit loss if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs we would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time 

  

our bank loans primarily consist of first mortgages helocs and pals increases in delinquency and default rates housing and stock price declines increases in the unemployment rate and other economic factors can result in increases in allowances for credit losses and related credit loss expense as well as write downs on such loans 

on january 1 2020 the company adopted accounting standards update asu 201613 “ financial instruments – credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments” which requires estimation of expected lifetime credit losses rather than incurred losses only as was previously required for more information on this adoption see part ii – item 8 – notes to consolidated financial statements – note 2 

heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments can increase our risk of loss examples include 

 

we sponsor a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds although we have no obligation to do so we may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit liquidity or other support to our funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity such support could cause us to take significant charges could reduce our liquidity and in certain situations could with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds result in us having to consolidate one or more funds in our financial statements if we choose not to provide credit liquidity or other support in such a situation schwab could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected 

we are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending against claims or proceedings 

the financial services industry faces significant litigation and regulatory risks we are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business including arbitrations class actions and other litigation some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages we are also the subject of inquiries investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies 

litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by our clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied at schwab claims from clients of third party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors’ misconduct litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights eg patents such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources if we were found to have infringed on a thirdparty patent or other intellectual property rights we could incur substantial damages and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology or providing certain products or services 

actions brought against us may result in settlements awards injunctions fines penalties or other results adverse to us including reputational harm even if we are successful in defending against these actions the defense of such matters may 

 16  

the charles schwab corporation 

result in us incurring significant expenses a substantial judgment settlement fine or penalty could be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular future period depending on our results for that period in market downturns and periods of heightened volatility the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased 

we rely on outsourced service providers to perform key functions 

we rely on external service providers to perform certain key technology processing servicing and support functions these service providers face technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information could cause us to incur losses and could harm schwab’s reputation an interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints financial difficulties or for any other reason and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in financial losses to us switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations 

potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on our financial position 

we evaluate potential strategic transactions including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions any such transaction could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows the process of evaluating negotiating and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert management’s attention from other business concerns and might cause the loss of key clients employees and business partners moreover integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties including the need to integrate operational financial and management information systems and management controls integrate relationships with clients and business partners and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas in addition an acquisition may cause us to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings further we may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition including without limitation the pending acquisitions of td ameritrade and assets of usaaimco and any future acquisition could be dilutive to our current stockholders’ percentage ownership or to earnings per common share eps 

our acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business operations or financial condition of the entity being acquired or sold to the extent we enter into an agreement to buy or sell an entity there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected or at all if a material transaction does not close our stock price could decline 

our industry is highly competitive and characterized by aggressive price competition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment with a broad array of competitors from large integrated banks to venturecapital backed private companies we continually monitor our pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjust interest rates on deposits and loans fees for advisory services expense ratios on mutual funds and etfs trade commission rates and other pricing and incentives to sustain our competitive position increased price competition from other financial services firms to attract clients such as reduced commissions higher deposit rates reduced mutual fund or etf expense ratios or the increased use of incentives could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

we face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees 

the market for qualified personnel in our business is highly competitive at various times different functions and roles are in especially high demand in the market compelling us to pay more to attract talent our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs 

 17  

the charles schwab corporation 

our stock price has fluctuated historically and may continue to fluctuate 

our stock price can be volatile among the factors that may affect the volatility of our stock price are the following 

 

changes in the stock market generally or as it concerns our industry as well as geopolitical corporate regulatory business and economic factors may also affect our stock price 

future sales of csc’s equity securities may adversely affect the market price of csc’s common stock and result in dilution 

csc’s certificate of incorporation authorizes csc’s board of directors among other things to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities without stockholder approval 

csc may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes the issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of csc’s common stock and may adversely affect the market price of csc’s common stock 

risks related to the proposed merger with td ameritrade 

completion of the merger is subject to many conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived the merger will not be completed 

the obligations of csc and td ameritrade to complete the merger are subject to satisfaction or to the extent permitted by applicable law waiver of a number of conditions including among others 

 

there can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the merger will be satisfied or waived in a timely manner or at all and accordingly the merger may not be completed if the merger is not completed for any reason the ongoing business of csc may be adversely affected and without realizing the benefits of having completed the merger we would be subject to a number of risks including that we may receive negative reactions from our stockholders employees customers and regulators and that the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed 

 18  

the charles schwab corporation 

as a condition to authorization of the merger governmental authorities may impose requirements limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of our business after completion of the merger such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could among other things have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger or otherwise adversely affecting our businesses and results of operations after completion of the merger 

also if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances we may be required to pay a termination fee of 950 million to td ameritrade and we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the merger agreement 

in addition the merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our businesses prior to completion of the merger and such restrictions the waiver of which is subject to consent of td ameritrade could prevent us from making certain acquisitions taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the merger that we would have made taken or pursued if these restrictions were not in place 

csc and td ameritrade may also be subject to lawsuits challenging the merger and adverse rulings in these lawsuits may delay or prevent the merger from being completed or require csc or td ameritrade to incur significant costs to defend or settle these lawsuits 

if any of these risks materialize they may materially and adversely affect our businesses financial condition financial results ratings andor stock price 

schwab’s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the merger 

parties with which we do business may experience uncertainty associated with the merger including with respect to current or future business relationships with schwab or the combined business schwab’s business relationships may be subject to disruption as parties with which schwab does business may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than schwab or the combined business these disruptions could have an adverse effect on the businesses financial condition results of operations or prospects of the combined business including an adverse effect on schwab’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger the risk and adverse effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement 

after completion of the merger we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger which could adversely affect the value of our stock 

the success of the merger will depend in significant part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses of schwab and td ameritrade our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to certain risks if schwab is not able to successfully combine the businesses of schwab and td ameritrade within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected the combined business may not perform as expected and the value of schwab common stock may be adversely affected 

schwab and td ameritrade have operated and until completion of the merger will continue to operate independently and there can be no assurances that their businesses can be integrated successfully it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key schwab or td ameritrade employees the loss of clients the disruption of either company’s or both companies’ ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues higher than expected integration costs and an overall postcompletion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated 

in addition at times the attention of certain members of either company’s or both companies’ management and resources may be focused on completion of the merger and the integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from daytoday business operations which may disrupt each company’s ongoing business and the business of the combined company 

schwab will incur significant transaction and mergerrelated costs in connection with the merger 

we expect to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with the merger and combining the operations of the two 

 19  

the charles schwab corporation 

companies some of these costs have already been incurred or may be incurred regardless of whether the merger is completed schwab also will incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans with respect to the two companies including facilities and systems consolidation costs we continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the merger and the integration of the two companies’ businesses although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses should allow us to offset integrationrelated costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all 

schwab and td ameritrade may have difficulty attracting motivating and retaining executives and other employees in light of the merger 

uncertainty about the effect of the merger on schwab and td ameritrade employees may impair schwab’s and td ameritrade’s ability to attract retain and motivate personnel prior to and following the merger employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the merger as employees of schwab and td ameritrade may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined business in addition pursuant to changeincontrol provisions in their respective employment agreements or term sheets with td ameritrade certain employees of td ameritrade are entitled to receive severance payments upon a constructive termination of employment such td ameritrade employees potentially could terminate their employment following specified circumstances set forth in their employment agreements or term sheets including certain changes in such employees’ position compensation or benefits and collect severance such circumstances could occur in connection with the merger as a result of changes in roles and responsibilities if employees of schwab or td ameritrade depart the integration of the companies may be more difficult and the combined business following the merger may be harmed furthermore schwab may have to incur significant costs in identifying hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to the businesses of schwab or td ameritrade and schwab’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger may be adversely affected in addition there could be disruptions to or distractions for the workforce and management associated with integrating employees into schwab 

the merger may not be accretive to schwab’s earnings per share which may negatively affect the market price of schwab common stock following completion of the merger 

in connection with the completion of the merger schwab expects to issue approximately 586 million schwab common shares the issuance of new schwab common shares could have the effect of depressing the market price of schwab common shares 

based on the anticipated synergies between schwab and td ameritrade the merger is expected to be accretive to schwab’s earnings per share in the third year following completion of the merger however future events and conditions could reduce or delay the accretion that is currently projected or result in the merger being dilutive to schwab’s earnings per share including adverse changes in market conditions additional transaction and integration related costs and other factors such as the failure to realize some or all of the benefits anticipated in the merger any dilution of reduction in or delay of any accretion to schwab’s earnings per share could cause the price of shares of schwab common stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate 

if our pending merger with td ameritrade is completed our stockholders’ ownership percentage will be diluted 

if the proposed merger is completed we will issue to td ameritrade stockholders shares of our common stock as a result of the issuance of these shares of our common stock our stockholders will own a smaller percentage of the combined company after the merger and will therefore have a reduced voting interest in addition td bank will become our largest stockholder

overview 

management focuses on several client activity and financial metrics in evaluating schwab’s financial position and operating performance we believe that metrics relating to net new and total client assets as well as client cash levels and utilization of advisory services offer perspective on our business momentum and client engagement data on new and total client brokerage accounts provides additional perspective on our ability to attract and retain new business total net revenue growth pretax profit margin eps return on average common stockholders’ equity and the consolidated tier 1 leverage ratio provide broad indicators of schwab’s overall financial health operating efficiency and ability to generate acceptable returns total expenses excluding interest as a percentage of average client assets is a measure of operating efficiency results for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017 are as follows 



1 2019 and 2017 include inflows of 111 billion and 345 billion respectively from certain mutual fund clearing services clients 2018 includes outflows of 939 billion from certain mutual fund clearing services clients

total net revenues reached 107 billion up 6 in 2019 net interest revenue increased 12 in 2019 to 65 billion driven by higher average investment yields and also by an increase in client cash balances held at our bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries while trading revenue declined 19 to 617 million due to our pricing actions asset management and administration fees remained essentially flat with 2018 at 32 billion decreasing 1 growing enrollment in advice solutions along with rising balances in other thirdparty mutual funds helped to largely offset declines in mutual fund onesource ® and lower sweep money market fund revenue due to transfers of sweep money market funds to our balance sheet in 2018 and early 2019 

total expenses excluding interest increased 5 in 2019 to 59 billion which included 62 million in severance charges associated with a 3 reduction in our workforce and 25 million in costs relating to the announced acquisitions of assets of usaaimco and td ameritrade our ongoing focus on driving efficiency while managing our spending in a disciplined manner helped us maintain a ratio of expenses to client assets of 16 bps for 2019 reflecting our commitment to balancing longterm profitability with reinvesting for growth we achieved a 452 pretax profit margin and a 19 return on equity in 2019 representing our second consecutive year of at least 45 and 19 respectively

2018 compared to 2017 

net income increased by 12 billion or 49 in 2018 driven primarily by business momentum a supportive economic environment for much of the year and lower corporate tax rates continued execution of our ‘through clients’ eyes’ strategy helped us succeed with clients in 2018 clients opened 16 million new brokerage accounts helping bring active brokerage accounts to 116 million at the end of the year and core net new assets totaled 2278 billion up 15 from the 2017 total our strong net new assets largely offset lower market valuations and we ended 2018 at 325 trillion in total client assets 

total net revenue grew by 15 billion or 18 in 2018 primarily due to an increase of 15 billion or 36 in net interest revenue the fed raised the federal funds target interest rate four times in 2018 for a total of 100 basis points the growth of total net revenue resulted from higher interest rates due to the fed’s rate increases and also from higher interestearning assets which reflect both client cash allocations and the transfer of sweep money market funds to bank and brokerdealer sweep as we progressed with these transfers the corresponding money market fund asset management and administration fee revenue naturally declined yet positive inflows in advice solutions schwab equity and bond funds and etfs and other thirdparty mutual funds and etfs kept asset management fees at 32 billion limiting the decrease to 5 from 2017 record trading activity from our clients resulted in trading revenue reaching 763 million an increase of 17 from the prior year 

our increase in total expenses excluding interest of 602 million or 12 reflected our 2018 investments to support and fuel our business growth including hiring additional clientfacing and other employees and technology project spending as well as an increase in marketing and a special stock award of 36 million to our employees even with these increases expenses as a percentage of client assets remained consistent at 16 basis points and pretax income increased 25 to 46 billion in 2018 resulting in a pretax profit margin of 450 as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act taxes on income decreased 19 in 2018 resulting in an effective tax rate of 231 overall we generated a 19 return on equity and diluted eps of 245 for the year 

during 2018 the board of directors raised the quarterly cash dividend 63 to 013 per share and authorized a 10 billion share repurchase program which we completed during the fourth quarter of 2018 these actions reflected the company’s strong financial performance and our confidence in its longterm success they also demonstrated that effective capital management at schwab can support both healthy business growth and more meaningful capital returns to stockholders 

subsequent events 

in october 2019 the federal reserve issued a final enhanced prudential standards rule and the federal reserve occ and the fdic jointly issued a final regulatory capital and liquidity rule with total consolidated assets of 2940 billion at december 31 2019 csc is designated as a category iii firm pursuant to the framework established by the final rules accordingly the company opted to exclude aoci from its regulatory capital as permitted by the regulatory capital and liquidity rule beginning january 1 2020 in accordance with asc 320 investments – debt and equity securities asc 320 and as of january 1 2020 the company transferred all of its investment securities designated as held to maturity htm to the afs category without tainting our intent to hold other debt securities to maturity at the date of transfer these securities had a total amortized cost of 1347 billion and a total net unrealized gain of 14 billion 

current regulatory environment and other developments 

in december 2019 the fdic issued a proposed rule that would modernize its brokered deposits regulations among other things the proposed rule would clarify the “primary purpose” exception from the definition of a deposit broker for securities brokerdealers such as csco that place deposits through brokerage sweep arrangements under certain conditions in addition the proposed rule would create a streamlined application process for obtaining a primary purpose exception where less than 25 percent of a brokerdealer’s customer assets are placed with a depository institution schwab is currently evaluating the impact of the proposed rule on its bank sweep program 

in january 2020 the occ and the fdic published their jointly proposed revisions to the regulations implementing the cra the proposed regulations i clarify and expand what qualifies for cra credit ii expand where cra activity counts iii provide an objective method to measure cra activity and iv revise data collection recordkeeping and reporting the

results of operations 

total net revenues 

total net revenues of 107 billion and 101 billion for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively represented growth of 6 and 18 from the prior periods primarily due to increases in net interest revenue 



1 beginning in 2019 a change was made to move ctfs from other asset management and administration fees prior periods have been recast to reflect this change 

net interest revenue 

schwab’s primary interestearning assets include cash and cash equivalents cash and investments segregated margin loans which constitute the majority of receivables from brokerage clients investment securities and bank loans revenue on interestearning assets is affected by various factors such as the composition of assets prevailing interest rates and spreads at the time of origination or purchase changes in interest rates on floating rate securities and loans and changes in prepayment levels for mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities and loans fees earned on securities borrowing and lending activities which are conducted by csco using assets held in client brokerage accounts are primarily included in other interest revenue and expense 

schwab’s interestbearing liabilities include bank deposits payables to brokerage clients shortterm borrowings eg federal home loan bank fhlb advances and longterm debt noninterestbearing funding sources include stockholders’ equity certain client cash balances and other miscellaneous liabilities 

we establish the rates paid on clientrelated liabilities and management expects that it will generally adjust the rates paid on these liabilities at some fraction of any movement in shortterm rates schwab deploys the funds from these sources into the 

 33  

the charles schwab corporation 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted 

assets outlined above we do not use shortterm wholesale borrowings to support our longterm investment activity but may use such funding including fhlb advances for shortterm liquidity purposes or to provide temporary funding eg for investment purchases ahead of anticipated balance sheet deposit growth 

in order to keep interestrate sensitivity within established limits management actively monitors and adjusts interestrate sensitivity through changes in the balance sheet primarily by adjusting the composition of our banking subsidiaries’ investment portfolios as schwab builds its client base we attract new client sweep cash which is a primary driver of funding balance sheet growth 

towards the end of 2018 the federal funds target interest rate increased to levels not seen in over a decade leading us to expect some clients would shift more of their cash holdings from brokerage deposits swept to our banking subsidiaries to higheryielding alternatives like purchased money market funds we therefore expected brokerage deposits swept to our banking subsidiaries excluding organic growth to decline during the first part of 2019 as a result we held a higher amount of shortterm liquidity at our banking subsidiaries at the end of 2018 to accommodate this potential client cash sorting 

while average interest rates throughout the year in 2019 were higher than average rates in 2018 interest rates across maturities declined from december 2018 to december 2019 lower interest rates typically result in longer durations on our clientrelated liabilities and shorter durations on our investment securities especially mortgagerelated securities with options to prepay without penalty during 2019 to maintain our overall targeted interest rate risk profile we began positioning our banking entities’ investment portfolios to include a higher percentage of fixedrate longer duration investments to reduce our interest rate sensitivities which would naturally increase as market rates declined we did however once again hold a higher level of shortterm liquidity at the end of 2019 to accommodate a typical seasonal buildup of client cash much of which then generally moves to other assets within a few months 

we believe that the process of clients sorting between transactional cash and cash held for investment is subsiding aligned with market consensus we do not expect to see a significant increase in market rates in the near term over the course of 2020 we expect to further reduce our exposure to lower rates primarily by adding a larger percentage of fixedrate securities with relatively longer duration to our ongoing purchases as a result of maturities prepayments organic deposit growth onboarding of usaaimco client cash to our balance sheet and any potential assetliabilitymanagementdriven investment portfolio rebalancing as such we expect the duration difference between our liabilities and assets to decline over the course of 2020

1 amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost 

2 interest revenue or expense was less than 500000 in the period or periods presented 

net interest revenue increased 693 million or 12  in 2019 from 2018  and 15 billion  or 36  in 2018 from 2017  due to higher average investment yields and growth in interest earning assets 

our net interest margin improved 12 basis points to 241 in 2019  driven primarily by higher average yields received on interestearning assets in 2019 due largely to the net impact of the federal reserve’s interest rate increases in 2018 and decreases in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 the increase in average yields on interestearning assets was partially offset by higher average interest rates paid on bank deposits and other interestbearing liabilities the portfolio adjustments made in 2019 as described above helped to moderate the impact of the declining rate environment on our net interest margin 

average interestearning assets grew 6 from 2018 to 2019  primarily driven by higher bank deposits due to transfers from sweep money market funds to bank sweep as well as higher client cash balances 

our net interest margin improved 32 basis points to 229 in 2018 primarily as a result of the federal reserve’s 2017 and 2018 interest rate increases partially offset by higher interest rates paid on bank deposits and other interestbearing liabilities average interest earning assets grew 16 from 2017 to 2018 primarily reflecting higher bank deposits due to transfers from sweep money market funds to bank sweep as well as changes in client cash allocations partially offset by client purchases of other assets in march 2017 the company transferred 247 billion of debt securities from the afs category to the htm category the transfer had no effect on the overall net interest margin shortterm borrowings in 2018 and 2017 primarily included fhlb advances which were used to provide temporary funding for investments ahead of deposit growth

trading revenue 

trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues commission revenue is affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from trading activity in fixed income securities with clients to accommodate clients’ fixed income trading activity schwab maintains positions in fixed income securities including us state and municipal debt obligations us government and corporate debt and other securities the difference between the price at which the company buys and sells securities to and from its clients and other brokerdealers is recognized as principal transaction revenue principal transaction revenue also includes adjustments to the fair value of these securities positions 

the following table presents trading revenue and the related drivers 



trading revenue decreased by 146 million  or 19  in 2019 compared to 2018 the decrease was primarily due to a 20 decrease in dart volumes in 2019 as a result of the elimination of online trading commissions for us and canadianlisted stocks and etfs as well as the base charge on options effective october 7 2019 

trading revenue increased by 109 million or 17 in 2018 compared to 2017 this increase was due primarily to a 31 increase in dart volumes in 2018 which more than offset schwab’s 2017 commission pricing reductions to lower standard equity etf and option trade commissions from 895 to 495 and lower the per contract option fee from 75 to 65 

other revenue 

other revenue includes order flow revenue other service fees software fees from our portfolio management solutions exchange processing fees and nonrecurring gains other revenue increased  60 million  or 19  in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to a gain from the sale of a portfolio management and reporting software solution for advisors to tamarac inc in the second quarter of 2019 and a gain from the assignment of leased office space in the first quarter of 2019 order flow revenue was 135 million during 2019  139 million for 2018  and 114 million in 2017  the increase in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to higher rebate rates received on certain types of orders and higher volume of trades

total expenses excluding interest 

the following table shows a comparison of total expenses excluding interest 



໿ 

expenses excluding interest increased in 2019 and 2018 from the prior years by 5 and 12 respectively the largest driver of the increase in both years was compensation and benefits costs 

total compensation and benefits increased in 2019 from 2018  primarily due to both an overall increase in employee headcount to support our expanding client base and higher severance costs which included 62 million associated with a 3 reduction in our workforce in the third quarter of 2019 the increase in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to increases in employee headcount additionally special stock awards were issued in 2018 to nonofficer employees totaling 36 million 

professional services expense increased in 2019 from 2018  primarily due to overall growth in the business investments in projects to further drive efficiency and scale and certain costs relating to pending acquisitions the increase in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to higher spending on technology projects as well as an increase in asset management and administration related expenses resulting from growth in the schwab funds ® and schwab etfs™ 

occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2019 and 2018 from the prior years primarily due to increases in software maintenance expenses and additional licenses to support growth in the business 

advertising and market development expense increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily reflecting management’s decision to increase television advertising and digital media spending in the fourth quarter of 2018 

depreciation and amortization expenses grew in 2019 and 2018 from the prior years primarily due to higher amortization of internally developed software associated with continued investments in software and technology enhancements 

regulatory fees and assessments decreased in 2019 from 2018  primarily due to a decrease in fdic insurance assessments resulting from the elimination of the fdic surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018 regulatory fees and assessments

increased in 2018 from 2017 due to an increase in fdic insurance assessments which rose as a result of higher average assets in deposit balances partially offset by the elimination of the fdic surcharge 

other expenses decreased in 2019 from 2018  primarily due to lower travel and entertainment expense and bad debt expense other expenses increased in 2018 from 2017 due to travel and entertainment and miscellaneous items due to overall growth in the business 

capital expenditures were 753 million  576 million  and 412 million in 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively the increases in capital expenditures in 2019 and 2018 from the prior years were primarily due to the expansion of our campuses in the us with investments in buildings totaling 397 million and 253 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively capitalized costs for developing internaluse software totaled 165 million 167 million and 157 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

our capital expenditures for 2019 equaled 7 of total net revenues within our estimated range for the year along with continued campus expansion we will continue to invest further in technology projects in 2020 excluding any potential impact of the pending acquisition of td ameritrade we anticipate capital expenditures in 2020 to be approximately 56 of total net revenues while our longer term expectation for capital expenditures remains in the range of 35 of total net revenues 

taxes on income 

on december 22 2017 pl11597 the tax act was signed into law and became effective on january 1 2018 among other things the tax act lowered the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning in 2018 as a result of the tax act schwab recognized a 46 million onetime noncash charge to taxes on income in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and other tax adjustments related to the tax act 

schwab’s effective income tax rate on income before taxes was 236 in 2019  231 in 2018  and 355 in 2017  the change in rates in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in equity compensation tax deduction benefits which reduced our tax expense by approximately 23 million and 46 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively the change in rates in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to impacts of the tax act and a decrease in equity compensation tax deduction benefits which totaled 87 million in 2017 

segment information 

schwab provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments – investor services and advisor services the investor services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors and retirement plan services as well as other corporate brokerage services to businesses and their employees the advisor services segment provides custodial trading banking and support services as well as retirement business services to independent rias independent retirement advisors and recordkeepers revenues and expenses are attributed to the two segments based on which segment services the client management evaluates the performance of the segments on a pretax basis segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments net revenues in both segments are generated from the underlying client assets and trading activity differences in the composition of net revenues between the segments are based on the composition of client assets client trading frequency and pricing unique to each while both segments leverage the scale and efficiency of our platforms segment expenses reflect the dynamics of serving millions of clients in investor services versus the thousands of rias on the advisor platform

fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client fiduciary activities include but are not limited to individual and institutional trust investment management custody and cash and securities processing we manage this risk by establishing policy and procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the policy and procedures applicable to their business guidance and control are provided through the creation approval and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees 

credit risk 

credit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower counterparty or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations our exposure to credit risk mainly results from investing activities in our liquidity and investment portfolios mortgage lending margin lending and client option and futures activities pledged asset lending securities lending activities and our role as a counterparty in other financial contracts to manage the risks of such losses we have established policies and procedures which include setting and reviewing credit limits monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties and adjusting margin pal option and futures requirements for certain securities and instruments 

liquidity and investment portfolios 

schwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios which include us agency and nonagency mortgagebacked securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities us agency notes us treasury securities certificates of deposit us state and municipal securities commercial paper and foreign government agency securities 

at december 31 2019  substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade us agency mortgagebacked securities do not have explicit credit ratings however management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the us government or us governmentsponsored enterprises 

mortgage lending portfolio 

the bank loan portfolio includes first mortgages helocs and other loans the credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews management regularly reviews asset quality including concentrations delinquencies nonaccrual loans chargeoffs and recoveries all are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for loan losses 

our residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum ltv ratios cash out limits and minimum fair isaac corporation fico credit scores the specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan for example whether the property is a primary or secondary residence whether the loan is for investment property whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo 

schwab does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a fico score of less than 620 at origination unless the borrower has compensating credit factors for more information on credit quality indicators relating to schwab’s bank loans see item 8 – note 6

other counterparty exposures 

schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations mutual funds and other financial institutions even if schwab’s clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to schwab 

market risk 

market risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or market conditions schwab is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on our interestearning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets 

to manage interest rate risk we have established policies and procedures which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity risk to remain within these limits we manage the maturity repricing and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios management monitors established guidelines to stay within the company’s risk appetite 

our measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and as a result cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue or economic value of equity actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies including changes in asset and liability mix financial instruments are also subject to the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument 

we are indirectly exposed to option futures and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers and client securities loaned out as part of the brokerage securities lending activities equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity margin borrowing and overall client engagement with schwab additionally we earn mutual fund and etf service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue we earn 

our market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material 

net interest revenue simulation 

for our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulations include all interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments repricing of financial instruments and reinvestment of matured or paiddown securities and loans 

net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets primarily include investment securities margin loans and bank loans these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans and control the composition of our investment securities we have some ability to manage our net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions

net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the simulated net interest revenue change over the next 12 months beginning december 31 2019 and 2018 of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period 



the yearoveryear change in net interest revenue sensitivities reflects lower interest rates across the yield curve producing higher adverse sensitivity to lower rates as funding costs more rapidly reach rate floor assumptions 

in addition to measuring the effect of a gradual 100 basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel and nonparallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue 

economic value of equity simulation 

management also uses economic value of equity eve simulations to measure interest rate risk eve sensitivity measures the longterm impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment key assumptions in our eve calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments term structure models of interest rates nonmaturity deposit behavior and pricing assumptions 

expected phaseout of libor 

the company has established a firmwide team to address the likely discontinuation of libor as part of our efforts we have inventoried our libor exposures the largest of which are certain investment securities and loans in purchasing new investment securities we ensure that appropriate fallback language is in the security’s prospectus in the event that libor is unavailable or deemed unreliable we are updating loan agreements to ensure new liborbased loans adequately provide for an alternative to libor furthermore we plan to phaseout the use of libor as a reference rate in our new lending products before december 2021 consistent with our “through clients’ eyes” strategy our focus throughout the libor transition process is to ensure clients are treated fairly and consistently as this major change is occurring in the financial markets the market transition process has not yet progressed to a point at which the impact to the company’s consolidated financial statements of libor’s discontinuation can be estimated 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the potential that schwab will be unable to sell assets or meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses 

due to its role as a source of financial strength csc’s liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of csco the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries principal and interest due on corporate debt dividend payments on csc’s preferred stock and returns of capital to common stockholders the liquidity needs of csco are primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin borrowing activities and capital expenditures the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries are primarily driven by client deposits we have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions we seek to maintain client confidence in the balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the company to meet its obligations to this end we have established limits and contingency funding scenarios to support liquidity levels during both business as usual and stressed conditions

we employ a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity we conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during marketrelated or companyspecific liquidity stress events liquidity is also tested at key subsidiaries and results are reported to the financial risk oversight committee a number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the organization and are reviewed with management as appropriate 

primary funding sources 

schwab’s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts these funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients 

other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations maturities and sales of investment securities repayments on loans securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts repurchase agreements and cash provided by external financing 

to meet daily funding needs we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and shortterm investments for unanticipated liquidity needs we also maintain a buffer of highly liquid investments including us treasury securities 

additional funding sources 

in addition to internal sources of liquidity schwab has access to external funding the need for shortterm borrowings from external debt facilities arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements scheduled liquidation of interestearning investments movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements and general corporate purposes we maintain policies and procedures necessary to access funding and test discount window borrowing procedures on a periodic basis 

the following table describes external debt facilities available at december 31 2019  



1 amounts available are dependent on the amount of first mortgages helocs and the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral 

2 amounts available are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral 

3 csc has authorization from its board of directors to issue commercial paper notes not to exceed 15 billion  management has set a current limit not to exceed the amount of the committed unsecured credit facility 

4 other than an overnight borrowing to test availability this facility was unused during 2019  

our banking subsidiaries maintain secured credit facilities with the fhlb amounts available under these facilities are dependent on the value of our first mortgages helocs and the fair value of certain of our investment securities that are pledged as collateral these credit facilities are also available as backup financing in the event the outflow of client cash from the banking subsidiaries’ respective balance sheets is greater than maturities and paydowns on investment securities and bank loans 

our banking subsidiaries also have access to shortterm secured funding through the federal reserve discount window amounts available under the federal reserve discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral 

csc has a commercial paper program of which proceeds are used for general corporate purposes the maturities of the commercial paper notes may vary but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue csc’s ratings for these shortterm borrowings were p1 by moody’s a1 by standard  poor’s and f1 by fitch at december 31 2019 and 2018 and csc had no commercial paper notes outstanding at december 31 2019 or 2018

the financial covenants for the 750 million committed credit facility require csco to maintain a minimum net capital ratio all bank subsidiaries to be well capitalized and csc to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity adjusted to exclude aoci at december 31 2019  the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was 160 billion csc’s stockholders’ equity excluding aoci at december 31 2019 was 217 billion  management believes these restrictions will not have a material effect on csc’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements 

to partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the options clearing corporation csco has unsecured standby letter of credit agreements locs with several banks in favor of the options clearing corporation aggregating 20 million at december 31 2019  there were no funds drawn under any of these locs during 2019 or 2018  in connection with its securities lending activities the company is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients the collateral requirements were satisfied by providing cash as collateral

schwab seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of our business strategy including anticipated balance sheet growth providing financial support to our subsidiaries and sustained access to the capital markets while at the same time meeting our regulatory capital requirements and serving as a source of financial strength to our banking subsidiaries schwab’s primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of subsidiaries and securities issuances by csc in the capital markets to ensure that schwab has sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values we have adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios our capital management in coming quarters will incorporate preparations for closing the usaaimco transaction including the allocation of capital to support client cash that will be added to our balance sheet 

internal guidelines are set for both csc and its regulated subsidiaries to ensure capital levels are in line with our strategy and regulatory requirements capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at assetliability management and pricing committee and financial risk oversight committee meetings a number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify potential problems that could impact capital in addition we monitor the subsidiaries’ capital levels and requirements subject to regulatory capital requirements and any required approvals any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to csc in the form of dividends and returns of capital when subsidiaries have need of additional capital funds are provided by csc as equity investments and also as subordinated loans in a form approved as regulatory capital by regulators for csco the details and method used for each cash infusion are based on an analysis of the particular entity’s needs and financing alternatives the amounts and structure of infusions must take into consideration maintenance of regulatory capital requirements debtequity ratios and equity double leverage ratios 

schwab conducts regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various adverse macroeconomic and companyspecific events to which the company could be subjected the objective of the capital stress testing is 1 to explore various potential outcomes – including rare and extreme events and 2 to assess impacts of potential stressful outcomes on both capital and liquidity additionally we have a comprehensive capital contingency plan to provide action plans for certain low probabilityhigh impact capital events that the company might face the capital contingency plan is issued under the authority of the financial risk oversight committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events it does not specifically address every contingency but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress the results of the stress testing indicate there are two scenarios which could stress the company’s capital 1 inflows of balance sheet cash during a period of very low interest rates and 2 outflows of balance sheet cash when other sources of financing are not available and the company is required to sell assets to fund the flows at a loss the capital contingency plan is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate

regulatory capital requirements 

csc is subject to capital requirements set by the federal reserve and is required to serve as a source of strength for our banking subsidiaries and to provide financial assistance if our banking subsidiaries experience financial distress schwab is required to maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio for csc of at least 4 however management seeks to maintain a ratio of at least 6 due to the relatively low risk of our balance sheet assets and riskbased capital ratios at csc and csb that are well in excess of regulatory requirements the tier 1 leverage ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on csc’s asset growth 

our banking subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements set by their regulators that are substantially similar to those imposed on csc by the federal reserve our banking subsidiaries’ failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that could have a direct material effect on the banks schwab’s principal banking subsidiary csb is required to maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 to be well capitalized but seeks to maintain a ratio of at least 625 based on its regulatory capital ratios at december 31 2019  csb is considered well capitalized 

the following table details the capital ratios for csc consolidated and csb 



1 beginning in 2019 csc and csb were required to include all components of aoci in regulatory capital and report our supplementary leverage ratio which is calculated as tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure total leverage exposure includes all onbalance sheet assets and certain offbalance sheet exposures including unused commitments prior to 2019 csc and csb elected to optout of the requirement to include most components of aoci in common equity tier 1 capital the amounts and ratios for december 31 2018 are presented on this basis in the interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules adopted in october 2019 category iii banking organizations such as csc were given the ability to optout of the inclusion of aoci in regulatory capital and csc made this optout election effective as of january 1 2020 see business – regulation in part i item 1 for additional information on recently issued rules that impact schwab’s regulatory capital requirements

in addition to the direct holdings in foreign companies and securities issued by foreign government agencies schwab had outstanding margin loans to foreign residents of 437 million at december 31 2019  

fair value of financial instruments 

schwab uses the market approach to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value and to determine fair value disclosures see item 8 – notes 2 and 16 for more information on our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 

when available schwab uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities quoted prices for investments in exchangetraded securities represent endofday close prices published by exchanges quoted prices for money market funds and other mutual funds represent reported net asset values when utilizing market data and bidask spread we use the price within the bidask spread that best represents fair value when quoted prices in active markets do not exist prices are obtained from independent thirdparty pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets we generally obtain prices from three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value our primary thirdparty pricing service provides prices for our fixed income investments such as commercial paper certificates of deposits us government and agency securities state and municipal securities corporate debt securities assetbacked securities foreign government agency securities and nonagency commercial mortgagebacked securities such prices are based on observable trades brokerdealer quotes and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads and weightedaverage maturity for the same or similar “tobeissued” securities we compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent thirdparty pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded at december 31 2019 and 2018  we did not adjust prices received from the primary independent thirdparty pricing service 

critical accounting estimates 

the consolidated financial statements of schwab have been prepared in accordance with gaap item 8 – note 2 contains more information on our significant accounting policies made in connection with its application of these accounting principles 

while the majority of the revenues expenses assets and liabilities are not based on estimates there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on schwab’s financial position and reported financial results these critical accounting estimates are described below management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy

schwab estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate including federal state and local domestic jurisdictions and immaterial amounts owed to several foreign jurisdictions the estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statements of income in taxes on income accrued taxes are reported in other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes deferred tax assets are recognized if in management’s judgment their realizability is determined to be more likely than not uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize an uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement in estimating accrued taxes we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances 

changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates interpretations of tax laws the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities and newly enacted statutory judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions these changes when they occur affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the operating results of the company see item 8 – note 20 for more information on the company’s income taxes 

legal and regulatory reserves 

reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter after considering among other factors the progress of the case prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases available defenses and the opinions and views of legal counsel in many cases including most class action lawsuits it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred or to estimate the range of that loss until the matter is close to resolution in which case no accrual is made until that time reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved see item 8 – note 14 for more information on the company’s contingencies related to legal and regulatory reserves

unless otherwise indicated the terms “schwab” “the company” “we” “us” or “our” mean csc together with its consolidated subsidiaries 

business strategy and competitive environment 

schwab was founded on the belief that all americans deserve access to a better investing experience although much has changed in the intervening years our purpose remains clear – to champion every client’s goals with passion and integrity guided by this purpose and our vision of creating the most trusted leader in investment services management has adopted a strategy described as “through clients’ eyes” 

this strategy emphasizes placing clients’ perspectives needs and desires at the forefront because investing plays a fundamental role in building financial security we strive to deliver a better investing experience for our clients – individual investors and the people and institutions who serve them – by disrupting longstanding industry practices on their behalf and providing superior service we also aim to offer a broad range of products and solutions to meet client needs with a focus on transparency value and trust in addition management works to couple schwab’s scale and resources with ongoing expense discipline to keep costs low and ensure that products and solutions are affordable as well as responsive to client needs in combination these are the key elements of our “no tradeoffs” approach to serving investors we believe that following this strategy is the best way to maximize our market valuation and stockholder returns over time 

management estimates that investable wealth in the united states us consisting of assets in defined contribution retail wealth management and brokerage and registered investment advisor channels along with bank deposits currently exceeds 45 trillion which means the company’s 325 trillion  in client assets leaves substantial opportunity for growth our strategy is based on the principle that developing trusted relationships will translate into more assets from both new and

the charles schwab corporation 

existing clients ultimately driving more revenue and along with expense discipline and thoughtful capital management will generate earnings growth and build longterm stockholder value 

within investor services our competition in serving individual investors spans brokerage wealth management and asset management firms as well as banks and trust companies in the advisor services arena we compete with institutional custodians traditional and discount brokers banks and trust companies 

across both segments our key competitive advantages are 

 

sources of net revenues 

our major sources of net revenues are net interest revenue asset management and administration fees and trading revenue these revenue streams are supported by the combination of bank brokerdealer and asset management operating subsidiaries each of which brings specific capabilities that enable us to provide clients with the products and services they are looking for 

net interest revenue is the difference between interest generated on interestearning assets and interest paid on funding sources the majority of which is derived from client cash balances awaiting investment held by schwab as part of clients’ overall relationship with the company while certain of these client cash balances are held on csco’s balance sheet or swept to our money market funds a substantial amount of existing balances – and most new inflows of cash awaiting investment – are swept to a banking subsidiary interestearning assets are primarily comprised of highquality fixed income securities margin loans and bank loans 

the majority of asset management and administration fees are earned from proprietary money market mutual funds proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds and exchangetraded funds etfs and feebased advisory solutions 

trading revenue includes commissions earned for executing trades for clients in individual equities options futures fixed income securities and certain thirdparty mutual funds and etfs as well as principal transaction revenue earned primarily from actions to support client trading in fixed income securities 

products and services 

we offer a broad range of products through intuitive endtoend solutions including robust digital capabilities to address our clients’ varying investment and financial needs examples of these product offerings include the following

risk factors 

tableend 

we face a variety of risks that may affect our operations financial results or stock price and many of those risks are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict the following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant although there may be other risks that could arise or may prove to be more significant than expected that may affect our operations or financial results 

for a discussion of our risk management including operational risk compliance risk credit risk market risk and liquidity risk see risk management and capital management in part ii item 7 

developments in the business economic and geopolitical environment could negatively impact our business 

our business can be adversely affected by the general environment – economic corporate securities market regulatory and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations trading activity interest rates and overall investor engagement and are outside of our control deterioration in the housing and credit markets reduction in shortterm interest rates and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact our results of operations and capital resources 

extensive regulation of our businesses may subject us to significant penalties   or limitations on business activities 

as a participant in the securities banking and financial services industries we are subject to extensive regulation under federal state and foreign laws by governmental agencies supervisory authorities and sros the costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase these regulations affect our business operations and impose capital client protection and market conduct requirements on us 

in addition to specific banking laws and regulations our banking regulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies and could require csc andor our banking subsidiaries to hold more capital increase liquidity or limit their ability to pay dividends or csc’s ability to repurchase or redeem shares the banking regulators could also limit our ability to grow including adding assets launching new products making acquisitions and undertaking strategic investments other potential regulatory actions include limiting our banking subsidiaries’ ability to accept deposits swept from client brokerage accounts and brokered deposits and preventing us from pursuing our business strategy 

despite our efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements there are a number of risks particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by our regulators against us or our affiliates officers or employees could result in fines penalties cease and desist orders enforcement actions suspension disqualification or expulsion or other disciplinary sanctions including limitations on our business activities any of which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

while we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations violations could occur in addition some legalregulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time there may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance including restrictions on certain activities such a finding may also damage our reputation and our relationships with our regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities

legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect our business and financial results 

new legislation rules regulations and guidance or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal state foreign and sro rules regulations and guidance including changes relating to mutual funds brokerdealer fiduciary duties and regulatory treatment of deposit accounts may directly affect the operation and profitability of schwab or its specific business lines our profitability could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally including changes to the laws governing taxation electronic commerce client privacy and security of client data in addition the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct modifications to our business practices more stringent capital and liquidity requirements increased deposit insurance assessments or additional costs and could limit our ability to return capital to stockholders these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance risk management treasury and operations functions 

failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect our financial condition 

csc together with its banking and brokerdealer subsidiaries must meet certain capital and liquidity standards subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of schwab’s capital and schwab’s internal assessment of its capital needs the uniform net capital rule limits csco’s ability to transfer capital to csc and other affiliates new regulatory capital liquidity and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital including paying dividends stock repurchases and redemptions and may require us to increase our capital andor liquidity or to limit our growth failure by either csc or its banking subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have a negative impact on us in addition failure by csc or our banking subsidiaries to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy their capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer requirements would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as tier 1 capital or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could require us to liquidate assets deleverage or otherwise change our business andor investment plans which may adversely affect our financial results issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders 

in 2018 we crossed the threshold for becoming subject to the “advanced approaches” framework we are currently subject to a supplementary leverage ratio and related disclosure requirements the inclusion of aoci in regulatory capital and the countercyclical capital buffer and will become subject to the full lcr in the second quarter of 2019 in addition federal banking agencies have broad discretion and could require csc or its banking subsidiaries to hold higher levels of capital or increase liquidity above the applicable regulatory requirements 

significant interest rate changes could affect our profitability 

the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings a decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on our net interest revenue a low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact on our asset management and administration fee revenues if we have to waive a portion of our management fees for certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds in order to continue providing a positive return to clients 

although we believe we are positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment a rise in interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase if market conditions or the competitive environment induces us to raise our interest rates to avoid losing deposits or replace deposits with higher cost funding sources without offsetting increases in yields on interestearning assets can reduce our net interest revenue 

the expected phaseout of libor could negatively impact our net interest revenue and require significant operational work 

certain securities in our investment portfolio and the floating rate loans we offer reference libor as the benchmark rate to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount we also use libor in many of our financial models such as those used for capital stress testing and to determine the dividend rates for certain of our series of preferred stock which begin to float in 2022 and later if libor is discontinued after 2021 as expected there will be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments and 

 10   

the charles schwab corporation 

there will be significant work required to transition to using the new benchmark rates and implement necessary changes to our systems and financial models this could result in different financial performance for previously booked transactions and may impact our existing transaction data products systems operations and pricing processes the calculation of interest rates under the replacement benchmarks could also impact our net interest revenue in addition libor may perform differently during the phaseout period than in the past which could result in lower interest payments and a reduction in the value of certain securities in our investment portfolio 

a significant change in client cash allocations could negatively impact our net interest revenue 

we rely heavily on bank deposits as a low cost source of funding to extend loans to clients and purchase investment securities our bank deposits are primarily driven by our bank sweep feature when cash awaiting investment in our client brokerage accounts is swept to our banking subsidiaries a significant reduction in our clients’ allocation to cash a change in the allocation of that cash or a transfer of cash away from the company could reduce net interest revenue 

security breaches of our systems or those of our clients or third parties may subject us to significant liability and damage schwab’s reputation   

our business involves the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential information about our clients and us information security risks for financial institutions are increasing in part because of the use of the internet and mobile technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime activists hackers and other external parties including foreign state actors our systems and those of other financial institutions have been and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks malicious code computer viruses   and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access misuse loss or destruction of data including confidential client information account takeovers unavailability of service or other events despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means for example employee misconduct 

given the high volume of transactions that we process the large number of clients counterparties and thirdparty service providers with which we do business and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected the extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before an investigation is completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known during such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack 

security breaches including breaches of our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers or clients could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject us to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance actions by our regulators damage to schwab’s reputation or a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures 

we also face risk related to external fraud involving the misappropriation and use of clients’ user names passwords or other personal information to gain access to clients’ financial accounts at schwab this could occur from the compromise of clients’ personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company where clients’ personal information is taken and then made available to fraudsters such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties including foreign statesponsored parties losses reimbursed to clients under our guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

technology and operational failures or errors could subject us to losses litigation regulatory actions and reputational damage 

we must process record and monitor a large number of transactions and our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to our systems system interruptions 

 11   

the charles schwab corporation 

errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes including changes in client use patterns technological failure changes to our systems linkages with thirdparty systems and power failures and can have a significant impact on our business and operations our systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error execution errors errors in models such as those used for asset management capital planning and management risk management stress testing and compliance employee misconduct unauthorized trading external fraud computer viruses distributed denial of service attacks cyber attacks terrorist attacks natural disaster power outage capacity constraints software flaws events impacting key business partners and vendors and similar events for example schwab and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have in certain circumstances made websites mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time it could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to our technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence which could affect our ability to process and settle client transactions moreover instances of fraud or other misconduct might also negatively impact schwab’s reputation and client confidence in the company in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances despite our efforts to identify areas of risk oversee operational areas involving risk and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks there can be no assurance that we will not suffer unexpected losses reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors including those of our vendors or other third parties 

while we devote substantial attention and resources to the reliability capacity and scalability of our systems extraordinary trading volumes could cause our computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail affecting our ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients’ orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses and decreased client satisfaction we are also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges clearing houses and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement system failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices cause substantial losses for us and for our clients and subject us to claims from our clients for damages 

  

our investment management operations may subject us to fiduciary or other legal liability for client losses 

fund and trust management and administration are complex activities and include functions such as recordkeeping and accounting security pricing corporate actions compliance with investment restrictions daily net asset value computations account reconciliations and required distributions to fund shareholders failure to properly perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of our services and products could subject us to regulatory sanctions penalties or litigation and result in reputational damage liability to clients and the termination of investment management or administration agreements and the withdrawal of assets under our management 

in the management and administration of funds and client accounts we use quantitative models and other tools and resources to support investment decisions and processes including those related to risk assessment portfolio management trading and hedging activities and product valuations errors in the design function or underlying assumptions used in these models and tools particularly if we fail to detect the errors over an extended period could subject us to claims of a breach of fiduciary duty and potentially large liabilities for makewhole payments litigation andor regulatory fines 

a significant decrease in our liquidity could negatively affect our business as well as reduce client confidence in schwab 

maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our business operations including transaction settlement custody requirements and lending commitments among other liquidity needs we meet our liquidity needs primarily from working capital and cash generated by client activity as well as external financing fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances as well as market conditions or changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits may affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs a reduction in our liquidity position could reduce client confidence in schwab which could result in the transfer of client assets and accounts or could cause us to fail to satisfy our liquidity requirements including the lcr in addition if our brokerdealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to csc which could reduce csc’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt pay dividends on csc’s preferred stock or return capital to common stockholders in addition csc may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries 

factors which may adversely affect our liquidity position include csco having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances fluctuations in cash 

 12   

the charles schwab corporation 

held in banking or brokerage client accounts a dramatic increase in our lending activities including margin mortgagerelated and personal lending increased capital requirements changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations other regulatory changes or a loss of market or client confidence in schwab resulting in unanticipated withdrawals of client funds 

when available cash is not sufficient for our liquidity needs we may seek external financing during periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets potential sources of external financing could be reduced and borrowing costs could increase although csc and csco maintain committed and uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines and csc has a commercial paper issuance program as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec which can be used to sell securities financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets in addition a significant downgrade in the company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets 

we may suffer significant losses from our credit exposures 

our businesses are subject to the risk that a client counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate while we have policies and procedures designed to manage this risk the policies and procedures may not be fully effective our exposure mainly results from margin lending clients’ options and futures trading securities lending mortgage lending pledged asset lending our role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds we sponsor 

when clients purchase securities on margin borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities or trade options or futures we are subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients’ indebtedness abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses 

we have exposure to credit risk associated with our investments those investments are subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial market’s assessment of credit quality loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such securities are other than temporarily impaired the evaluation of whether otherthantemporary impairment otti exists is a matter of judgment which includes the assessment of several factors if management determines that a security is otti the cost basis of the security may be adjusted and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings deterioration in the performance of available for sale afs and held to maturity htm securities could result in the recognition of future impairment charges even if a security is not considered otti if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs we would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time 

  

our bank loans primarily consist of first mortgages helocs and pals increases in delinquency and default rates housing and stock price declines increases in the unemployment rate and other economic factors can result in charges for loan loss reserves and write downs on such loans 

heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments can increase our risk of loss examples include 

 

we sponsor a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds although we have no obligation to do so we may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit liquidity or other support to our funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity such support could cause us to take significant charges could reduce our liquidity and in certain situations could with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds result in us having to consolidate one or more 

 13   

the charles schwab corporation 

funds in our financial statements if we choose not to provide credit liquidity or other support in such a situation schwab could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected 

we are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending against claims or proceedings 

the financial services industry faces significant litigation and regulatory risks we are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business including arbitrations class actions and other litigation some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages we are also the subject of inquiries investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies 

litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by our clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied at schwab claims from clients of third party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors’ misconduct litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights eg patents such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources if we were found to have infringed on a thirdparty patent or other intellectual property rights we could incur substantial damages and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology or providing certain products or services 

actions brought against us may result in settlements awards injunctions fines penalties or other results adverse to us including reputational harm even if we are successful in defending against these actions the defense of such matters may result in us incurring significant expenses a substantial judgment settlement fine or penalty could be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular future period depending on our results for that period in market downturns and periods of heightened volatility the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased 

we rely on outsourced service providers to perform key functions 

we rely on external service providers to perform certain key technology processing servicing and support functions these service providers face technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information could cause us to incur losses and could harm schwab’s reputation an interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints financial difficulties or for any other reason and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in financial losses to us switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations 

  

potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on our financial position 

we evaluate potential strategic transactions including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions any such transaction could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows the process of evaluating negotiating and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert management’s attention from other business concerns and might cause the loss of key clients employees and business partners moreover integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties including the need to integrate operational financial and management information systems and management controls integrate relationships with clients and business partners and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas in addition an acquisition may cause us to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings further we may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition and any future acquisition could be dilutive to our current stockholders’ percentage ownership or to earnings per common share eps 

our acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business operations or financial condition of the entity being acquired or sold to the extent we enter into an agreement to buy or sell an entity there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected or at all if a material transaction does not close our stock price could decline 

 14   

the charles schwab corporation 

our industry is characterized by aggressive price competition 

we continually monitor our pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjust trade commission rates interest rates on deposits and loans fees for advisory services expense ratios on mutual funds and etfs and other pricing to enhance our competitive position increased price competition from other financial services firms to attract clients such as reduced commissions higher deposit rates or reduced mutual fund or etf expense ratios could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

we face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees 

the market for qualified personnel in our business is highly competitive at various times different functions and roles are in especially high demand in the market compelling us to pay more to attract talent our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs 

our stock price has fluctuated historically and may continue to fluctuate 

our stock price can be volatile among the factors that may affect the volatility of our stock price are the following 

 

changes in the stock market generally or as it concerns our industry as well as geopolitical corporate regulatory business and economic factors may also affect our stock price 

future sales of csc’s equity securities may adversely affect the market price of csc’s common stock and result in dilution 

csc’s certificate of incorporation authorizes csc’s board of directors among other things to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities without stockholder approval 

csc may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes the issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of csc’s common stock and may adversely affect the market price of csc’s common stock

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

overview 

management focuses on several client activity and financial metrics in evaluating schwab’s financial position and operating performance we believe that metrics relating to net new and total client assets as well as client cash levels and utilization of advisory services offer perspective on our business momentum and client engagement data on new and total client brokerage accounts provides additional perspective on our ability to attract and retain new business total net revenue growth pretax profit margin eps return on average common stockholders’ equity and the consolidated tier 1 leverage ratio provide broad indicators of schwab’s overall financial health operating efficiency and ability to generate acceptable returns total expenses excluding interest as a percentage of average client assets is a measure of operating efficiency results for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  are as follows 



1   2018 includes outflows of 939 billion from certain mutual fund clearing services clients 2017 includes inflows of 345 billion from certain mutual fund clearing services clients 

2018  compared to 2017   

net income increased by 12 billion  or 49  in 2018 driven primarily by business momentum a supportive economic environment for much of the year and lower corporate tax rates continued execution of our ‘through clients’ eyes’ strategy helped us succeed with clients in 2018 clients opened 16 million  new brokerage accounts helping bring active brokerage accounts to 116 million  at the end of the year and core net new assets totaled 2278 billion  up 15  from the 2017 total our strong net new assets largely offset lower market valuations and we ended 2018 at 325 trillion  in total client assets 

total net revenue grew by 15 billion  or 18  in 2018 primarily due to an increase of 15 billion  or 36  in net interest revenue the fed raised the overnight federal funds target interest rate four times in 2018 for a total of 100 basis points the growth of total net revenue resulted from higher interest rates due to the fed’s rate normalization and also from higher

interestearning assets which reflect both client cash allocations and the transfer of sweep money market funds to bank and brokerdealer sweep as we progressed with these transfers the corresponding money market fund asset management and administration fee revenue naturally declined yet positive inflows in advice solutions schwab equity and bond funds and etfs and other thirdparty mutual funds and etfs kept asset management fees at 32 billion  limiting the decrease to 5  from 2017 record trading activity from our clients resulted in trading revenue reaching 763 million  an increase of 17  from the prior year 

our increase in total expenses excluding interest of 602 million  or 12  reflected our 2018 investments to support and fuel our business growth including hiring additional clientfacing and other employees and technology project spending as well as an increase in marketing and a special stock award of 36 million to our employees even with these increases expenses as a percentage of client assets remained consistent at 16 basis points  and pretax income increased 25  to 46 billion  in 2018 resulting in a pretax profit margin of 450  as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act taxes on income decreased 19  in 2018 resulting in an effective tax rate of 231  overall we generated a 19  return on equity and diluted eps of 245  for the year 

during 2018 the board of directors raised the quarterly cash dividend 63  to 013  per share and authorized a 10 billion share repurchase program which we completed during the fourth quarter these actions reflected the company’s strong financial performance and our confidence in its longterm success they also demonstrated that effective capital management at schwab can support both healthy business growth and more meaningful capital returns to stockholders 

2017  compared to 2016   

net income available to common stockholders rose in 2017 by 434 million or 25 from the prior year resulting in diluted eps of 161 in 2017 – an increase of 23 compared to 131 in 2016 net revenues improved by 11 billion or 15 while expenses excluding interest increased 483 million or 11 compared to 2016 

our steady focus on operating ‘through clients’ eyes’ and our goal to continually challenge the status quo helped schwab achieve another strong growth year in 2017 clients opened 14 million new brokerage accounts in 2017 and trusted schwab with 1986 billion of core net new assets in 2017 up 58 from 2016 total assets receiving ongoing advisory services grew 21 in 2017 to 170 trillion our success with clients was bolstered by strength in the equity markets – the standard  poor’s 500 ®  index sp 500 finished 2017 up 19 from the prior year end also in 2017 the federal reserve increased the overnight federal funds target interest rate three times for a total of 75 basis points strong client activity and the positive economic environment resulted in total client assets rising to 336 trillion as of december 31 2017 – a 21 increase since the end of 2016 

schwab’s 2017 financial results demonstrate the power of our financial formula working as designed our robust business growth supported strong revenue growth through multiple sources in 2017 which we combined with continued expense discipline to drive significantly improved profitability 

net revenues grew by 15 in 2017 compared to 2016 through contributions from our two largest revenue sources net interest revenue rose 29 while asset management and administration fees grew 11 in 2017 when compared to the prior year trading revenue declined in 2017 by 21 due to price reductions announced early in 2017 

consistent with our expectations expenses grew 11 in 2017 compared to the prior year this increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation and higher staffing related to our strong asset gathering as well as expenses related to project spending and thirdparty fees tied to higher balances in our asset management business 

this combination of revenue growth and expense discipline drove the pretax profit margin to 424 – an increase of 240 basis points over the prior year earnings before income taxes rose 22 to 37 billion in 2017 compared to 30 billion in the prior year 

the effective tax rate in 2017 was 355 compared to 369 in 2016 reflecting the benefit from the adoption of new accounting standards requiring the recognition of a portion of tax deductions related to equity compensation partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and other tax adjustments associated with the 2017 enactment of the tax act

subsequent event 

on january 30 2019 csc publicly announced that its board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to 40 billion of common stock and declared a four cent or 31 increase in the quarterly cash dividend to 017 per common share the share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date   

current regulatory environment and other developments 

on october 31 2018 the federal reserve issued a notice of proposed rulemaking and the federal reserve the occ and the fdic jointly issued another notice of proposed rulemaking the two proposals would establish a revised framework for applying enhanced prudential standards to large us banking organizations with four categories of standards that reflect the risks of banking organizations in each group csc would be in category iii based on having 250 billion – 700 billion in total assets  

the federal reserve proposal which would make large savings and loan holding companies such as csc subject to enhanced prudential standards would tailor those regulatory requirements relating to capital stress testing risk management liquidity risk management and singlecounterparty credit limits based on the category of the banking organization the proposal provides that category iii banking organizations would be subject to annual supervisory stress testing and biennial companyrun stress testing the interagency proposal would similarly tailor requirements under the agencies’ capital rule lcr rule and the proposed net stable funding ratio rule for banking organizations in each category under the proposal banking organizations in category iii would not be required to calculate their riskweighted assets using the “advanced approaches” framework or to include aoci in calculating their regulatory capital however they would continue to be subject to the supplementary leverage ratio and any future countercyclical capital buffer imposed by the banking agencies 

although the federal reserve announced in its proposal that additional capital planning and resolution planning proposals would be issued at a later date the agency did indicate that all category iii firms including savings and loan holding companies would be required to submit annual capital plans that would be subject to qualitative and quantitative assessments evaluated as part of the ccar process 

the comment period for both proposed rules ended on january 22 2019 and   the impact to schwab cannot be assessed until the final rule is released 

on december 22 2017 pl11597 the tax act was signed into law and became effective on january 1 2018 among other things the tax act lowered the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 

as a result of the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap require companies to remeasure their deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of the date of enactment with the resulting tax effects accounted for in the reporting period of enactment schwab recorded a onetime noncash charge to taxes on income associated with the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and other tax adjustments related to the tax reform legislation in the fourth quarter of 2017 our 2018 effective income tax rate was reduced as a result of these changes 

in may 2016 the federal reserve the occ and the fdic jointly issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would impose a minimum nsfr on certain banking organizations including csc the comment period for the proposed rule ended on august 5 2016 and the impact to the company cannot be assessed until the final rule is released

results of operations 

total net revenues 

total net revenues of 101 billion  and 86 billion  for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively represented growth of 18  and 15  from the prior periods primarily due to increases in net interest revenue 



net interest revenue 

schwab’s primary interestearning assets include cash and cash equivalents cash and investments segregated margin loans which constitute the majority of receivables from brokerage clients investment securities and bank loans revenue on interestearning assets is affected by various factors such as the composition of assets prevailing interest rates at the time of origination or purchase changes in interest rates on floating rate securities and loans and changes in prepayment levels for mortgagerelated securities and loans fees earned on securities borrowing and lending activities which are conducted by csco using assets held in client brokerage accounts are included in other interest revenue and expense 

schwab’s interestbearing liabilities include bank deposits payables to brokerage clients shortterm borrowings and longterm debt we establish the rates paid on clientrelated liabilities and management expects that it will generally adjust the rates paid on these liabilities at some fraction of any movement in shortterm rates during 2018  these liabilities rose by a total of 633 billion  largely reflecting the effect of our transferring a total of 72 billion  sweep money market funds to bank and brokerdealer sweep clients choosing to reallocate assets between cash equities fixed income and other investments and the company gathering additional flows from new and current clients 

overall management believes that the extended period of extraordinarily low interest rates running from the financial crisis until recently has likely resulted in certain sweep cash balances retaining some level of latent rate sensitivity with the federal funds target rate having increased to 225 – 250 management expects some sweep cash balances could migrate to alternatives including purchased money market funds that offer higher yields to clients but lower revenue to schwab 

given the general stability and relatively low rate sensitivity of clientrelated liabilities management believes their duration is at least several years we have positioned schwab to benefit from an increase in interest rates especially shortterm interest rates by managing the duration of interestearning assets to be shorter than that of interestbearing liabilities so that asset yields are expected to move faster than liability costs

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted 

in order to keep interestrate sensitivity within established limits management monitors and responds to changes in the balance sheet as schwab builds its client base we attract new client sweep cash which along with the transfers of existing sweep cash balances from money market funds is a primary driver of balance sheet growth by managing the duration of interestearning assets as necessary we are positioned to continue to gain from increasing rates while limiting exposure to falling rates to an acceptable level approximately half of our interest earning assets reprice or reset based on shortterm interest rates such as onemonth libor 

noninterestbearing funding sources include certain cash balances stockholders’ equity and other miscellaneous assets and liabilities 

the following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interestearning assets and funding sources on the consolidated balance sheets 



1   amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost 

net interest revenue increased 15 billion  or 36  in 2018  from 2017  and 960 million  or 29  in 2017  from 2016  primarily due to higher interest rates and growth in interestearning assets 

our net interest margin improved 32 basis points to 229  in 2018 primarily as a result of the federal reserve’s 2017 and 2018 interest rate increases partially offset by higher interest rates paid on bank deposits and other interestbearing liabilities our net interest margin was 197  in 2017  representing an improvement of 24 basis points compared to 2016  primarily due to the federal reserve’s interest rate increases in 2016 and 2017 

average interest earning assets grew 16  and 14  during 2018 and 2017 respectively compared with the sequential prior years these increases primarily reflect higher bank deposits due to transfers from sweep money market funds to bank sweep balances as well as changes in client cash allocations partially offset by client purchases of other assets 

in march 2017 247 billion  of debt securities were transferred from the afs category to the htm category the transfer had no effect on the overall net interest margin for additional information on the transfer see item 8 – note 6

asset management and administration fees 

asset management and administration fees include mutual fund and etf service fees and fees for other assetbased financial services provided to individual and institutional clients schwab earns mutual fund and etf service fees for shareholder services administration and investment management provided to its proprietary funds and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to thirdparty funds asset management and administration fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds and do not include securities lending revenues earned by proprietary mutual funds and etfs as those amounts net of program fees are credited to the fund shareholders the fair values of client assets included in proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds and etfs are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data 

we also earn asset management fees for advice solutions which include managed portfolios specialized strategies and customized investment advice other asset management and administration fees include various assetbased fees such as trust fees 401k recordkeeping fees mutual fund clearing fees collective trust fund fees and nonbalance based service and transaction fees 

asset management and administration fees vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity 

the following table presents asset management and administration fees average client assets and average fee yields 



1   includes schwab etf onesource ™  

2   beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017 a change was made to add nonfee based average assets from managed portfolios average client assets for advice solutions may also include the asset balances contained in the mutual fund andor etf categories listed above prior periods have been adjusted to accommodate this change 

3   includes various assetrelated fees such as trust fees 401k recordkeeping fees and mutual fund clearing fees and other service fees beginning in the first quarter of 2017 a prospective methodology change was made to average client assets relating to 401k recordkeeping fees to provide improved insight into the associated fee driver which resulted in an increase of approximately 25 billion there was no impact to revenue or the average fee 

4   includes miscellaneous service and transaction fees relating to mutual funds and etfs that are not balancebased 

asset management and administration fees decreased by 163 million  or 5  in 2018  from 2017  primarily due to lower money market fund revenue as a result of transfers to bank sweep client asset allocation choices and our 2017 fee reductions part of the decline was offset by revenue from growing asset balances in advice solutions schwab equity and bond funds and etfs and other thirdparty mutual funds and etfs

the charles schwab corporation 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted 

asset management and administration fees increased by 337 million  or 11  in 2017  from 2016  due to higher average client assets invested in advice solutions mutual funds and etfs and lower fee waivers on money market funds partially offsetting these increases were lower fee rates on proprietary money funds and other indexed mutual funds and etfs due to fee reductions implemented by schwab in 2017 

the following table presents a roll forward of client assets for the schwab money market funds schwab equity and bond funds and etfs and mutual fund onesource ®  and other nontransaction fee ntf funds the following funds generated 47 53 and 53 of the asset management and administration fees earned during 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 



1   includes net inflows from other thirdparty mutual funds to mutual fund onesource ® in the second quarter of 2017 

trading revenue 

trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues commission revenue is affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from trading activity in fixed income securities with clients to accommodate clients’ fixed income trading activity schwab maintains positions in fixed income securities including us state and municipal debt obligations us government and corporate debt and other securities the difference between the price at which the company buys and sells securities to and from its clients and other brokerdealers is recognized as principal transaction revenue principal transaction revenue also includes adjustments to the fair value of these securities positions 

the following table presents trading revenue and the related drivers 



trading revenue increased by 109 million  or 17  in 2018  compared to 2017 dart volumes increased 31  in 2018 which more than offset schwab’s commission pricing reductions implemented in the first quarter of 2017 trading revenue decreased by 171 million  in 2017  from 2016 primarily due to lower commissions rates on darts 

during the first quarter of 2017 we announced two trading price reductions which lowered standard equity etf and option trade commissions from 895 to 495 and lowered the per contract option fee from 75 to 65 these reductions in commission rates reflect our continuing belief that pricing should never be an obstacle for choosing schwab and our commitment to share the benefits of scale with clients 

with these changes trading revenue has declined from a peak of 5060 of total revenue in the early 1990’s to the current low of 8  in 2018  8 in 2017  and 11 in 2016  

other revenue 

other revenue includes order flow revenue other service fees software fees from our portfolio management solutions exchange processing fees and nonrecurring gains order flow revenue was 139 million  during 2018  114 million  for 2017  and 103 million in 2016  these increases were primarily due to higher rebate rates received on certain types of

orders and higher volume of trades in 2016 other revenue also included net litigation proceeds of 16 million related to our nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities portfolios 

total expenses excluding interest 

the following table shows a comparison of total expenses excluding interest 



໿ 

expenses excluding interest increased in 2018  and 2017  from the prior years by 12  and 11  respectively the largest drivers of the increase in both years were compensation and benefits and professional services 

total compensation and benefits increased in 2018  and 2017  from prior years primarily due to increases in employee headcount to support our expanding client base additionally in 2018  nonofficer employees were issued special stock awards totaling 36 million  

professional services expense increased in 2018  and 2017  from the prior years primarily due to higher spending on technology projects as well as an increase in asset management and administration related expenses resulting from growth in the schwab funds ®  and schwab etfs™ 

occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2018  and 2017  from the prior years primarily due to an increase in software maintenance expenses and additional licenses to support growth in the business 

advertising and market development expense rose in 2018  primarily reflecting management’s decision to increase television advertising and digital media spending in the fourth quarter 

depreciation and amortization expenses grew in 2018  and 2017  from the prior years primarily due to higher amortization of internally developed software associated with our investments in software and technology enhancements

the charles schwab corporation 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted 

regulatory fees assessments increased in 2018  and 2017  from the prior years due to an increase in fdic insurance assessments which rose as a result of higher average assets in deposit balances this increase in 2018 was partially offset by the elimination of the fdic surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018  

other expenses increased in 2018  from 2017  due to travel and entertainment and miscellaneous items due to overall growth in our business other expenses increased in 2017  from 2016  due to travel and entertainment asset volumerelated increases and some miscellaneous items 

capital expenditures were 576 million  412 million  and 353 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the increase in capital expenditures in both 2018  and 2017  from the prior years was primarily due to the expansion of our campuses in the us and investments in technology projects the largest component of capital expenditures in 2018  was investment in buildings of 253 million  capitalized costs for developing internaluse software totaled 167 million  157 million  and 130 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively our capital expenditures for 2018 came in at the lower end of our estimated range of 67 of total net revenues largely due to the timing of our campus expansion work as we carry this work forward in 2019 and invest further in technology projects we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will reach approximately 79 of total net revenues our longer term expectation for capital expenditures remains in the range of 35 of total net revenues 

taxes on income 

as previously discussed under current regulatory environment and other developments the tax act was signed into law during 2017 among other things the tax act lowered the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning in 2018 

also as a result of the tax act schwab recognized a 46 million  onetime noncash charge to taxes on income in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and other tax adjustments related to the tax act 

effective january 1 2017 schwab adopted accounting standards update asu 201609 which prospectively changed the accounting treatment of a portion of the tax deductions relating to equity compensation these deductions were previously reflected directly in additional paidin capital a component of stockholders’ equity and are now included in taxes on income a component of net income as a result of this change our tax expense was reduced by approximately 46 million  and 87 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively future effects will depend on our share price restricted stock vesting and the volume of equity incentive options exercised 

schwab’s effective income tax rate on income before taxes was 231  in 2018  355  in 2017  and 369  in 2016 the decrease in rates over this threeyear time period was primarily due to the net impact of the above items 

segment information 

schwab provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments – investor services and advisor services the investor services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services retirement plan services and other corporate brokerage services to individual investors the advisor services segment provides custodial trading banking and support services as well as retirement business services to independent rias independent retirement advisors and recordkeepers revenues and expenses are attributed to the two segments based on which segment services the client management evaluates the performance of the segments on a pretax basis segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments net revenues in both segments are generated from the underlying client assets and trading activity differences in the composition of net revenues between the segments are based on the composition of client assets client trading frequency and pricing unique to each while both segments leverage the scale and efficiency of our platforms segment expenses reflect the dynamics of serving millions of clients in investor services versus the thousands of rias on the advisor platform

risk management 

schwab’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks including operational credit market liquidity and compliance risks the company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact despite our efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures there can be no assurance that schwab will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks 

our risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment risk measurement risk monitoring and reporting and risk mitigation the activities and governance that comprise the risk management process are described below 

culture 

the board of directors has approved an enterprise risk management erm framework that incorporates our purpose vision and values which form the bedrock of our corporate culture and set the tone for the organization 

we designed the erm framework to enable a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered by schwab in its business activities the framework incorporates key concepts commensurate with the size risk profile complexity and continuing growth of the company risk appetite which is defined as the amount of risk the company is willing to accept in pursuit of its corporate strategy is developed by executive management and approved by the board of directors 

risk governance 

senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying measuring and controlling risks 

the global risk committee which is comprised of senior executives from each major business and control function is responsible for the oversight of risk management this includes identifying emerging risks assessing risk management practices and the control environment reinforcing business accountability for risk management supervisory controls and regulatory compliance supporting resource prioritization across the organization and escalating significant issues to the board of directors 

we have established risk metrics and reporting that enable measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite the risk metrics with risk limits and tolerance levels are established for key risk categories by the global risk committee and its functional risk subcommittees 

the chief risk officer regularly reports activities of the global risk committee to the risk committee of the board of directors the board risk committee in turn assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to our risk management program including approving risk appetite statements and related key risk appetite metrics and reviewing reports relating to risk issues from functional areas of risk management legal compliance and internal audit 

functional risk subcommittees focusing on specific areas of risk report to the global risk committee these subcommittees include the

senior management has also created an incentive compensation risk oversight committee which establishes policy and reviews and approves the annual risk assessment of incentive compensation plans and reports directly to the compensation committee of the board of directors 

the company’s compliance finance internal audit legal and corporate risk management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating testing and monitoring risk management 

in addition the disclosure committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter the disclosure committee reports on this evaluation to the ceo and cfo prior to their certification required by sections 302 and 906 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 

operational risk 

operational risks arise due to potential inadequacies or failures related to people internal processes and systems or from external events or relationships impacting the company andor any of its key business partners and third parties while operational risk is inherent in all business activities we rely on a system of internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep operational risk and operational losses within the company’s risk appetite we have specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk and use periodic risk and control selfassessments control testing programs and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls where appropriate we manage the impact of operational loss and litigation expense through the purchase of insurance the insurance program is specifically designed to address our key operational risks and to maintain compliance with local laws and regulation 

schwab’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of our critical business functions and technology systems to the extent schwab experiences business or system interruptions errors or downtime which could result from a variety of causes including natural disasters terrorist attacks technological failure cyber attacks changes to systems linkages with thirdparty systems and power failures our business and operations could be negatively impacted to minimize business interruptions and ensure the capacity to continue operations during an incident regardless of duration schwab maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure which includes facilities for backup and communications a geographically dispersed workforce and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans and a wellestablished incident management program

compliance risk 

schwab faces compliance risk which is the potential exposure to legal or regulatory sanctions fines or penalties financial loss or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with laws regulations rules or other regulatory requirements among other things compliance risks relate to the suitability of client investments conflicts of interest disclosure obligations and performance expectations for products and services supervision of employees and the adequacy of our controls the company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal state and foreign regulatory authorities including sros 

we manage compliance risk through policies procedures and controls reasonably designed to achieve andor monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements these procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics sales and trading practices marketing and communications extension of credit client funds and securities books and records antimoney laundering client privacy and employment policies 

fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client fiduciary activities include but are not limited to individual and institutional trust investment management custody and cash and securities processing we manage this risk by establishing policy and procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the policy and procedures applicable to their business guidance and control are provided through the creation approval and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees 

credit risk 

credit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower counterparty or issuer failing to perform on its contractual obligations our exposure to credit risk mainly results from investing activities in our liquidity and investment portfolios mortgage lending margin lending and client option and futures activities pledged asset lending securities lending activities and our role as a counterparty in other financial contracts to manage the risks of such losses we have established policies and procedures which include establishing and reviewing credit limits monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties and adjusting margin pal option and futures requirements for certain securities and instruments 

liquidity and investment portfolios 

schwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios which include us agency and nonagency mortgagebacked securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities us agency notes us treasury securities certificates of deposit us state and municipal securities commercial paper and foreign government agency securities 

at december 31 2018 substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade us agency mortgagebacked securities do not have explicit credit ratings however management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the us government or us governmentsponsored enterprises 

mortgage lending portfolio 

the bank loan portfolio includes first mortgages helocs and other loans the credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews management regularly reviews asset quality including concentrations delinquencies nonaccrual loans chargeoffs and recoveries all are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for loan losses 

our residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum ltv ratios cash out limits and minimum fair isaac corporation fico credit scores the specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan for example whether the property is a primary or secondary residence whether the loan is for investment property whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo

schwab does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a fico score of less than 620 at origination unless the borrower has compensating credit factors for more information on credit quality indicators relating to schwab’s bank loans see item 8 – note 7 

securities and instrumentbased lending portfolios 

collateral arrangements relating to margin loans pals option and futures positions securities lending agreements and resale agreements include provisions that require additional collateral in the event of market fluctuations additionally for margin loans pals options and futures positions and securities lending agreements collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral sufficiently exceeds the credit exposure in order to maintain a fully secured position 

other counterparty exposures 

schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations mutual funds and other financial institutions even if schwab’s clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to schwab 

market risk 

market risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or market conditions we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on our interestearning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources that finance these assets 

net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets primarily include investment securities margin loans and bank loans these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans and control the composition of our investment securities we have some ability to manage our net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions 

to mitigate the risk of declining interest revenue we have established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of our interestearning assets and funding sources to remain within these guidelines we manage the maturity repricing and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios 

financial instruments are also subject to the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument we are indirectly exposed to option futures and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers and client securities loaned out as part of the brokerage securities lending activities equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity margin borrowing and overall client engagement with schwab additionally we earn mutual fund and etf service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue we earn 

our market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material 

net interest revenue simulation 

for schwab’s net interest revenue sensitivity analysis we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulation includes all interestsensitive assets and liabilities key variables in the simulation include the repricing of financial instruments prepayment reinvestment and product pricing assumptions the simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and as a result cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue actual results may differ from simulated results due

to balance growth or decline and the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies including changes in asset and liability mix 

if our guidelines for net interest revenue sensitivity are breached management must report the breach to the financial risk oversight committee and establish a plan to address the interest rate risk there were no breaches of schwab’s net interest revenue sensitivity risk limits during the years ended december 31 2018  or 2017  

as represented by the simulations presented below our investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall 

the simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheets would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as we actively manage the consolidated balance sheets and interest rate exposure in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the simulated net interest revenue change over the next 12 months beginning december 31 2018  and 2017  of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period 



the yearoveryear change in net interest revenue sensitivities reflects higher interest rates across the yield curve and particularly higher shortterm interest rates 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the potential that schwab will be unable to meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses 

due to its role as a source of financial strength csc’s liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of csco the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries principal and interest due on corporate debt dividend payments on csc’s preferred stock and returns of capital to common stockholders the liquidity needs of csco are primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin borrowing activities and capital expenditures the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries are primarily driven by client deposits we have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions we seek to maintain client confidence in the balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the company to meet its obligations to this end we have established limits and contingency funding scenarios to support liquidity levels during both business as usual and stressed conditions 

we employ a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity we conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during marketrelated or companyspecific liquidity stress events liquidity is also tested at key subsidiaries and results are reported to the financial risk oversight committee a number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the organization and are reviewed with management as appropriate

the company was subject to and was in compliance with the modified lcr rule at december 31 2018  as schwab’s consolidated balance sheet assets were above 250 billion at december 31 2018 schwab will become subject to the full lcr rule in the second quarter of 2019 the table below presents information about our average lcr 



1   this amount represents modified net cash outflows as defined by the lcr rule which requires that hqla cover 70 of total stressed net cash outflows 

primary funding sources 

schwab’s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts these funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients 

other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations maturities and sales of investment securities repayments on loans securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts repurchase agreements and cash provided by external financing 

to meet daily funding needs we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and shortterm investments for unanticipated liquidity needs a buffer of highly liquid investments currently comprised of us treasury notes is also maintained 

additional funding sources 

in addition to internal sources of liquidity schwab has access to external funding the need for shortterm borrowings from these facilities arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements scheduled liquidation of interestearning investments movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements and general corporate purposes we maintain policies and procedures necessary to access funding and test discount window borrowing procedures on a periodic basis 

the following table describes external debt facilities available at december 31 2018  



1 amounts available are dependent on the amount of first mortgages helocs and the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral 

2  csc has authorization from its board of directors to issue commercial paper notes to not exceed 15 billion  management has set a current limit not to exceed the amount of the committed unsecured credit facility 

3  other than an overnight borrowing to test availability this facility was unused during 2018  

4 amounts available are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral 

certain banking subsidiaries maintain secured credit facilities with the federal home loan bank of san francisco fhlb amounts available under these facilities are dependent on the value of our first mortgages helocs and the fair value of certain of our investment securities that are pledged as collateral during 2018 csb used borrowings under this agreement to purchase investment securities in advance of bank sweep transfers this credit facility is also available as backup financing in the event the outflow of client cash from the banking subsidiaries’ respective balance sheets is greater than maturities and paydowns on investment securities and bank loans

csb also has access to shortterm secured funding through the federal reserve’s discount window amounts available under the federal reserve discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral 

csc has a commercial paper program of which proceeds are used for general corporate purposes the maturities of the commercial paper notes may vary but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue csc’s ratings for these shortterm borrowings are p1 by moody’s a1 by standard  poor’s and f1 by fitch csc had no commercial paper notes outstanding at december 31 2018  or 2017  

the financial covenants for the 750 million  committed credit facility require csco to maintain a minimum net capital ratio csb to be well capitalized and csc to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity adjusted to exclude aoci at december 31 2018  the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was 145 billion  csc’s stockholders’ equity excluding aoci at december 31 2018  was 209 billion  management believes these restrictions will not have a material effect on csc’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements 

to partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the options clearing corporation csco has unsecured standby letter of credit agreements locs with several banks in favor of the options clearing corporation aggregating 225 million  at december 31 2018  there were no  funds drawn under any of these locs during 2018  or 2017  in connection with its securities lending activities the company is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients the collateral requirements were satisfied by providing cash as collateral 

csc has a universal automatic shelf registration statement shelf registration statement on file with the sec which enables it to issue debt equity and other securities

tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted 

internal guidelines are set for both csc and its regulated subsidiaries to ensure capital levels are in line with our strategy and regulatory requirements capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at assetliability management and pricing committee and financial risk oversight committee meetings a number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify potential problems that could impact capital in addition we monitor the subsidiaries’ capital levels and requirements subject to regulatory capital requirements and any required approvals any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to csc in the form of dividends and returns of capital when subsidiaries have need of additional capital funds are provided by csc as equity investments and also as subordinated loans in a form approved as regulatory capital by regulators for csco the details and method used for each cash infusion are based on an analysis of the particular entity’s needs and financing alternatives the amounts and structure of infusions must take into consideration maintenance of regulatory capital requirements debtequity ratios and equity double leverage ratios 

schwab conducts regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various adverse macroeconomic and companyspecific events to which the company could be subjected the objective of the capital stress testing is 1 to explore various potential outcomes – including rare and extreme events and 2 to assess impacts of potential stressful outcomes on both capital and liquidity additionally we have a comprehensive capital contingency plan to provide action plans for certain low probabilityhigh impact capital events that the company might face the capital contingency plan is issued under the authority of the financial risk oversight committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events it does not specifically address every contingency but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress the results of the stress testing indicate there are two scenarios which could stress the company’s capital 1 inflows of balance sheet cash during a period of very low interest rates and 2 outflows of balance sheet cash when other sources of financing are not available and the company is required to sell assets to fund the flows at a loss the capital contingency plan is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate 

for additional information see business – regulation in part i item 1 

regulatory capital requirements 

csc is subject to capital requirements set by the federal reserve and is required to serve as a source of strength for our banking subsidiaries and to provide financial assistance if our banking subsidiaries experience financial distress schwab is required to maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio for csc of at least 4 however management seeks to maintain the ratio of at least 6 due to the relatively low risk of our balance sheet assets and riskbased capital ratios at csc and csb that are well in excess of regulatory requirements the tier 1 leverage ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on csc’s asset growth 

our banking subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements set by their regulators that are substantially similar to those imposed on csc by the federal reserve our banking subsidiaries’ failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that could have a direct material effect on the banks schwab’s principal banking subsidiary csb is required to maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 to be well capitalized but seeks to maintain the ratio of at least 625 based on its regulatory capital ratios at december 31 2018  csb is considered well capitalized

fair value of financial instruments 

schwab uses the market approach to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value and to determine fair value disclosures see item 8 – note 2 and note 16 for more information on our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 

when available schwab uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities when utilizing market data and bidask spread we use the price within the bidask spread that best represents fair value when quoted prices do not exist prices are obtained from independent thirdparty pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets we generally obtain prices from three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value our primary thirdparty pricing service provides prices based on observable trades and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads and weightedaverage maturity for the same or similar “tobeissued” securities we compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent thirdparty pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded at december 31 2018  and 2017  we did not adjust prices received from the primary independent thirdparty pricing service 

critical accounting estimates 

the consolidated financial statements of schwab have been prepared in accordance with gaap item 8 – note 2 contains more information on our significant accounting policies made in connection with its application of these accounting principles 

while the majority of the revenues expenses assets and liabilities are not based on estimates there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on schwab’s financial position and reported financial results these critical accounting estimates are described below management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy 

management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors additionally management has reviewed with the audit committee the company’s significant estimates discussed in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

income taxes 

schwab estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate including federal state and local domestic jurisdictions and immaterial amounts owed to several foreign jurisdictions the estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statements of income in taxes on income accrued taxes are reported in other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes deferred tax assets are recognized if in management’s judgment their realizability is determined to be more likely than not uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize an uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement in estimating accrued taxes we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances 

changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates interpretations of tax laws the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities and newly enacted statutory judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions these changes when they occur affect accrued taxes and can be

legal and regulatory reserves 

reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter after considering among other factors the progress of the case prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases available defenses and the opinions and views of legal counsel in many cases including most class action lawsuits it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred or to estimate the range of that loss until the matter is close to resolution in which case no accrual is made until that time reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved see item 8 – note 14 for more information on the company’s contingencies related to legal and regulatory reserves

business strategy and competitive environment 

schwab was founded on the belief that all americans deserve access to a better investing experience although much has changed in the intervening years our purpose remains clear – to champion every client’s goals with passion and integrity guided by this purpose and the aspiration of creating the most trusted leader in investment services management has adopted a strategy described as “through clients’ eyes” 

under this approach our strategic goals are focused on putting clients’ perspectives needs and desires at the forefront because investing plays a fundamental role in building financial security we strive to deliver a better investing experience for our clients – individual investors and the people and institutions who serve them – by disrupting longstanding industry practices on their behalf and providing superior service we aim to offer a broad range of products and solutions to meet client needs with a focus on transparency and value in addition management works to couple schwab’s scale and resources with ongoing expense discipline to keep costs low and ensure that products and solutions are affordable as well as responsive to client needs finally we seek to maximize our market valuation and stockholder returns over time 

management estimates that investable wealth in the us currently exceeds 30 trillion which means the company’s 336 trillion  in client assets leaves substantial opportunity for growth our strategy is based on the principle that developing trusted relationships will translate into more assets from both new and existing clients ultimately driving more revenue and along with expense discipline generate earnings growth and build longterm stockholder value

within investor services our competition in serving individual investors includes a wide range of brokerage wealth management and asset management firms as well as banks and trust companies in the advisor services arena we compete with institutional custodians traditional and discount brokers banks and investment advisory firms and trust companies 

across both segments our key competitive advantages are 

 

sources of net revenues 

our major sources of net revenues are net interest revenue asset management and administration fees and trading revenue these revenue streams are supported by the combination of bank brokerdealer and asset management operating subsidiaries each of which brings specific capabilities that enable us to provide clients with the products and services they are looking for 

net interest revenue is the difference between interest generated on interestearning assets and interest paid on funding sources the majority of which is derived from client cash balances held by schwab as part of the clients’ overall relationship with the company while certain client cash balances are held on csco’s balance sheet or swept to our money market funds a substantial amount of existing cash balances and most new client cash inflows are swept to a banking subsidiary over time as supporting capital has been available we have been directing a growing proportion of client cash sweep balances to a banking subsidiary relative to those going to the brokerdealer or money market funds this shift has been effected through changes to default sweep options and the periodic bulk transfer of larger balances bank sweep balances have access to federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance protection as allowed and provide us with greater flexibility in terms of options for investing the cash and administering the interest rate paid 

the majority of asset management and administration fees are earned from proprietary money market mutual funds proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds and exchangetraded funds etfs and feebased advisory solutions 

trading revenue includes commissions earned for executing trades for clients in individual equities options futures fixed income securities and certain thirdparty mutual funds and etfs as well as principal transaction revenue earned primarily from actions to support client trading in fixed income securities

this regulatory framework is designed to protect depositors and consumers the safety and soundness of depository institutions and their holding companies and the stability of the banking system as a whole this framework affects the activities and investments of csc and its subsidiaries and gives the regulatory authorities broad discretion in connection with their supervisory examination and enforcement activities and policies 

financial regulatory reform 

following the enactment of doddfrank the federal banking agencies have adopted a number of implementing regulations and other regulatory reforms that are significant for csc and its banking subsidiaries these regulations are highlighted below 

basel iii capital and liquidity framework 

banking organizations are subject to the regulatory capital rules issued by the federal reserve and other us banking regulators including the occ and the fdic in addition to minimum riskbased capital requirements banking organizations must hold additional capital referred to as a capital conservation buffer to avoid being subject to limits on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers 

the regulatory capital rules provide for a “standardized approach” framework for the calculation of a banking organization’s regulatory capital and riskweighted assets depository institutions and their holding companies with consolidated total assets of 250 billion or more or total onbalancesheet foreign exposure of 10 billion or more are also required to calculate their regulatory capital and riskweighted assets using an “advanced approaches” framework and must satisfy the minimum capital requirements under both approaches such companies must also maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of at least 30 must include accumulated other comprehensive income aoci in their calculation of their capital ratios and are subject to certain other enhanced provisions including additional reporting requirements csc and its banking subsidiaries are currently only subject to the “standardized approach” framework but will become subject to the “advanced approaches” framework upon exceeding either of the thresholds 

the liquidity coverage ratio lcr rule requires banking organizations with consolidated total assets of 250 billion or more or total onbalancesheet foreign exposure of 10 billion or more and their depository institution subsidiaries with 10 billion or more in total consolidated assets to hold high quality liquid assets hqla in an amount equal to at least 100 of their projected net cash outflows over the 30day period calculated on each business day other bank and savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more are subject to a modified lcr rule requiring them to hold hqla in an amount equal to at least 70 of their projected net cash outflows over the 30day period calculated as of the last business day of the month

as a savings and loan holding company csc is not subject to the annual comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar process which requires certain financial institutions to submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve csc continues to enhance its stress testing policies procedures systems and governance structures to be consistent with regulatory expectations for a firm of its size and complexity

the charles schwab corporation 

insured depository institution resolution plans 

the fdic requires insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more to submit to the fdic periodic plans providing for their resolution by the fdic in the event of failure resolution plans or socalled “living wills” under the receivership and liquidation provisions of the federal deposit insurance act schwab bank is required to file with the fdic an annual resolution plan demonstrating how the bank could be resolved in an orderly and timely manner in the event of receivership such that the fdic would be able to ensure that the bank’s depositors receive access to their deposits within one business day maximize the net present value of the bank’s assets when disposed of and minimize losses incurred by the bank’s creditors 

consumer financial protection 

the cfpb has broad rulemaking supervisory and enforcement authority for a wide range of federal consumer protection laws relating to financial products the cfpb has examination and primary enforcement authority over depository institutions with 10 billion or more in consolidated total assets 

deposit insurance assessments 

the fdic’s deposit insurance fund dif provides insurance coverage for certain deposits generally up to 250000 per depositor per account ownership type and is funded by quarterly assessments on insured depository institutions the fdic uses a riskbased deposit premium assessment system that for large insured depository institutions with at least 10 billion in total consolidated assets uses a scorecard method based on a number of factors including the institution’s regulatory ratings asset quality and brokered deposits the deposit insurance assessment base is calculated as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity 

the doddfrank act i raised the minimum reserve ratio for the dif to 135 from the former minimum of 115 and ii required that the dif’s reserve ratio reach 135 by september 30 2020 

in july 2016 the fdic imposed a flatrate quarterly surcharge on insured depository institutions with total assets of 10 billion or more and certain of their bank affiliates to pay for the increase the surcharge took effect at the same time as a scheduled reduction in the regular fdic insurance as a result schwab’s banking subsidiaries are now subject to a 3 basis point regular assessment on their respective assessment bases down from 5 basis points and a new 45 basis point surcharge on the amount of their aggregate assessment base in excess of 10 billion that will remain in effect until the earlier of the dif reaching 135 or december 31 2018 if dif has not reached 135 by such date the fdic will impose a shortfall assessment 

community reinvestment act 

the community reinvestment act of 1977 cra requires the primary federal bank regulatory agency for each of schwab’s depository institution subsidiaries to assess the subsidiary’s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank including low and moderateincome neighborhoods and persons institutions are assigned one of four ratings “outstanding” “satisfactory” “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance” the failure of an institution to receive at least a “satisfactory” rating could inhibit the institution or its holding company from undertaking certain activities including acquisitions or opening branch offices 

source of strength 

the doddfrank act codified the federal reserve’s longheld position that a depository institution holding company must serve as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary depository institutions the socalled “source of strength doctrine” in effect the holding company may be compelled to commit resources to support the subsidiary in the event the subsidiary is in financial distress

risk factors 

tableend 

we face a variety of risks that may affect our operations financial results or stock price and many of those risks are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict the following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant although there may be other risks that could arise or may prove to be more significant than expected that may affect our operations or financial results 

for a discussion of our risk management including operational risk compliance risk credit risk market risk and liquidity risk see risk management and capital management in part ii item 7 

developments in the business economic and geopolitical environment could negatively impact our business 

our business can be adversely affected by the general environment – economic corporate securities market regulatory and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations trading activity interest rates and overall investor engagement and are outside of our control deterioration in the housing and credit markets reduction in shortterm interest rates and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact our results of operations and capital resources 

extensive regulation of our businesses may subject us to significant penalties   or limitations on business activities 

as a participant in the securities banking and financial services industries we are subject to extensive regulation under federal state and foreign laws by governmental agencies supervisory authorities and sros the costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase these regulations affect our business operations and impose capital client protection and market conduct requirements on us 

in addition to specific banking laws and regulations our banking regulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies and could require csc andor our banking subsidiaries to hold more capital increase liquidity or limit their ability to pay dividends or csc’s ability to repurchase or redeem shares the banking regulators could also limit our ability to grow including adding assets launching new products making acquisitions and undertaking strategic investments could limit our banking subsidiaries’ ability to accept deposits swept from client brokerage accounts and brokered deposits and could prevent us from pursuing our business strategy 

despite our efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements there are a number of risks particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by our regulators against us or our affiliates officers or employees could result in fines penalties cease and desist orders enforcement actions suspension disqualification or expulsion or other disciplinary sanctions including limitations on our business activities any of which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

while we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations violations could occur in addition some legalregulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time there may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance including restrictions on certain activities such a finding may also damage our reputation and our relationships with our regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities

legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect our business and financial results 

new legislation rules regulations and guidance or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal state foreign and sro rules regulations and guidance including changes relating to mutual funds brokerdealer fiduciary duties and regulatory treatment of deposit accounts may directly affect the operation and profitability of schwab or its specific business lines our profitability could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally including changes to the laws governing taxation electronic commerce client privacy and security of client data in addition the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct modifications to our business practices more stringent capital and liquidity requirements increased deposit insurance assessments or additional costs these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance risk management treasury and operations functions 

failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect our financial condition 

csc together with its banking and brokerdealer subsidiaries must meet certain capital and liquidity standards subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of schwab’s capital and schwab’s internal assessment of its capital needs the uniform net capital rule limits csco’s ability to transfer capital to csc and other affiliates new regulatory capital liquidity and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital including paying dividends stock repurchases and redemptions and may require us to increase our capital andor liquidity or to limit our growth failure by either csc or its banking subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have a negative impact on us in addition failure by csc or our banking subsidiaries to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy their capital conservation buffer requirements as phased in would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as tier 1 capital or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could require us to liquidate assets deleverage or otherwise change our business andor investment plans which may adversely affect our financial results issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders 

with 2433 billion  in consolidated total assets at december 31 2017  we are currently only subject to the “standardized approach” capital framework of basel iii and modified liquidity requirements when our consolidated total assets equal or exceed 250 billion we will become subject to the “advanced approaches” framework including being subject to a supplementary leverage ratio the inclusion of aoci in regulatory capital the unmodified lcr enhanced basel iii disclosures and a more complex calculation of risk weighted assets that includes an assessment of the impact of operational risk in addition federal banking agencies have broad discretion and could require csc or its banking subsidiaries to hold higher levels of capital or increase liquidity above the applicable regulatory requirements 

significant interest rate changes could affect our profitability 

the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings a decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on our net interest revenue a low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact on our asset management and administration fee revenues if we have to waive a portion of our management fees for certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds in order to continue providing a positive return to clients 

overall we are positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment a rise in interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase if market conditions or the competitive environment forces us to raise our interest rates to avoid losing deposits higher funding costs without offsetting increases in yields on interestearning assets can reduce our net interest revenue 

the manner in which interest rates are calculated could also impact our net interest revenue for example certain securities in schwab’s investment portfolios have floating interest rates based on benchmarks like the onemonth libor which has been the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms may cause libor to perform differently than in the past or be replaced as a benchmark and could result in lower interest payments and a reduction in the value of the securities 

 10   

the charles schwab corporation 

a significant change in client cash allocations could negatively impact our net interest revenue 

we rely heavily on bank deposits as a low cost source of funding to extend loans to clients and purchase investment securities our bank deposits are primarily driven by our bank sweep feature uninvested cash balances in our client brokerage accounts are swept to our banking subsidiaries a significant reduction in our clients’ allocation to cash a change in the allocation of that cash or a transfer of cash away from the company could reduce net interest revenue 

security breaches of our systems or those of our clients or third parties may subject us to significant liability and damage schwab’s reputation 

our business involves the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential information about our clients and us information security risks for financial institutions are increasing in part because of the use of the internet and mobile technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime activists hackers and other external parties including foreign state actors our systems and those of other financial institutions have been and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks malicious code computer viruses   and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access misuse loss or destruction of data including confidential client information account takeovers unavailability of service or other events despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means for example employee misconduct 

given the high volume of transactions that we process the large number of clients counterparties and thirdparty service providers with which we do business and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected the extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before an investigation is completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known during such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack 

security breaches including breaches of our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers or clients could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject us to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance actions by our regulators damage to schwab’s reputation or a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures 

we also face risk related to external fraud involving the misappropriation and use of clients’ user names passwords or other personal information to gain access to clients’ financial accounts at schwab this could occur from the compromise of clients’ personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company where clients’ personal information is taken and then made available to fraudsters such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties including foreign statesponsored parties losses reimbursed to clients under our guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

technology and operational failures or errors could subject us to losses litigation regulatory actions and reputational damage 

we must process record and monitor a large number of transactions and our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to our systems system interruptions errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes including changes in client use patterns technological failure changes to our systems linkages with thirdparty systems and power failures and can have a significant impact on our business and operations our systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error execution errors errors in models such as those used for asset management capital planning and management risk management stress testing and compliance employee misconduct unauthorized trading external fraud computer viruses distributed denial of service attacks cyber attacks terrorist attacks natural disaster power outage capacity constraints software flaws events impacting key business partners and vendors and similar events for example schwab and other financial institutions have been the 

 11   

the charles schwab corporation 

target of various denial of service attacks that have in certain circumstances made websites mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time it could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to our technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence which could affect our ability to process and settle client transactions moreover instances of fraud or other misconduct might also negatively impact schwab’s reputation and client confidence in the company in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances despite our efforts to identify areas of risk oversee operational areas involving risk and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks there can be no assurance that we will not suffer unexpected losses reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors including those of our vendors or other third parties 

while we devote substantial attention and resources to the reliability capacity and scalability of our systems extraordinary trading volumes could cause our computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail affecting our ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients’ orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses and decreased client satisfaction we are also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges clearing houses and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement system failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices cause substantial losses for us and for our clients and subject us to claims from our clients for damages 

  

a significant decrease in our liquidity could negatively affect our business and financial management as well as reduce client confidence in schwab 

maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our business operations including margin lending mortgage lending and transaction settlement among other liquidity needs we meet our liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by client activity and operating earnings as well as cash provided by external financing fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances as well as changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits or market conditions may affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs a reduction in our liquidity position could reduce client confidence in schwab which could result in the loss of client accounts or could cause us to fail to satisfy our liquidity requirements including the modified lcr in addition if our brokerdealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to csc which could reduce csc’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt and pay cash dividends in addition csc may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries 

factors which may adversely affect our liquidity position include csco having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances unanticipated outflows of company cash fluctuations in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts a dramatic increase in our client lending activities including margin mortgagerelated and personal lending increased capital requirements changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations other regulatory changes or a loss of market or client confidence in schwab 

when cash generated by client activity and operating earnings is not sufficient for our liquidity needs we may seek external financing during periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets potential sources of external financing could be reduced and borrowing costs could increase although csc and csco maintain committed and uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines and csc has a commercial paper issuance program as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec which can be used to sell securities financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets in addition a significant downgrade in the company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets 

we may suffer significant losses from our credit exposures 

our businesses are subject to the risk that a client counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate while we have policies and procedures designed to manage this risk the policies and procedures may not be fully effective our exposure mainly results from margin lending clients’ options trading futures activities securities lending mortgage lending pledged asset lending our role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds we sponsor 

when clients purchase securities on margin borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities or trade options or futures we are subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their 

 12   

the charles schwab corporation 

accounts falls below the amount of clients’ indebtedness abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses 

we have exposure to credit risk associated with our investments those investments are subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial market’s assessment of credit quality loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such securities are other than temporarily impaired the evaluation of whether otherthantemporary impairment otti exists is a matter of judgment which includes the assessment of several factors if management determines that a security is otti the cost basis of the security may be adjusted and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings deterioration in the performance of available for sale afs and held to maturity htm securities could result in the recognition of future impairment charges even if a security is not considered otti if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs we would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time 

  

our bank loans primarily consist of first mortgages helocs and pals increases in delinquency and default rates housing and stock price declines increases in the unemployment rate and other economic factors can result in charges for loan loss reserves and write downs on such loans 

heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments can increase our risk of loss examples include 

 

we sponsor a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds although we have no obligation to do so we may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit liquidity or other support to our funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity such support could cause us to take significant charges could reduce our liquidity and in certain situations could with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds result in us having to consolidate a supported fund in our financial statements if we chose not to provide credit liquidity or other support in such a situation schwab could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected 

we are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending against claims or proceedings 

the financial services industry faces significant litigation and regulatory risks we are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business including arbitrations class actions and other litigation some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages we are also the subject of inquiries investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies 

litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by our clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied at schwab claims from clients of third party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors’ misconduct litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights eg patents such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources if we were found to have infringed on a thirdparty patent or other intellectual property rights we could incur substantial damages and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology or providing certain products or services 

actions brought against us may result in settlements awards injunctions fines penalties or other results adverse to us including reputational harm even if we are successful in defending against these actions the defense of such matters may result in us incurring significant expenses a substantial judgment settlement fine or penalty could be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular future period depending on our results for that period in market downturns the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased 

 13   

the charles schwab corporation 

we rely on outsourced service providers to perform key functions 

we rely on external service providers to perform certain key technology processing servicing and support functions these service providers face technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information could cause us to incur losses and could harm schwab’s reputation an interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints financial difficulties or for any other reason and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in financial losses to us switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations 

  

potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on our financial position 

we evaluate potential strategic transactions including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions any such transaction could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows the process of evaluating negotiating and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert management’s attention from other business concerns and might cause the loss of key clients employees and business partners moreover integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties including the need to integrate operational financial and management information systems and management controls integrate relationships with clients and business partners and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas in addition an acquisition may cause us to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings further we may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition and any future acquisition could be dilutive to our current stockholders’ percentage ownership or to earnings per common share eps 

our acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business operations or financial condition of the entity being acquired or sold to the extent we enter into an agreement to buy or sell an entity there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected or at all if a material transaction does not close our stock price could decline 

our industry is characterized by aggressive price competition 

we continually monitor our pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjust trade commission rates interest rates on deposits and loans fees for advisory services expense ratios on mutual funds and etfs and other pricing to enhance our competitive position increased price competition from other financial services firms such as reduced commissions to attract trading volume higher deposit rates to attract client cash balances or reduced expense ratios to attract mutual fund or etf investments could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

we face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees 

the market for qualified personnel in our business is highly competitive at various times different functions and roles are in especially high demand in the market compelling us to pay more to attract talent our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs 

our stock price has fluctuated historically and may continue to fluctuate 

our stock price can be volatile among the factors that may affect the volatility of our stock price are the following

changes in the stock market generally or as it concerns our industry as well as geopolitical corporate regulatory business and economic factors may also affect our stock price 

future sales of csc’s equity securities may adversely affect the market price of csc’s common stock and result in dilution 

csc’s certificate of incorporation authorizes csc’s board of directors among other things to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities without stockholder approval 

csc may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes the issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of csc’s common stock and may adversely affect the market price of csc’s common stock

overview 

management focuses on several client activity and financial metrics in evaluating schwab’s financial position and operating performance we believe that metrics relating to net new and total client assets as well as client cash levels and utilization of advisory services offer perspective on our business momentum and client engagement data on new and total client brokerage accounts provides additional perspective on our ability to attract and retain new business total net revenue growth pretax profit margin eps and return on average common stockholders’ equity provide broad indicators of schwab’s overall financial health operating efficiency and ability to generate acceptable returns total expenses excluding interest as a percentage of average client assets is a measure of operating efficiency finally management believes the consolidated tier 1 leverage ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint currently imposed by regulators results for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  are 



1   2017 excludes an inflow of 345 billion relating to mutual fund clearing services clients 2015 excludes an inflow of 61 billion to reflect the final impact of the consolidation of its retirement plan recordkeeping platforms an inflow of 102 billion relating to a mutual fund clearing services client and an outflow of 116 billion relating to the company’s planned resignation from an advisor services cash management relationship netting to an adjustment of 47 billion 

2017  compared to 2016   

net income available to common stockholders rose in 2017 by 434 million  or 25  from the prior year resulting in diluted eps of 161  in 2017  – an increase of 23 compared to 131  in 2016  net revenues improved by 11 billion or 15  while expenses excluding interest increased 483 million  or 11  compared to 2016  

our steady focus on operating ‘through clients’ eyes’ and our goal to continually challenge the status quo helped schwab achieve another strong growth year in 2017 clients opened 14 million new brokerage accounts in 2017 and trusted schwab with 1986 billion of core net new assets in 2017 up 58 from 2016 total assets receiving ongoing advisory services grew 21 in 2017 to 170 trillion  our success with clients was bolstered by strength in the equity markets – the standard  poor’s 500 ®  index sp 500 finished 2017 up 19 from the prior year end also in 2017 the federal reserve increased

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted 

the overnight federal funds target interest rate three times for a total of 75 basis points strong client activity and the positive economic environment resulted in total client assets rising to 336 trillion as of december 31 2017 – a 21 increase since the end of 2016 

schwab’s 2017 financial results demonstrate the power of our financial formula working as designed our robust business growth supported strong revenue growth through multiple sources in 2017 which we combined with continued expense discipline to drive significantly improved profitability 

net revenues grew by 15 in 2017 compared to 2016 through contributions from our two largest revenue sources net interest revenue rose 29 while asset management and administration fees grew 11 in 2017 when compared to the prior year trading revenue declined in 2017 by 21 due to price reductions announced early in 2017 

consistent with our expectations expenses grew 11 in 2017 compared to the prior year this increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation and higher staffing related to our strong asset gathering as well as expenses related to project spending and thirdparty fees tied to higher balances in our asset management business 

this combination of revenue growth and expense discipline drove the pretax profit margin to 424 – an increase of 240 basis points over the prior year earnings before income taxes rose 22 to 37 billion in 2017 compared to 30 billion in the prior year 

the effective tax rate in 2017 was 355 compared to 369 in 2016 reflecting the benefit from the adoption of new accounting standards requiring the recognition of a portion of tax deductions related to equity compensation partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and other tax adjustments associated with the enactment in 2017 of a new tax act see current regulatory environment and other developments for more information 

2016  compared to 2015   

in 2016 net income available to common stockholders increased 382 million or 28 from the prior year resulting in diluted eps of 131 in 2016 compared to 103 in 2015 net revenues improved by 11 billion or 17 while expenses excluding interest increased 384 million or 9 compared to 2015 

strong client momentum continued as our innovative fullservice model resonated with clients and drove growth during the year we added 11 million new brokerage accounts to our client base during 2016 which contributed to bringing the total active brokerage accounts to 102 million by yearend core net new assets from new and existing clients totaled 1255 billion in 2016 which helped grow total client assets to 278 trillion as of december 31 2016 also during 2016 investors increasingly turned to schwab’s advice offerings resulting in a 12 increase in client assets enrolled in one of our retail advisory solutions and those guided by independent advisors to 140 trillion at the end of the year 

client assets grew by 11 during an environment that had periods of marked volatility but ultimately included improving economic conditions the sp 500 ended 2016 10 higher than the prior year end after years of ultralow interest rates the federal reserve’s move to increase the overnight federal funds target rate by 25 basis points in december 2015 helped throughout 2016 the federal reserve’s subsequent additional 25 basis point increase in december 2016 had little time to impact 2016 results other shortterm rates also rose in 2016 the onemonth london interbank offered rate libor improved 34 basis points to 77 at december 31 2016 compared to december 31 2015 

these external drivers and the solid client growth helped produce strong net revenue growth schwab’s 17 net revenue growth was led by increased net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees which more than offset lower revenue from trading and other revenue net interest revenue improved 797 million or 32 in 2016 compared to 2015 and asset management and administration fees improved 405 million or 15 

strong net revenue growth provided room for increased investment in people and technology resulting in a 9 expense growth for 2016 this increase allowed for a 780 basis point gap between net revenue and expense growth and a pretax profit margin of 400 in 2016 compared to 357 in 2015

as a result of the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap require companies to remeasure their deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of the date of enactment with the resulting tax effects accounted for in the reporting period of enactment schwab has recorded a onetime noncash charge to taxes on income associated with the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and other tax adjustments related to the tax reform legislation in the fourth quarter of 2017 our 2018 effective income tax rate will be reduced as a result of these changes

in october 2015 the federal reserve issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on total lossabsorbing capacity and longterm debt that among other things would have required certain financial institutions that are subject to the federal reserve’s capital rules to deduct from their regulatory capital the amount of any investments in or exposure to unsecured debt issued by us bank holding companies identified as global systemically important banking organizations gsibs in december 2016 the federal reserve issued a final rule that did not include this regulatory capital deduction proposal at the same time the federal reserve did indicate its intent to work with the occ and fdic to develop a proposed interagency approach towards the regulatory capital treatment of gsib unsecured debt the company will evaluate any such proposal when it is issued

results of operations 

total net revenues 

total net revenues of 86 billion  and 75 billion  for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively grew 15  and 17  from the prior periods reflecting significant improvements in both net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees 



net interest revenue 

schwab’s primary interestearning assets include cash and cash equivalents cash and investments segregated margin loans which constitute the majority of receivables from brokerage clients investment securities and bank loans revenue on interestearning assets is affected by various factors such as the composition of assets prevailing interest rates at the time of origination or purchase changes in interest rates on floating rate securities and changes in prepayment levels for mortgagerelated securities and loans fees earned on securities borrowing and lending activities which are conducted by csco on assets held in client brokerage accounts are included in other interest revenue and expense 

schwab’s interestbearing liabilities include bank deposits payables to brokerage clients shortterm borrowings and longterm debt we establish the rates paid on clientrelated liabilities and management expects that it will generally adjust the rates paid on these liabilities at some fraction of any movement in shortterm rates clientrelated liabilities have historically been very stable and are largely expected to remain so given the stability and low rate sensitivity of these liabilities management believes their duration is relatively long somewhere in excess of three and a half years 

management believes that the extended period of extraordinarily low interest rates running from the financial crisis to the present has likely resulted in certain sweep cash balances retaining some level of latent rate sensitivity to the extent shortterm rates increase management expects some sweep cash balances to migrate to purchased money market funds or other higheryielding alternatives at the same time schwab will retain the opportunity to migrate the remaining nonrate sensitive cash in sweep money market funds to bank sweep deposits 

we have positioned schwab to benefit from an increase in interest rates especially shortterm interest rates by managing the duration of interestearning assets to be shorter than that of interestbearing liabilities so that asset yields will move faster than liability costs 

in order to keep interestrate sensitivity within established limits management monitors and responds to changes in the balance sheet as schwab builds its client base we attract new client sweep cash which along with the bulk transfer of

tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted 

existing sweep cash balances from money market funds is a primary driver of balance sheet growth as the proportion of sweep cash balances to total liabilities has grown the measured duration of liabilities has grown as well by increasing the duration of interestearning assets as necessary we are positioned to continue to gain from increasing rates while limiting exposure to falling rates to an acceptable level approximately half of our investment securities and loans reprice or reset based on shortterm interest rates such as onemonth libor 

noninterestbearing funding sources include certain cash balances stockholders’ equity and other miscellaneous assets and liabilities 

the following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interestearning assets and funding sources on the consolidated balance sheets 



1   interest revenue or expense was less than 500000 in the period or periods presented 

2   amounts calculated based on amortized cost 

net interest revenue increased 960 million  or 29  in 2017  from 2016  and 797 million  or 32  in 2016  from 2015  primarily due to higher interest rates and growth in interestearning assets driven by bank deposits 

higher shortterm interest rates reflecting the federal reserve’s december june and march 2017 and december 2016 interest rate hikes coupled with growth in interestearning assets have resulted in a 24  basis point improvement in net interest margin to 197  in 2017  net interest margin was 173  in 2016 representing an improvement of 13 basis points compared to 2015

in 2017 and 2016 average interest earning assets have grown by 14 and 21 respectively from the prior years this growth has been driven primarily by higher bank deposits which increased through a combination of 

 

in 2017 clients allocated more of their cash to equity fixed income and other investments which affected growth in bank sweep deposits 

in march 2017 247 billion  of debt securities were transferred from the afs category to the htm category the transfer had no effect on the overall net interest margin for additional information on the transfer see item 8 – note 5 

asset management and administration fees 

asset management and administration fees include mutual fund and etf service fees and fees for other assetbased financial services provided to individual and institutional clients schwab earns mutual fund and etf service fees for shareholder services administration and investment management provided to its proprietary funds and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to thirdparty funds asset management and administration fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds and do not include securities lending revenues earned by proprietary mutual funds and etfs as those amounts net of program fees are credited to the fund shareholders the fair values of client assets included in proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds and etfs are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data 

we also earn asset management fees for advice solutions which include managed portfolios specialized strategies and customized investment advice other asset management and administration fees include various assetbased fees such as trust fees 401k recordkeeping fees mutual fund clearing fees collective trust fund fees and nonbalance based service and transaction fees 

asset management and administration fees vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity

4   includes miscellaneous service and transaction fees relating to mutual funds and etfs that are not balancebased 

asset management and administration fees increased by 337 million  or 11  in 2017  from 2016  primarily due to higher average client assets invested in advice solutions mutual funds and etfs and lower fee waivers on money market funds partially offsetting these increases were lower fee rates on proprietary money funds and other indexed mutual funds and etfs due to fee reductions implemented by schwab in 2017 

 asset management and administration fees increased by  405 million  or 15  in 2016  from 2015  due to higher net yields on money market fund assets as shortterm interest rates rose in 2016  and growth in client assets enrolled in advisory offers partially offset by a reduction in client assets in mutual fund onesource 

trading revenue 

trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues commission revenue is affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from trading activity in fixed income securities with clients to accommodate clients’ fixed income trading activity schwab maintains positions in fixed income securities including us state and municipal debt obligations us government and corporate debt and other securities the difference between the price at which the company buys and sells securities to and from its clients and other brokerdealers is recognized as principal transaction revenue principal transaction revenue also includes adjustments to the fair value of these securities positions

the following table presents trading revenue and the related drivers 



trading revenue decreased by  171 million  and 41 million  in 2017  and 2016  respectively when compared to the prior years primarily due to lower commissions rates on darts 

during the first quarter of 2017 we announced two trading price reductions which lowered standard equity etf and option trade commissions from 895 to 495 and lowered the per contract option fee from 75 to 65 these reductions in commission rates reflect our continuing belief that pricing should never be an obstacle for choosing schwab and our commitment to share the benefits of scale with clients 

with these changes trading revenue has declined from a peak of 5060 of total revenue in the early 1990’s to the current low of 8 in 2017 11 in 2016 and 14 in 2015 

other revenue 

other revenue includes order flow revenue other service fees software fees from our portfolio management solutions exchange processing fees and nonrecurring gains 

order flow revenue was 114 million  during 2017  and 103 million  for both 2016  and 2015  in 2016 and 2015 other revenue also included net litigation proceeds of 16 and 75 million respectively relating to our nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities portfolios

total expenses excluding interest 

the following table shows a comparison of total expenses excluding interest 



໿ 

expenses excluding interest increased in 2017 and 2016 from the prior years by 11 and 9 respectively the largest drivers of the increase in both years were compensation and benefits and professional services 

salaries and wages increased in 2017  and 2016  from the prior years primarily due to increases in employee headcount to support the growth in the business and annual salary increases 

incentive compensation increased in 2017  and 2016  from the prior years primarily due to increased net client asset flows and increased employee headcount 

employee benefits and other expenses increased in 2017  and 2016  from the prior years as a result of the increases in employee headcount salaries wages and incentive compensation 

professional services expense increased in 2017  and 2016  from the prior years primarily due to higher spending on technology projects and an increase in asset management and administration related expenses resulting from growth in the schwab funds ®  and schwab etfs™ 

occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2017 and 2016 from the prior years primarily due to increased software maintenance expense relating to information technology systems and increases in facility operational expenses attributable to growth in schwab’s geographic footprint 

depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in 2017 and 2016 from the prior years due to higher amortization of internally developed software associated with our investment in software and technology enhancements

regulatory fees assessments increased in 2017  and 2016  from the prior years primarily due to an increase in fdic insurance assessments which rose as a result of higher bank deposits and the effect of a new surcharge that commenced in the third quarter of 2016 

other expenses have increased in 2017 from the prior year due to travel and entertainment asset volumerelated increases and some miscellaneous items 

capital expenditures were 412 million 353 million and 285 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the increase in capital expenditures in both 2017 and 2016 from the prior years was due to our growing geographical expansion in the us and investments in technology projects the largest component of capital expenditures was capitalized costs for developing internaluse software of 157 million 130 million and 107 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

taxes on income 

effective january 1 2017  schwab adopted accounting standards update asu 201609 which prospectively changes the accounting treatment of a portion of the tax deductions relating to equity compensation these deductions were previously reflected directly in additional paidin capital a component of stockholders’ equity and are now included in taxes on income a component of net income as a result of this change our tax expense was reduced by approximately 87 million  in 2017  future effects will depend on our share price restricted stock vesting and the volume of equity incentive options exercised 

as previously discussed under current regulatory environment and other developments the tax act was signed into law during 2017 among other things the tax act lowers the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective for tax years including or commencing january 1 2018 

in connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the tax act schwab recognized a 46 million  onetime noncash charge to taxes on income in the fourth quarter of 2017  associated with the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and other tax adjustments related to the tax act 

schwab’s effective income tax rate on income before taxes was 355  in 2017  compared to 369  in 2016  the decrease in rates between the two years reflects the net impact of the above two items the effective rate in 2015  was 365  

we estimate our effective income tax rate to be between 23 and 24 in 2018 as a result of the tax act 

segment information 

schwab provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments – investor services and advisor services the investor services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services retirement plan services and other corporate brokerage services to individual investors the advisor services segment provides custodial trading banking and support services as well as retirement business services to independent rias independent retirement advisors and recordkeepers revenues and expenses are attributed to the two segments based on which segment services the client management evaluates the performance of the segments on a pretax basis segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments net revenues in both segments are generated from the underlying client assets and trading activity differences in the composition of net revenues between the segments are based on the composition of client assets client trading frequency and pricing unique to each while both segments leverage the scale and efficiency of our platforms segment expenses reflect the dynamics of serving millions of clients in investor services versus the thousands of rias on the advisor platform

net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets primarily include investment securities margin loans and bank loans these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans and control the composition of our investment securities we have some ability to manage our net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions 

to mitigate the risk of declining interest revenue we have established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of our interestearning assets and funding sources to remain within these guidelines we manage the maturity repricing and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios 

financial instruments are also subject to the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument we are indirectly exposed to option futures and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers and client securities loaned out as part of the brokerage securities lending activities equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity margin borrowing and overall client engagement with schwab additionally we earn mutual fund and etf service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue we earn 

our market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material

net interest revenue simulation 

for schwab’s net interest revenue sensitivity analysis we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulation includes all interestsensitive assets and liabilities key variables in the simulation include the repricing of financial instruments prepayment reinvestment and product pricing assumptions the simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and as a result cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies including changes in asset and liability mix 

if our guidelines for net interest revenue sensitivity are breached management must report the breach to the financial risk oversight committee and establish a plan to address the interest rate risk there were no breaches of our net interest revenue sensitivity risk limits during the years ended december 31 2017  or 2016  

as represented by the simulations presented below our investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall 

the simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheets would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as we actively manage the consolidated balance sheets and interest rate exposure in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the simulated net interest revenue change over the next 12 months beginning december 31 2017  and 2016  of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period 



the change in net interest revenue sensitivities as of december 31 2017  reflects the increase in shortterm interest rates an increase in shortterm interest rates positively impacts net interest revenue as yields on interestearning assets rise faster than the cost of funding sources a decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources compressing net interest margin 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the potential that schwab will be unable to meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses 

due to its role as a source of financial strength csc’s liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of csco the capital needs of the bank subsidiaries the amount of dividend payments on csc’s common and preferred stock and principal and interest due on corporate debt the liquidity needs of csco are primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin borrowing activities and capital expenditures and the capital needs of the bank subsidiaries are primarily driven by client deposits we have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions we seek to maintain client confidence in the balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the company to meet its obligations to this end we have established limits and contingency funding scenarios to support liquidity levels during both business as usual and stressed conditions 

we employ a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity we conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during marketrelated or companyspecific liquidity stress events liquidity is also tested at key subsidiaries and results are reported to the financial risk oversight committee a number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the organization and are reviewed with management as appropriate 

the company is subject to and was in compliance with the modified lcr rule at december 31 2017

primary funding sources 

schwab’s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts these funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients 

other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations maturities and sales of investment securities repayments on loans securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts and cash provided by external financing or equity offerings 

to meet daily funding needs we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and shortterm investments for unanticipated liquidity needs a buffer of highly liquid investments currently comprised of us treasury notes is also maintained 

additional funding sources 

in addition to internal sources of liquidity schwab has access to external funding the need for shortterm borrowings from these facilities arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements scheduled liquidation of interestearning investments movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements and general corporate purposes we maintain policies and procedures necessary to access funding and test discount window borrowing procedures on a periodic basis 

the following table describes external debt facilities are available at december 31 2017 



1  other than an overnight borrowing to test availability this facility was unused during 2017  

2   amounts available are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral 

3   amounts available are dependent on the amount of first mortgages helocs and the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral 

4  csc has authorization from its board of directors to issue commercial paper notes to not exceed 15 billion  management has set a current limit not to exceed the amount of the committed unsecured credit facility 

the financial covenants for the 750 million  committed credit facility require csco to maintain a minimum net capital ratio schwab bank to be well capitalized and csc to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity adjusted to exclude aoci at december 31 2017  the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was 125 billion  csc’s stockholders’ equity excluding aoci at december 31 2017  was 187 billion  management believes these restrictions will not have a material effect on csc’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements 

schwab bank has access to shortterm secured funding through the federal reserve’s discount window amounts available under the federal reserve discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain of schwab bank’s investment securities that are pledged as collateral 

schwab bank also maintains a secured credit facility with the federal home loan bank of san francisco fhlb amounts available under this facility are dependent on the amount of schwab bank’s first mortgages helocs and the fair value of certain of schwab bank’s investment securities that are pledged as collateral during 2017 schwab bank used borrowings under this agreement to purchase investment securities prior to bulk transfers this credit facility is also available as backup financing in the event of the outflow of client cash from schwab bank’s balance sheet 

csc has a commercial paper program of which proceeds are used for general corporate purposes the maturities of the commercial paper notes may vary but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue csc’s ratings for these shortterm borrowings are p1 by moody’s a1 by standard  poor’s and f1 by fitch csc had no commercial paper notes outstanding at december 31 2017  or 2016

capital management 

schwab seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of our business strategy including anticipated balance sheet growth providing financial support to the subsidiaries and sustained access to the capital markets while at the same time meeting our regulatory capital requirements and serving as a source of financial strength to schwab bank schwab’s primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of subsidiaries and securities issuances by csc in the capital markets to ensure that schwab has sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values we have adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios 

internal guidelines are set for both csc and its regulated subsidiaries to ensure capital levels are in line with our strategy and regulatory requirements capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at assetliability management and pricing committee and financial risk oversight committee meetings a number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify potential problems that could impact capital in addition we monitor the subsidiaries’ capital levels and requirements subject to regulatory capital requirements and any required approvals any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to csc in the form of dividends and returns of capital when subsidiaries have need of additional capital funds are provided by csc as equity investments and also as subordinated loans in a form approved as regulatory capital by regulators for csco the details and method used for each cash infusion are based on an analysis of the particular entity’s needs and financing alternatives the amounts and structure of infusions must take into consideration maintenance of regulatory capital requirements debtequity ratios and equity double leverage ratios 

schwab conducts regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various adverse macroeconomic and companyspecific events to which the company could be subjected the objective of the capital stress testing is 1 to explore various potential outcomes – including rare and extreme events and 2 to assess impacts of potential stressful outcomes on both capital and liquidity additionally we have a comprehensive capital contingency plan to provide action plans for certain low probabilityhigh impact capital events that the company might face the capital contingency plan is issued under the authority of the financial risk oversight committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events it

does not specifically address every contingency but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress the results of the stress testing indicate there are two scenarios which could stress the company’s capital 1 inflows of balance sheet cash during a period of very low interest rates and 2 outflows of balance sheet cash when other sources of financing are not available and the company is required to sell assets to fund the flows at a loss the capital contingency plan is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate

regulatory capital requirements 

csc is subject to capital requirements set by the federal reserve and is required to serve as a source of strength for schwab bank and to provide financial assistance if schwab bank experiences financial distress schwab is required to maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio for csc of at least 4 however management seeks to maintain the ratio of at least 6 due to the relatively low risk of our balance sheet assets and riskbased capital ratios at csc and schwab bank that are well in excess of regulatory requirements the tier 1 leverage ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on csc’s asset growth 

banking subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements set by their regulators that are substantially similar to those imposed on csc by the federal reserve banking subsidiaries’ failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that could have a direct material effect on the bank schwab’s principal banking subsidiary schwab bank is required to maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 to be well capitalized but seeks to maintain the ratio of at least 625 based on its regulatory capital ratios at december 31 2017  schwab bank is considered well capitalized 

the following table details csc’s consolidated and schwab bank’s capital ratios 



1   csc and schwab bank have elected to optout of the requirement to include most components of aoci in cet1 capital 

schwab bank is also subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions in addition schwab bank is required to provide notice to and may be required to obtain approval from the occ and the federal reserve to declare dividends to the parent company 

as a brokerdealer csco is subject to regulatory requirements of the uniform net capital rule the rule is intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of brokerdealers these regulations prohibit csco from paying cash dividends making unsecured advances and loans to the parent company and employees and repaying subordinated borrowings from csc if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5 of aggregate debit balances or

foreign holdings 

at december 31 2017  schwab had exposure to nonsovereign financial and nonfinancial institutions in foreign countries of 57 billion  with the fair value of the top three exposures being to issuers and counterparties domiciled in sweden  at 16 billion  france  at 13 billion  and canada  at 08 billion  

at december 31 2017  schwab held afs and htm securities with a total fair value of 99 million  issued by agencies of foreign governments these securities are explicitly guaranteed by governments of issuing agencies 

in addition to the direct holdings in foreign companies and securities issued by foreign government agencies schwab has indirect exposure to foreign countries through its investments in csim money market funds collectively the funds resulting from brokerage clearing activities at december 31 2017  the company had 135 million  in investments in these funds certain of the funds’ positions include certificates of deposits time deposits commercial paper and corporate debt securities issued by counterparties in foreign countries schwab had outstanding margin loans to foreign residents of 660 million  at december 31 2017  

fair value of financial instruments 

schwab uses the market approach to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value and to determine fair value disclosures see item 8 – note 2 and note 15 for more information on our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 

when available schwab uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities when utilizing market data and bidask spread we use the price within the bidask spread that best represents fair value when quoted prices do not exist prices are obtained from independent thirdparty pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets we generally obtain prices from at least three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value our primary independent pricing service provides prices based on observable trades and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads and weightedaverage maturity for the same or similar “tobeissued” securities the prices obtained from its primary independent pricing service are compared to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable we do not adjust the prices received from independent thirdparty pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts at december 31 2017  and 2016  we did not adjust prices received from the primary independent thirdparty pricing service 

critical accounting estimates 

the consolidated financial statements of schwab have been prepared in accordance with gaap item 8 – note 2 contains more information on our significant accounting policies made in connection with its application of these accounting principles 

while the majority of the revenues expenses assets and liabilities are not based on estimates there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on schwab’s financial position and reported financial results these critical accounting estimates are described below management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy 

management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors additionally management has reviewed with the audit committee the company’s significant estimates discussed in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

income taxes 

schwab estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate including federal state and local domestic jurisdictions and immaterial amounts owed to several foreign jurisdictions the estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statements of income in taxes on income accrued taxes are reported in other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes deferred tax assets are recognized if in management’s judgment their realizability is determined to be more likely than not uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize an uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement in estimating accrued taxes we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances 

changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates interpretations of tax laws the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities and newly enacted statutory judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions these changes when they occur affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the operating results of the company see item 8 – note 19 for more information on the company’s income taxes 

legal and regulatory reserves 

reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter after considering among other factors the progress of the case prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases available defenses insurance coverage and indemnification and the opinions and views of legal counsel in many cases including most class action lawsuits it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred or to estimate the range of that loss until the matter is close to resolution in which case no accrual is made until that time reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved see item 8 – note 13 for more information on the company’s contingencies related to legal and regulatory reserves

﻿

﻿ 

basel iii capital and liquidity framework 

﻿ 

in 2013 the us federal banking agencies adopted strengthened regulatory capital requirements for us banking organizations consistent with basel iii final regulatory capital rules the final regulatory capital rules established common equity tier 1 cet1 capital as a new capital standard increased minimum required riskbased capital ratios narrowed the eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments provided for new regulatory capital deductions and adjustments and modified methods for calculating riskweighted assets the denominator of riskbased capital ratios see capital management in part ii item 7  and item 8 – note 22 for more information on capital requirements 

﻿ 

the final regulatory capital rules provided for a onetime election which csc and schwab bank made to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income aoci from the calculation of all capital ratios  the final regulatory capital rules also introduced a capital conservation buffer that limits a banking organization’s ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if a banking organization fails to maintain a capital conservation buffer of more than 25 on a fully phasedin basis in excess of all of its minimum riskbased capital ratio requirements 

﻿ 

the final regulatory capital rules provide for a “standardized approach” framework for the calculation of a banking organization’s regulatory capital and riskweighted assets depository institutions and their holding companies with consolidated total assets of 250 billion or more or total onbalancesheet foreign exposures of 10 billion or more are also required to calculate their regulatory capital and riskweighted assets using an “advanced approaches” framework and must satisfy the minimum capital ratios under both approaches such companies must also maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of at least 30 and are subject to certain other enhanced provisions csc and schwab bank are currently only subject to the “standardized approach” framework

﻿ 

the company faces a variety of risks that may affect its operations  financial results or stock price and many of those risks are driven by factors that the company cannot control or predict the following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant although there may be other risks that could arise or may prove to be more significant than expected that may affect the company’s operations or financial results

﻿ 

developments in the business economic and geopolitical environment could negatively impact the company’s business 

﻿ 

the company’s business can be adversely affected by the general environment – economic corporate securities market regulatory and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations trading activity interest rates and overall investor engagement and are outside of the company’s control deterioration in the housing and credit markets reductions 

 9  

 

the charles schwab corporation 

  

  

in shortterm interest rates and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact the company’s results of operations and capital resources 

﻿ 

extensive regulation of the company’s businesses may subject it to significant penalties or limitations on business activities  

﻿ 

as a participant in the securities banking and financial services industries the company is subject to extensive regulation under federal state and foreign laws by governmental agencies supervisory authorities and sros such regulation continues to grow more extensive and complex the costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase and regulatory proceedings continue to become more frequent and sanctions more severe the requirements imposed by the company’s regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets the safety and soundness of financial institutions and the protection of clients these regulations affect the company’s business operations and impose capital client protection and market conduct requirements 

﻿ 

in addition to specific banking laws and regulations the company’s banking regulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies and could require csc andor schwab bank to hold more capital increase liquidity or limit their ability to pay dividends or csc’s ability to repurchase shares the banking regulators could also limit the company’s ability to grow including adding assets launching new products making acquisitions and undertaking strategic investments could limit schwab bank’s ability to accept deposits swept from client brokerage accounts and brokered deposits and could prevent the company from pursuing its business strategy 

﻿ 

despite the company’s efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements there are a number of risks particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by the company’s regulators against the company or its affiliates officers or employees could result in fines penalties cease and desist orders enforcement actions suspension disqualification or expulsion or other disciplinary sanctions including limitations on the company’s business activities any of which could harm the company’s reputation and adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

﻿ 

while the company maintains systems and procedures designed to ensure that it complies with applicable laws and regulations violations could occur in addition some legalregulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time there may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance including restrictions on certain activities such a finding may also damage the company’s reputation and its relationships with its regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in the company’s securities 

﻿ 

legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect the company’s business and financial results 

﻿ 

new legislation rules regulations and guidance or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal state foreign and sro rules regulations and guidance including changes relating to mutual funds brokerdealer fiduciary duties and regulatory treatment of deposit accounts may directly affect the operation and profitability of the company or its specific business lines the profitability of the company could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally including changes to the laws governing taxation electronic commerce client privacy and security of client data in addition the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business the company conducts modifications to the company’s business practices more stringent capital and liquidity requirements  increased deposit insurance assessments or additional costs   these changes may also require the company to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to its compliance risk management treasury and operations functions 

﻿ 

while us banking regulators have finalized many regulations to implement various provisions of doddfrank and other financial reforms such as basel iii implementation of the legislation is ongoing and significant rulemaking and interpretations remain to be completed for example rules relating to a minimum net stable funding ratio nsfr    which will require financial institutions to have a stable funding structure over a oneyear horizon have been proposed but have not yet been finalized in addition the sec was given discretion to adopt rules regarding standards of conduct for brokerdealers providing investment advice to retail clients but has not yet made any rule proposals the company has incurred and will

the charles schwab corporation 

  

  

continue to incur significant additional costs and expend a significant amount of time as it develops and integrates appropriate systems and procedures to comply with the rulemaking and then monitors supports and refines those systems and procedures 

﻿ 

failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect the company’s financial condition 

﻿ 

csc together with schwab bank and its brokerdealer subsidiaries must meet certain capital and liquidity standards subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of the company’s capital and the company’s internal assessment of its capital needs the uniform net capital rule limits schwab’s ability to transfer capital to csc and other affiliates new regulatory capital liquidity and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how the company utilizes its capital including paying dividends and stock repurchases and may require the company to increase its capital andor liquidity or to limit its growth failure by either csc or schwab bank to meet its minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have a negative impact on the company in addition failure by csc or schwab bank to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy its capital conservation buffer requirements as phased in would result in restrictions on the company’s ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers   any requirement that the company increase its regulatory capital replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as tier 1 capital or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could require the company to liquidate assets deleverage or otherwise change its business andor investment plans which may adversely affect its financial results issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders 

﻿ 

with  223 billion in consolidated total assets at december 31 2016 the company is currently only subject to the “standardized approach” framework of the basel iii capital and liquidity requirements when the company’s consolidated total assets equal or exceed 250 billion the company will become subject to the “advanced approaches” framework including being subject to a supplementary leverage ratio the inclusion of aoci in regulatory capital the unmodified lcr enhanced basel iii disclosures and a more complex calculation of risk weighted assets that includes an assessment of the impact of operational risk in addition federal banking agencies have broad discretion and could require csc or schwab bank to hold higher levels of capital or increase liquidity above the applicable regulatory requirements 

﻿ 

for a discussion of the company’s liquidity and capital management see risk management and capital management in part ii item 7 and item 8 – note 22 

﻿ 

significant interest rate changes could affect the company’s profitability 

﻿ 

the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in earnings a decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on the company’s net interest revenue a low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact on the company’s asset management and administration fee revenues if the company has to waive a portion of its management fees for certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds in order to continue providing a positive return to clients 

﻿ 

overall the company is positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment a rise in interest rates may cause the company’s funding costs to increase if market conditions or the competitive environment forces the company to raise its interest rates to avoid losing deposits higher funding costs without offsetting increases in yields on interestearning assets can reduce the company’s net interest revenue 

﻿

security breaches of the company’s systems or those of its clients or third parties may subject the company to significant liability and damage the company’s reputation

the company’s business involves the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential information about the company and its clients information security risks for financial institutions are increasing in part because of the use of the internet and mobile technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime activists hackers and other external parties including foreign state actors the company’s systems and those of other financial institutions have been and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber   attacks malicious code computer viruses

and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access misuse loss or destruction of data including confidential client information account takeovers unavailability of service or other events despite the company’s efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems the company may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means for example employee misconduct 

﻿ 

security breaches including breaches of the company’s security measures or those of the company’s thirdparty service providers or clients could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject the company to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance actions by the company’s regulators damage to the company’s reputation or a loss of confidence in the company’s security measures which could harm the company’s business the company may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures 

﻿ 

the company also faces risk related to external fraud involving the compromise of clients’ personal electronic devices that can facilitate the unauthorized access to login and password information for their various online financial accounts including those at the company such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties including foreign statesponsored parties for example these parties send fraudulent “phishing” emails to the company’s clients in order to misappropriate user names passwords or other personal information losses reimbursed to clients under the company’s guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

﻿ 

technology and operational failures or errors could subject the company to losses litigation and regulatory actions 

﻿ 

the company must process record and monitor a large number of transactions and its operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its systems system interruptions errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes including changes in client use patterns technological failure changes to its systems linkages with thirdparty systems and power failures and can have a significant impact on the company’s business and operations the company’s systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error execution errors errors in models such as those used for asset management capital planning and management risk management stress testing and compliance employee misconduct unauthorized trading external fraud computer viruses distributed denial of service attacks cyber   attacks terrorist attacks natural disaster power outage capacity constraints software flaws events impacting key business partners and vendors and similar events for example the company and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have in certain circumstances made websites mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time it could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to the company’s technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence which could affect the company’s ability to process and settle client transactions moreover instances of fraud or other misconduct might also negatively impact the company’s reputation and client confidence in the company in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances despite the company’s efforts to identify areas of risk oversee operational areas involving risk and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer unexpected losses reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors including those of its vendors or other third parties 

﻿ 

while the company devotes substantial attention and resources to the reliability capacity and scalability of its systems extraordinary trading volumes could cause the company’s computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail affecting the company’s ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients’ orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses and decreased client satisfaction the company is also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges clearing houses and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement systems failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices cause substantial losses for the company and for its clients and subject the company to claims from its clients for damages

a significant decrease in the   company’s liquidity could negatively affect the company’s business and financial management as well as reduce client confidence in the company 

﻿ 

maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to the business operations of the company including margin lending mortgage lending and transaction settlement among other liquidity needs the company meets its liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by client activity and operating earnings as well as cash provided by external financing fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances as well as changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits or market conditions may affect the company’s ability to meet its liquidity needs a reduction in the company’s liquidity position could reduce client confidence in the company which could result in the loss of client accounts or could cause the company to fail to satisfy its liquidity requirements including the modified lcr in addition if the company’s brokerdealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to csc which could reduce csc’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt and pay cash dividends in addition csc may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries 

﻿ 

factors which may adversely affect the company’s liquidity position include schwab having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances unanticipated outflows of company cash fluctuations in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts a dramatic increase in the company’s client lending activities including margin mortgagerelated and personal lending increased capital requirements changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations other regulatory changes or a loss of market or client confidence in the company 

﻿ 

when cash generated by client activity and operating earnings is not sufficient for the company’s liquidity needs the company may seek external financing during periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets potential sources of external financing could be reduced and borrowing costs could increase although csc and schwab maintain committed and uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines and csc has a commercial paper issuance program as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec which can be used to sell securities financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets in addition a significant downgrade in the company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets

﻿ 

the company’s businesses are subject to the risk that a client counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate while the company has policies and procedures designed to manage this risk the policies and procedures may not be fully effective the company’s exposure mainly results from margin lending clients’ options trading futures activities securities lending mortgage lending pledged asset lending its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds the company sponsors 

﻿ 

when clients purchase securities on margin borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities or trade options or futures the company is subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients’ indebtedness abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses 

﻿ 

the company has exposure to credit risk associated with its investments   those investments are subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial market’s assessment of credit quality loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such securities are other than temporarily impaired the evaluation of whether otherthantemporary impairment otti exists is a matter of judgment which includes the assessment of several factors if management determines that a security is otti  the cost basis of the security may be adjusted and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings deterioration in the performance of available for sale afs and held to maturity htm securities could result in the recognition of future impairment charges even if a security is not considered otti  if the company was ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs the company would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time see critical accounting estimates in part ii   item 7 for additional information

2016 compared to 2015 

﻿ 

in 2016 net income available to common stockholders increased 382 million or 28 from the prior year resulting in diluted eps of 131 in 2016 compared to 103 in 2015 net revenues improved by 11 billion or 17 while expenses excluding interest increased 384 million or 9 compared to 2015 

﻿ 

strong client momentum continued as the company’s innovative fullservice model resonated with clients and drove growth during the year the company added 11 million new brokerage accounts to its client base during 2016   which contributed to bringing the total active brokerage accounts to 102 million by yearend  core net new assets from new and existing clients totaled 1255 billion in 2016  which helped grow total client assets to 278 trillion as of december 31 2016 also during 2016 investors increasingly turned to the company’s advice offerings resulting in a 12 increase in client assets enrolled in one of the company’s retail advisory solutions and those guided by independent advisors  to 140 trillion at the end of the year  

﻿ 

the company expanded client assets by 11 during an environment that had periods of marked volatility but ultimately included improving economic conditions the standard  poor’s 500 index ended 2016 10 higher than the prior year end after years of ultralow interest rates the federal reserve’s move to increase the overnight federal funds target rate by 25 basis points in december 2015 helped throughout 2016 the federal reserve’s subsequent additional 25 basis point increase in december 2016 had little time to impact 2016 results other shortterm rates also rose in 2016 the onemonth london interbank offered rate libor improved 34 basis points to 77 at december 31 2016 compared to december 31 2015 

﻿ 

these external drivers and the solid client growth helped produce strong net revenue growth the company’s 17 net revenue growth was led by increased net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees which more than offset lower revenue from trading and other revenue net interest revenue improved 797 million or 32 in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a 21 increase in average interest earning assets and a 13 basis point improvement in the average net interest margin from year to year to 173 the lift in interestearning assets was due to a combination of the company’s ongoing asset gathering efforts additional bulk transfers of client cash sweep balances from money market funds to schwab bank and the designation of schwab bank as the default sweep option for virtually all new brokerage accounts as of june 2016 asset management and administration fees improved 405 million or 15 primarily due to higher shortterm interest rates affecting the yield on money market funds 

﻿ 

strong net revenue growth provided room for increased investment in people and technology resulting in a 9 expense growth for 2016 this increase allowed for a 780 basis point gap between net revenue and expense growth and a pretax profit margin of 400 in 2016 compared to 357 in 2015 

﻿ 

2015 compared to 2014 

﻿ 

in 2015 the company’s net revenue and net income grew despite an environment that included significant equity market volatility and continued low interest rates the standard  poor’s 500 index declined as much as 9 during the year and ultimately ended the year down 1 when compared to the prior year the overnight federal funds target rate increased 2 5 basis points in december 2015 however the increase had limited effect on 2015 results the year end 2015 one month libor yield improved 28 basis points to  43  compared to 2014 longterm interest rates decreased in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 the average 10year us treasury yield during 2015 was 213 40 basis points lower than the average yield during 2014 

﻿ 

core net new assets totaled 1347 billion in 2015 compared to 1248 billion in 2014 total client assets ended 2015 at 251 trillion up 2 from the year ended 2014 despite the 892 billion impact of reduced market valuation on client assets during the year 

﻿ 

the company added 11 million new brokerage accounts to its client base during 2015 up 10 compared to 2014 active brokerage accounts ended 2015 at 98 million up 4 on a yearoveryear basis faced with economic uncertainty and the resulting market volatility investors increasingly turned to advice offerings throughout the year over 155000 accounts enrolled in one of the company’s retail advisory solutions during 2015 60 more than the yearearlier period and total accounts using these solutions reached 560000 up 14 yearoveryear

﻿ 

asset management and administration fees increased by 405 million or 15 in 2016 from 2015 and by 117 million or 5 in 2015 from 2014    the increases in both years were due to higher net yields on money market fund assets as shortterm interest rates rose in 2016 and 2015  and growth in client assets enrolled in advisory offers partially offset by a reduction in client assets in mutual fund onesource 

﻿ 

the average fee rate on advice solutions decreased in 2016 and 2015 from the prior years primarily due to the growth in intelligent portfolios which do not charge advisory fees 

  

net interest revenue 

﻿ 

the company’s primary interestearning assets include cash and cash equivalents segregated cash and investments margin loans which constitute the majority of receivables from brokerage clients investment securities and bank loans revenue on interestearning assets is affected by various factors such as the composition of assets prevailing interest rates at the time of origination or purchase changes in interest rates on floating rate securities and changes in prepayment levels for mortgage related securities and loans  fees earned on securities borrowing and lending activities which are conducted by the

company’s brokerdealer subsidiaries on assets held in client brokerage accounts are included in other interest revenue and expense 

﻿ 

the company’s interestbearing liabilities include bank deposits payables to brokerage clients shortterm borrowings and longterm debt the company establishes the rates paid on clientrelated liabilities and management expects that it will generally adjust the rates paid on these liabilities at some fraction of any movement in shortterm rates clientrelated liabilities have historically been very stable and are largely expected to remain so given the stability and low rate sensitivity of these liabilities management believes their duration is relatively long somewhere in excess of three and a half years 

﻿ 

management believes that the extended period of extraordinarily low interest rates running from the financial crisis to the present has likely resulted in certain sweep cash balances retaining some level of latent rate sensitivity to the extent shortterm rates increase management expects some sweep cash balances to migrate to purchased money market funds or other higheryielding alternatives at the same time the company will retain the opportunity to migrate the remaining nonrate sensitive cash in sweep money market funds to schwab bank 

﻿ 

management has positioned the company to benefit from an increase in interest rates especially shortterm interest rates by managing the duration of interestearning assets to be shorter than that of interestbearing liabilities so that asset yields will move faster than liability costs 

﻿ 

in order to keep the company’s interestrate sensitivity within established limits management monitors and responds to changes in the balance sheet as the company builds its client base it attracts a significant amount of new client sweep cash which along with the bulk transfer of existing sweep cash balances from money market funds is a primary driver of balance sheet growth as the proportion of sweep cash balances to total liabilities has grown the measured duration of liabilities has grown as well by increasing the duration of interestearning assets as necessary management has kept the company positioned to continue to gain from increasing rates while limiting its exposure to falling rates to an acceptable level management currently manages the balance sheet so that just over half of the company’s investment securities and loans reprice or reset based on shortterm interest rates such as one month libor   

﻿ 

noninterestbearing funding sources include certain cash balances stockholders’ equity and other miscellaneous assets and liabilities

﻿ 

market risk 

﻿ 

market risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by the company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices  or market conditions 

﻿ 

the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on its interestearning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources that finance these assets the majority of the company’s interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities are sensitive to changes in shortterm interest rates a portion of the company’s investment portfolios is sensitive to changes in longterm interest rates 

﻿ 

net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets primarily include investment securities margin loans and bank loans these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment because the company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin loans and bank loans and controls the composition of its investment securities it has some ability to manage its net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions 

﻿ 

to mitigate the risk of declining interest revenue the company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interestearning assets and funding sources to remain within these guidelines the company manages the maturity repricing and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios 

﻿ 

financial instruments held by the company are also subject to the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument   the company is indirectly exposed to option futures and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers and client securities loaned out as part of the company’s brokerage securities lending activities equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity margin borrowing and overall client

engagement with the company additionally the company earns mutual fund and etf service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the company 

﻿ 

the company’s market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material 

﻿ 

net interest revenue simulation 

﻿ 

for the company’s net interest revenue sensitivity analysis the company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulation includes all interestsensitive assets and liabilities key variables in the simulation include the repricing of financial instruments prepayment reinvestment and product pricing assumptions the company uses constant balances and market rates in the simulation assumptions in order to minimize the number of variables and to better isolate risks the simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and as a result cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies including changes in asset and liability mix 

﻿ 

if the company’s guidelines for its net interest revenue sensitivity are breached management must report the breach to the company’s corporate assetliability management and pricing committee and establish a plan to address the interest rate risk there were no breaches of the company’s net interest revenue sensitivity guidelines during the years ended december 31 2016 or 2015 

﻿ 

as represented by the simulations presented below the company’s investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall 

﻿ 

t he simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as the company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood the company would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the simulated net interest revenue change over the next 12 months beginning december 31 2016 and 2015 of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period 

﻿ 



﻿ 

the change in net interest revenue sensitivities as of december 31 2016 reflects the increase in interest rates across all terms the low client deposit rates under current federal fund levels limits the extent to which the company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources a decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the company’s investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense further compressing net interest margin the increase of shortterm interest rates positively impacts net interest revenue as yields on interestearning assets rise faster than the cost of funding sources 

﻿ 

liquidity risk 

﻿ 

liquidity risk is the potential that the company will be unable to sell assets or meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses 

﻿ 

due to its role as a source of financial strength csc’s liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of the brokerage subsidiaries the capital needs of schwab bank the amount of dividend payments on csc’s common and preferred stock and principal and interest due on corporate debt the liquidity needs of its brokerage subsidiaries are

primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin borrowing activities and capital expenditures and the capital needs of its bank subsidiary are primarily driven by client deposits 

﻿ 

the company has established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of its business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet its operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stress conditions the company seeks to maintain client confidence in its balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the company to meet its obligations to this end the company has established limits and contingency funding scenarios to support liquidity levels during both expected and stressed scenarios 

﻿ 

the company employs a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity the company conducts regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure the company’s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during marketrelated or companyspecific liquidity stress events liquidity is also tested at key subsidiaries and results are reported on a monthly basis to the company’s corporate assetliability management and pricing committee a number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the company and are reviewed with management as appropriate 

﻿ 

beginning on january 1 2016 the company became subject to the modified lcr rule which w as fully phased in on january 1 2017 and require s csc to hold hqlas equal to at least 70 of projected net cash outflows over a 30day period as defined by the rule at december 31 2016 the company was in compliance with the fully phasedin modified lcr rule 

﻿ 

primary funding sources 

﻿ 

the company’s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts in 2016 bank deposits swept from brokerage accounts increased  330 billion  these funds were used to purchase investment securities thereby funding a significant portion of the 22  growth in the company’s consolidated balance sheet 

﻿ 

other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations maturities and sales of investment securities repayments on loans securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts and cash provided by external financing or equity offerings 

﻿ 

to meet daily funding needs the company maintains liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and shortterm investments for unanticipated liquidity needs the company maintains a buffer of highly liquid investments currently comprised of us treasury notes 

﻿ 

additional funding sources 

﻿ 

in addition to internal sources of liquidity the company has sources of external funding csc maintains a 750 million committed unsecured credit facility with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in june 2017 other than an overnight borrowing to test the availability of this facility it was unused during 2016 the funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes the financial covenants require schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio schwab bank to be well capitalized and csc to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity adjusted to exclude aoci at december 31 2016 the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was  102 billion csc’s stockholders’ equity excluding aoci at december 31 2016 was  166 billion management believes these restrictions will not have a material effect on csc’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements 

﻿ 

csc and schwab also have access to uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines with several banks the need for shortterm borrowings from these sources arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements scheduled liquidation of interestearning investments and movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements these lines were not used by csc during 2016 schwab used such borrowings for one day in 2016 for 15 million and   there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at december 31 2016

﻿ 

when available the company uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities when utilizing market data and bidask spread the company uses the price within the bidask spread that best represents fair value when quoted prices do not exist the company uses prices obtained from independent thirdparty pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets the company generally obtains prices from at least three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value the company’s primary independent pricing service provides prices based on observable trades and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads and weightedaverage maturity for the same or similar “tobeissued” securities the company compares the prices obtained from its primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable the company does not adjust the prices received from independent thirdparty pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts at december 31 2016 and 2015 the company did not adjust prices received from the primary independent thirdparty pricing service

otherthantemporary impairment of investment securities 

﻿ 

the company internally conducts prepurchase analyses and ongoing postpurchase monitoring of investments that it owns the company assigns a risk rating to each issuer of the securities in the company’s investment securities portfolio based on these analyses on an ongoing basis the company monitors credit indicators related to its securities portfolio and adjusts the internal ratings accordingly 

﻿ 

management evaluates whether investment securities are otti on a quarterly basis debt securities with unrealized losses are considered otti if the company intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such security before any anticipated recovery if management determines that a security is otti under these circumstances the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between the amortized cost and the thencurrent fair value 

﻿ 

a security is also otti if management does not expect to recover the amortized cost of the security in this circumstance the impairment recognized in earnings represents the estimated credit loss and is measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security management utilizes cash flow models to estimate the expected future cash flow from the securities and to estimate the credit loss expected cash flows are discounted using the security’s effective interest rate 

﻿ 

the evaluation of whether the company expects to recover the amortized cost of a security is inherently judgmental the evaluation includes the consideration of multiple factors including the magnitude and duration of the unrealized loss the financial condition of the issuer the payment structure of the security external credit ratings internal credit ratings for assetbacked securities the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security to absorb credit losses on the underlying collateral recent events specific to the issuer and the issuer’s industry and whether the company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments 

﻿ 

valuation of goodwill 

﻿ 

the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever indications of impairment exist impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value resulting in an impairment charge for this excess adverse changes in the company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition a loss of key personnel the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the company’s recorded goodwill 

﻿ 

the company can elect to qualitatively assess goodwill for impairment if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value a qualitative assessment considers macroeconomic and other industryspecific factors such as trends in shortterm and longterm interest rates and the ability to access capital and company specific factors such as market capitalization in excess of net assets trends in revenue generating activities and merger or acquisition activity if the company elects to bypass qualitatively assessing goodwill or it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value management estimates the fair values of each of the company’s reporting units defined as the company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management and compares it to their carrying values the estimated fair values of the reporting units are established using an income approach based on a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit a market approach which compares each reporting unit to comparable companies in their respective industries as well as a market capitalization analysis 

﻿ 

the company’s annual goodwill impairment testing date is april 1 st  in 2016 the company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment as of april 1 2016 the company determined through quantitative testing that the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value of each of the company’s reporting units and concluded that goodwill was not impaired

allowance for loan losses 

﻿ 

the appropriateness of the allowance is reviewed quarterly by management taking into consideration current economic conditions the existing loan portfolio composition past loss experience and risks inherent in the portfolios 

﻿ 

the methodology to establish an allowance for loan losses related to the first mortgage and heloc portfolios utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments defaults and probable losses for the loan types based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the types  the methodology considers the effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including but not limited to interest rates housing price movements as measured by a housing price index economic conditions estimated defaults and foreclosures measured by historical and expected delinquencies changes in prepayment speeds ltv ratios past loss experience estimates of future loss severities borrower credit risk and the adequacy of collateral the methodology also evaluates concentrations in the loan types including loan products within those types  year of origination and geographical distribution of collateral 

﻿ 

probable losses are forecast using a loanlevel simulation of the delinquency status of the loans over the term of the loans the simulation starts with the current relevant risk indicators including the current delinquent status of each loan the estimated current ltv ratio of each loan the term and structure of each loan current key interest rates including us treasury and libor rates and borrower fico scores the more significant variables in the simulation include delinquency roll rates loss severity housing prices and interest rates delinquency roll rates are estimated from the company’s historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information loss severity estimates are based on the company’s historical loss experience and market trends the estimated loss severity ie loss given default used in the allowance for loan loss for helocs is higher than that used for first mortgages housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values factors affecting the home price index include housing inventory unemployment interest rates and inflation expectations interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths this methodology results in loss factors that are applied to the outstanding balances to determine the allowance for loan loss for each loan type  

﻿ 

legal and regulatory reserves 

﻿

the final regulatory capital rules provided for a onetime election which csc and schwab bank made to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income aoci from the calculation of cet1 capital the final regulatory capital rules also introduced a capital conservation buffer that limits a banking organization’s ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if a banking organization fails to maintain a capital conservation buffer of more than 25 on a fully phasedin basis in excess of all of its minimum riskbased capital ratio requirements 

  

the final regulatory capital rules provide for a “standardized approach” framework for the calculation of a banking organization’s regulatory capital and riskweighted assets depository institutions and their holding companies with consolidated total assets of 250 billion or more or total onbalancesheet foreign exposures of 10 billion or more are also required to calculate their regulatory capital requirements using an “advanced approaches” framework to determine their riskweighted assets such companies must also maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of at least 30 and are subject to certain other enhanced provisions csc and schwab bank are currently only subject to the “standardized approach” framework

the fdic’s deposit insurance fund dif provides insurance coverage for certain deposits generally up to 250000 per depositor per account ownership type and is funded by quarterly assessments on insured depository institutions in february 2011 the fdic established a riskbased deposit premium assessment system that for large insured depository institutions with at least 10 billion in total consolidated assets such as schwab bank uses a scorecard method based on a number of factors including the institution’s regulatory ratings asset quality and brokered deposits the deposit insurance assessment base is calculated as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity 

  

the doddfrank act i raised the minimum reserve ratio for the dif to 135 from the former minimum of 115 and ii required that the dif’s reserve ratio reach 135 by september 30 2020 

  

in october 2015 the fdic issued a proposed rule that would impose a flatrate surcharge on the quarterly assessments of insured depository institutions with total assets of 10 billion or more to pay for the increase see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – current regulatory environment and other developments”

risk factors 

tableend

  

the company faces a variety of risks that may affect its operations or financial results and many of those risks are driven by factors that the company cannot control or predict the following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant although there may be other risks that could arise or may prove to be more significant than expected that may affect the company’s operations or financial results 

  

for a discussion of the company’s risk management including operational risk credit risk market risk liquidity risk compliance risk and legal risk see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – risk management” 

  

developments in the business economic and geopolitical environment could negatively impact the company’s business 

  

the company’s business can be adversely affected by the general environment – economic corporate securities market regulatory and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations trading activity interest rates and overall investor engagement and are outside of the company’s control deterioration in the housing and credit markets reductions

the charles schwab corporation 

in shortterm interest rates and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact the company’s results of operations and capital resources 

  

extensive regulation of the company’s businesses affects the company’s activities and may subject it to significant penalties 

  

as a participant in the securities banking and financial services industries the company is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws by governmental agencies supervisory authorities and sros such regulation continues to grow more extensive and complex the costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase and regulatory proceedings continue to become more frequent and sanctions more severe the requirements imposed by the company’s regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets the safety and soundness of financial institutions and the protection of clients these regulations affect the company’s business operations and impose capital client protection and market conduct requirements 

  

in addition to specific banking laws and regulations the company’s banking regulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies and could require csc andor schwab bank to hold more capital increase liquidity or limit their ability to pay dividends or csc’s ability to repurchase shares the banking regulators could also limit the company’s ability to grow including adding assets launching new products and undertaking strategic investments could limit schwab bank’s ability to accept deposits swept from the client brokerage accounts and could prevent the company from pursuing its business strategy 

  

despite the company’s efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements there are a number of risks particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by the company’s regulators against the company or its affiliates officers or employees could result in fines penalties cease and desist orders enforcement actions suspension or expulsion or other disciplinary sanctions including limitations on the company’s business activities any of which could harm the company’s reputation and adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

while the company maintains systems and procedures designed to ensure that it complies with applicable laws and regulations violations could occur in addition some legalregulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time there may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance including restrictions on certain activities such a finding may also damage the company’s reputation and its relationships with its regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in the company’s securities 

  

legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect the company’s business and financial results 

  

new legislation rules regulations and guidance or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal state and sro rules regulations and guidance including changes relating to mutual funds brokerdealer fiduciary duties and regulatory treatment of deposit accounts may directly affect the operation and profitability of the company or its specific business lines the profitability of the company could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally including changes to the laws governing taxation electronic commerce client privacy and security of client data in addition the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business the company conducts modifications to the company’s business practices increased capital requirements or additional costs 

  

financial reforms and related regulations may affect the company’s business activities financial position and profitability 

  

there have been extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms as a result of the enactment of doddfrank and the adoption by the federal banking agencies of regulations implementing doddfrank and other reforms such as basel iii among the changes that are most likely to impact the company’s business and financial results are increased capital liquidity and reporting requirements increased deposit insurance assessments the establishment of the cfpb which has broad rulemaking supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products the requirement for schwab bank and csc starting in 2017 to conduct annual capital adequacy stress tests and discretion given to the sec to adopt 

 10  

 

the charles schwab corporation 

rules regarding standards of conduct for brokerdealers providing investment advice to retail clients the company has incurred and will continue to incur significant additional costs and expend a significant amount of time as it develops and integrates appropriate systems and procedures and then monitors supports and refines those systems and procedures 

  

while us banking regulators have finalized many regulations to implement various provisions of doddfrank and basel iii implementation of the legislation is ongoing and significant rulemaking and interpretations remain to be completed for example rules relating to a minimum net stable funding ratio   which will require financial institutions to have a stable funding structure over a oneyear horizon have not yet been proposed 

  

future regulatory changes or revised guidance and interpretations may impact the profitability of the company’s business activities require changes to certain of its business practices impose upon the company more stringent capital liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect the company’s ability to pursue its business strategies these changes may also require the company to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to its compliance risk management and operations functions 

  

failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect the company’s financial condition 

  

csc together with schwab bank and its brokerdealer subsidiaries must meet certain capital and liquidity standards subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components risk weightings and other factors the uniform net capital rule limits schwab’s ability to transfer capital to csc and other affiliates new regulatory capital liquidity and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how the company utilizes its capital including paying dividends and stock repurchases and may require the company to increase its capital andor liquidity or to limit its growth any requirement that the company increase its regulatory capital replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as tier 1 capital or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could require the company to liquidate assets deleverage or otherwise change its business andor investment plans which may adversely affect its financial results issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders 

  

if the company’s consolidated total assets equal or exceed 250 billion the company would become subject to the advanced approaches framework of the basel iii capital and liquidity requirements including being subject to a supplementary leverage ratio the inclusion of aoci in regulatory capital and the unmodified lcr and enhanced basel iii disclosures in addition federal banking agencies have broad discretion and could require csc or schwab bank to hold higher levels of capital or increase liquidity above the applicable regulatory requirements 

  

in july 2013 the federal reserve and occ issued final regulatory capital rules which established more restrictive capital definitions higher riskweightings for certain asset classes higher minimum capital ratios and capital buffers failure by either csc or schwab bank to meet its minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have a negative impact on the company in addition failure by csc or schwab bank to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy its capital conservation buffer requirements as phased in would result in restrictions on the company’s ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers further in september 2014 the federal reserve issued a modified lcr that requires csc to maintain a sufficient amount of hqla in relation to total projected net cash outflows over a 30day stress period  

  

for a discussion of the company’s liquidity and capital management see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity” and “capital management” and “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to the consolidated financial statements – 23 regulatory requirements” 

  

technology and operational failures or errors could subject the company to losses litigation and regulatory actions 

  

the company faces operational risk which is the potential for loss due to inadequate or failed internal processes systems and firms or exchanges handling client orders or from external events and relationships impacting the company andor any of its key business partners and vendors this risk also includes the risk of human error execution errors errors in models such as those used for asset management capital planning and management risk management stress testing and compliance employee misconduct unauthorized trading external fraud computer viruses distributed denial of service attacks terrorist attacks natural disaster power outage capacity constraints software flaws and similar events for example the company and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have in certain circumstances

the charles schwab corporation 

made websites mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time it could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to the company’s technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen event which could affect the company’s ability to process and settle client transactions moreover instances of fraud or other misconduct might also negatively impact the company’s reputation and client confidence in the company in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances despite the company’s efforts to identify areas of risk oversee operational areas involving risk and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer unexpected losses reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors including those of its vendors or other third parties 

  

while the company devotes substantial attention and resources to the reliability capacity and scalability of its systems extraordinary trading volumes could cause the company’s computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail affecting the company’s ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients’ orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses and decreased client satisfaction the company is also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges clearing houses and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement systems failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices cause substantial losses for the company and for its clients and subject the company to claims from its clients for damages 

  

a significant decrease in the   company’s liquidity could negatively affect the company’s business and financial management as well as reduce client confidence in the company 

  

maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to the business operations of the company including margin lending mortgage lending and transaction settlement among other liquidity needs the company meets its liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by client activity and operating earnings as well as cash provided by external financing fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances as well as changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits or market conditions may affect the company’s ability to meet its liquidity needs a reduction in the company’s liquidity position could reduce client confidence in the company which could result in the loss of client accounts or could cause the company to fail to satisfy its liquidity requirements in addition if the company’s brokerdealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to csc which could reduce csc’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt and pay cash dividends in addition csc may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries 

  

factors which may adversely affect the company’s liquidity position include fluctuations in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts a dramatic increase in the company’s client lending activities including margin mortgagerelated and personal lending unanticipated outflows of company cash increased capital requirements changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations other regulatory changes or a loss of market or client confidence in the company schwab may also experience temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances 

  

when cash generated by client activity and operating earnings is not sufficient for the company’s liquidity needs the company must seek external financing during periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets potential sources of external financing could be reduced and borrowing costs could increase although csc and schwab maintain committed and uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines and csc has a commercial paper issuance program as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec which can be used to sell securities financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets in addition a significant downgrade in the company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets 

  

the company may suffer significant losses from its credit exposures 

  

the company’s businesses are subject to the risk that a client counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate while the company has policies and procedures designed to manage this risk the policies and procedures may not be fully effective the company’s exposure mainly results from margin lending clients’ options trading securities lending mortgage lending pledged asset 

 12  

 

the charles schwab corporation 

lending its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds the company sponsors 

  

when clients purchase securities on margin borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities or trade options or futures the company is subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients’ indebtedness abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses 

  

the company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale and securities held to maturity portfolios which include us agency and nonagency mortgagebacked securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities us agency notes certificates of deposit and commercial paper among other investments these instruments are also subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial market’s assessment of issuer credit quality increases in the unemployment rate delinquency and default rates housing price declines changes in prevailing interest rates and other economic factors a failure to raise the us debt limit andor a downgrade of the us government’s credit rating could decrease the value of the company’s securities in both the available for sale and held to maturity portfolios 

  

loss of value of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such securities are other than temporarily impaired the evaluation of whether otherthantemporary impairment otti exists is a matter of judgment which includes the assessment of several factors if management determines that a security is otherthantemporarily impaired the cost basis of the security may be adjusted and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings deterioration in the performance of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity could result in the recognition of future impairment charges see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting estimates” 

  

the company’s bank loans primarily consist of first mortgages helocs and pals increases in delinquency and default rates housing and stock price declines increases in the unemployment rate and other economic factors can result in charges for loan loss reserves and write downs on such loans 

  

heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments concentration risk can increase the company’s risk of loss examples of the company’s credit concentration risk include 







  

the company may also be subject to concentration risk when lending to a particular counterparty borrower or issuer 

  

the company sponsors a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds although the company has no obligation to do so the company may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit liquidity or other support to its funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity such support could cause the company to take significant charges could reduce the company’s liquidity and in certain situations could with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds result in the company having to consolidate a supported fund in its financial statements if the company chose not to provide credit liquidity or other support in such a situation the company could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected 

  

significant interest rate changes could affect the company’s profitability and financial condition 

  

the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interestearning assets such as cash equivalents short and longterm investments and mortgage and margin loans relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources including bank deposits and cash in brokerage accounts shortterm borrowings and longterm debt changes in interest rates can affect the interest earned on interestearning assets differently than the interest the company pays on its interestbearing liabilities in addition certain funding sources do not bear interest and their cost therefore does not vary overall the company is positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment the company could be adversely affected by a decline in interest rates if the rates the company earns on interestearning assets decline more than 

 13  

 

the charles schwab corporation 

the rates that the company pays on its funding sources or if prepayment rates increase on the mortgages and mortgagebacked securities the company holds the company may also be limited in the amount it can reduce interest rates on funding sources such as deposit accounts and still offer a competitive return 

  

as a result of the low interest rate environment the company has been waiving and may continue to waive a portion of its management fees for certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds to the extent the overall yield on certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds remains at or below the management fees on those funds the company may waive a portion of its fee in order to continue providing some return to clients such fee waivers negatively impact the company’s asset management and administration fee revenues 

  

security breaches of the company’s systems or those of its clients or third parties may subject the company to significant liability and damage the company’s reputation 

  

the company’s business involves the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential information about the company and its clients information security risks for financial institutions are increasing in part because of the use of the internet and mobile technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime activists hackers and other external parties the company’s systems and those of other financial institutions have been and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks malicious code computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access misuse loss or destruction of data including confidential client information account takeovers unavailability of service or other events despite the company’s efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems the company may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means for example employee misconduct 

  

security breaches including breaches of the company’s security measures or those of the company’s thirdparty service providers or clients could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject the company to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance actions by the company’s regulators damage to the company’s reputation or a loss of confidence in the company’s security measures which could harm the company’s business the company may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures 

  

the company also faces risk related to external fraud involving the compromise of clients’ personal electronic devices that can facilitate the unauthorized access to login and password information for their various online financial accounts including those at the company such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties including foreign statesponsored parties for example these parties send fraudulent “phishing” emails to the company’s clients in order to misappropriate user names passwords or other personal information losses reimbursed to clients under the company’s guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the company is subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending itself against claims or proceedings 

  

the financial services industry faces substantial litigation and regulatory risks the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business including arbitrations class actions and other litigation some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages the company is also the subject of inquiries investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies 

  

litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by the company’s clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied at the company claims from clients of third party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors’ misconduct litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights eg patents such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources if the company were found to have infringed on a thirdparty patent or other intellectual property rights it could incur substantial damages and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology or providing certain products or services 

 14  

 

the charles schwab corporation 

actions brought against the company may result in settlements awards injunctions fines penalties or other results adverse to the company including reputational harm even if the company is successful in defending against these actions the defense of such matters may result in the company incurring significant expenses predicting the outcome of matters is inherently difficult particularly where claims are brought on behalf of various classes of claimants claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages or when investigations or legal proceedings are at an early stage a substantial judgment settlement fine or penalty could be material to the company’s operating results or cash flows for a particular future period depending on the company’s results for that period in market downturns the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased see “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – 15 commitments and contingencies” 

  

the company relies on outsourced service providers to perform key functions 

  

the company relies on external service providers to perform certain key technology processing servicing and support functions these service providers face technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of the company’s confidential client employee or company information could cause the company to incur losses and could harm the company’s reputation an interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints financial difficulties or for any other reason and the company’s inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt the company’s operations impact the company’s ability to offer certain products and services and result in financial losses to the company switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations 

  

potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on the company’s financial position 

  

the company evaluates potential strategic transactions including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions any such transaction could have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows the process of evaluating negotiating and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert management’s attention from other business concerns and might cause the loss of key clients employees and business partners moreover integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties including the need to integrate operational financial and management information systems and management controls integrate relationships with clients and business partners and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas in addition an acquisition may cause the company to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings further the company may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition and any future acquisition could be dilutive to the company’s current stockholders’ percentage ownership or to earnings per common share 

  

the company’s acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business operations or financial condition of the entity being acquired or sold to the extent the company enters into an agreement to buy or sell an entity there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected or at all if a material transaction does not close the company’s stock price could decline 

  

the company’s industry is characterized by aggressive price competition  

  

the company continually monitors its pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjusts trade commission rates interest rates on deposits and loans fees for advisory services and other fee structures to enhance its competitive position increased price competition from other financial services firms such as reduced commissions to attract trading volume or higher deposit rates to attract client cash balances could impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition to the extent that any of the company’s competitors acquires or is acquired by another institution that firm may be able to offer products and services at lower prices andor promote those products and services more aggressively 

  

the company faces competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees especially for employees who are key to the company’s ability to build and enhance client relationships 

  

the market for quality professionals and other personnel in the company’s business is highly competitive competition is strong for fcs who build and sustain the company’s client relationships and for certain risk and capital management talent

the company’s stock price can be volatile among the factors that may affect the volatility of the company’s stock price are the following 









  

changes in the stock market generally or as it concerns the company’s industry as well as geopolitical corporate regulatory business and economic factors may also affect the company’s stock price

overview 

  

management of the company focuse s on several key client activity and financial metrics in evaluating the company’s financial position and operating performance management believes that net revenue growth pretax profit margin earnings per common share eps and return on average common stockholders’ equity provide broad indicators of the company’s overall financial health operating efficiency and ability to generate acceptable returns expenses excluding interest as a percentage of average client assets are considered by management to be a measure of operating efficiency results for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 are 

  



  



  

the company’s financial results are highly correlated to the general overall strength of economic conditions and more specifically to the direction of the us equity and fixed income markets the mortgage lending markets and residential credit trends overall market conditions interest rates economic political and regulatory trends and industry competition are among the factors that could affect results and which are unpredictable  

  

interest rates have a direct correlation to the company’s ability to generate net interest revenue as interestearning assets and funding sources are sensitive to changes in the rate environment to the extent shortterm interest rates remain at current low levels the company’s net interest revenue will continue to be constrained even as growth in average balances helps to

increase such revenue net interest revenue is also impacted by the amount and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing funding sources as well as the company’s ability to attract assets from new and existing clients 

  

the interest rate environment also affects asset management and administration fees through the fees earned on the company’s lineup of proprietary money market funds  i n 2015 2014 and 2013 the low interest rate environment caused the company to waive a portion of its money fund fees to the extent that shortterm rates remain low asset management and administration fees may continue to be negatively affected other drivers of asset management and administration fees include securities valuations and the company’s ability to attract assets from new and existing clients 

  

the company generates trading revenue through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenue primarily from trading activity in client fixed income securities trading revenue is impacted by trading volumes the volatility of prices in the equity and fixed income markets and commission rates volatility in the markets can influence client behavior in terms of investment decisions and volume of trading activity

the company’s interestbearing liabilities include bank deposits payables to brokerage clients and longterm debt interestbearing liabilities are primarily sensitive to shortterm interest rates and the company establishes the rates paid on most of these liabilities the company expects that the rate paid on these liabilities will generally adjust at some fraction of the movement in shortterm market rates 

  

the company expects that net interest revenue will increase as shortterm market rates increase and decline should rates fall below current levels when interest rates fall the company may attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by lowering rates paid to clients on interestbearing liabilities the current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the company can reduce interest expense on funding sources the company may also alter the amount and type of fixed rate loans and securities that are added to the portfolio generally increases in the percentage of fixedrate assets relative to noninterestbearing liabilities will reduce the rate at which net interest revenue changes if rates move 

  

noninterest bearing funding sources include noninterest bearing cash balances stockholders’ equity and other miscellaneous assets and liabilities

capital management 

  

the company seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of its business strategy including anticipated balance sheet growth providing financial support to its subsidiaries and sustained access to the capital markets while at the same time meeting its regulatory capital requirements and serving as a source of financial strength to schwab bank the company’s primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of its subsidiaries and securities issuances by csc in the capital markets to ensure that it has a sufficient amount of capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values the company has adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios the level composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments 

  

internal guidelines are set for both the company and its regulated subsidiaries to ensure capital levels are in line with the company’s strategy and regulatory requirements and capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at capital planning and assetliability management and pricing committee meetings a number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify potential problems that could impact capital and are reviewed with management as appropriate in addition the company monitors its subsidiaries’ capital levels and requirements subject to regulatory capital requirements and any required approvals any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to csc in the form of dividends and returns when subsidiaries have need of additional capital funds are provided by csc as equity investments and also as subordinated loans in a form approved as regulatory capital by regulators for schwab the details and method used for each cash infusion are based on an analysis of the particular entity’s needs and financing alternatives the amounts and structure of infusions must take into consideration maintenance of regulatory capital requirements debtequity ratios and equity double leverage ratios 

  

the company conducts regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various plausible adverse macroeconomic and companyspecific events to which csc and its subsidiaries could be subjected the objective of the company’s capital stress testing is 1 to explore various potential outcomes – including rare and extreme events and 2 to assess impacts of potential stressful outcomes on both capital and liquidity additionally the company has a comprehensive capital contingency plan to provide action plans for certain low probabilityhigh impact capital events that the company might face the capital contingency plan is issued under the authority of the assetliability management and pricing

regulatory capital requirements 

  

beginning on january 1 2015 csc became subject to capital requirements set by the federal reserve in addition csc is required to serve as a source of strength for schwab bank and to provide financial assistance if schwab bank experiences financial distress to manage capital adequacy the company currently utilizes a target tier 1 leverage ratio for csc of at least 6 due to the relatively low risk of the company’s balance sheet assets and riskbased capital ratios at csc and schwab bank that are well in excess of regulatory requirements the tier 1 leverage ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on csc’s asset growth 

  

schwab bank is also required to maintain capital levels specified by the occ these capital requirements are substantially similar to those imposed on csc by the federal reserve schwab bank’s failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on the bank the company currently utilizes a target tier 1 leverage ratio for schwab bank of at least 625 as of january 1 2015 schwab bank became subject to the new final regulatory capital rules set by the occ based on its regulatory capital ratios at december 31 2015 schwab bank is considered well capitalized

fair value of financial instruments 

  

the company uses the market and income approaches to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value and to determine fair value disclosures see “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – 2 summary of significant accounting policies and 17 fair values of assets and liabilities” for more information on the company’s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 

  

when available the company uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities when utilizing market data with a bidask spread the company uses the price within the bidask spread that best represents fair value when quoted prices do not exist the company uses prices obtained from independent thirdparty pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets the company generally obtains prices from at least three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value the company’s primary independent pricing service provides prices based on observable trades and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads and weightedaverage maturity for the same or similar “tobeissued” securities the company compares the prices obtained from its primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable the company does not adjust the prices received from independent thirdparty pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts at december 31 2015 and 2014  the company did not adjust prices received from the primary independent thirdparty pricing service

critical accounting estimates 

  

the consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us while the majority of the company’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are not based on estimates  there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the c ompany’s financial position and reported financial results these critical accounting estimates are described below  management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the company’s financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy 

  

otherthantemporary impairment of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity 

  

management evaluates whether securities available for sale and securities held to maturity are other thantemporarily impaired on a quarterly basis debt securities with unrealized losses are considered otti if the company intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such security before any anticipated recovery if management determines that a security is otti under these circumstances the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between the amortized cost and the thencurrent fair value 

  

a security is also otti if management does not expect to recover the amortized cost of the security in this circumstance t he impairment recognized in earnings represents the estimated credit loss and is measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security management utilizes cash flow models to estimate the expected future cash flow from the securities and to estimate the credit loss expected cash flows are discounted using the secu rity’s effective interest rate 

  

the evaluation of whether the company expects to recover the amortized cost of a security is inherently judgmental the evaluation includes the consideration of multiple factors including the magnitude and duration of the unrealized loss the financial condition of the issuer the payment structure of the security external credit ratings for assetbacked securities the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security to absorb credit losses on the underlying collateral recent events specific to the issuer and the issuer’s industry and whether the company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments 

  

valuation of goodwill 

  

the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever indications of impairment exist impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value resulting in an impairment charge for this excess adverse changes in the company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition a loss of key personnel the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the company’s recorded goodwill 

  

the company’s annual goodwill impairment testing date is april 1 st  in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on april 1 2015  management performed an assessment of each of the company’s reporting units generally defined as the company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management and concluded that goodwill was not impaired 

  

allowance for loan losses 

  

the appropriateness of the allowance is reviewed quarterly by management taking into consideration current economic conditions the existing loan portfolio composition past loss experience and risks inherent in the portfolio s  

  

the methodology to establish an allowance for loan losses related to the first mortgage and heloc portfolios utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments defaults and probable losses for the loan segments based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the segments the methodology considers the effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including but not limited to interest rates housing price movements as measured by a housing price index economic

conditions estimated defaults and foreclosures measured by historical and expected delinquencies changes in prepayment speeds ltv ratios past loss experience estimates of future loss severities borrower credit risk measured by fico scores and the adequacy of collateral the methodology also evaluates concentrations in the loan segments including loan products year of origination and geographical distribution of collateral 

  

probable losses are forecast using a loanlevel simulation of the delinquency status of the loans over the term of the loans the simulation starts with the current relevant risk indicators including the current delinquent status of each loan the estimated current ltv ratio of each loan the term and structure of each loan current key interest rates including us treasury and   libor rates and borrower fico scores the more significant variables in the simulation include delinquency roll rates loss severity housing prices and interest rates delinquency roll rates are estimated from the company’s historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information further the delinquency roll rates within the loanlevel simulation discussed above are calibrated to match a moving average of the delinquency roll rates actually experienced in the respective first mortgage and heloc portfolios loss severity estimates are based on the company’s historical loss experience and market trends the estimated loss severity ie  loss given default used in the allowance for loan loss for helocs is higher than that used for first mortgages housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values factors affecting the home price index include housing inventory unemployment interest rates and inflation expectations interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths this methodology results in loss factors that are applied to the outstanding balances to determine the allowance for l oan loss for each loan segment 

  

legal and regulatory reserves 

  

reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter after considering among other factors the progress of the case prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases available defenses insurance coverage and indemnification and the opinions and views of legal counsel in many cases including most class action lawsuits it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred or to estimate the range of that loss until the matter is close to resolution in which case no accrual is made until that time reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved 

  

the company’s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee additionally management has reviewed with the audit committee the company’s significant estimates discussed in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

  

market risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by the company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equi ty prices or market conditions 

  

the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on its interestearning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources that finance these assets   the majority of the company’s interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities are sensitive to changes in shortterm interest rates to a lesser degree the company is sensitive to changes in longterm interest rates through some of its investment portfolios to manage the company’s market risk related to interest rates management utilizes simulation models which include the net interest revenue sensitivity analysis described below 

  

net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets primarily include investment securities margin loans and bank loans these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment  because the company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on margin loans and bank loans and controls the composition of its investment securities it has some ability to manage its net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions 

  

to mitigate the risk of loss the company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interestearning assets and funding sources to remain within these guidelines the company manages the maturity repricing and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios 

  

the company is also subject to market risk as a result of fluctuations in option and equity prices the company’s direct holdings of option and equity securities and its associated exposure to option and equity prices are not material the company is indirectly exposed to option futures and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts securities collateralizing ma rgin loans to brokerage client s and c lient securities loaned out as part of the company’s securities lending activities equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity margin borrowing and overall client engagement with the company additionally the company earns mutual fund service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the company 

  

financial instruments held by the company are also subject to liquidity risk – that is the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument current conditions in the credit markets have reduced market liquidity among a range of financial instruments including the types of instruments held by the company and fair value can differ significantly from the value implied by the credit quality and actual performance of the instrument’s underlying cash flows 

  

the company’s market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material 

  

net interest revenue simulation 

  

for the company’s net interest revenue sensitivity analysis the company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulation includes all interestsensitive assets and liabilities key variables in the simulation include the repricing of financial instruments prepayment reinvestment and product pricing assumptions the company uses constant balances and market rates in the simulation assumptions in order to minimize the number of variables and to better isolate risks the simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and as a result cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing 

 52  

 

the charles schwab corporation 

magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies including changes in asset and liability mix 

  

if the company’s guidelines for its net interest revenue sensitivity are breached management must report the breach to the company’s corporate assetliability management and pricing committee and establish a plan to address the interest rate risk this plan could include but is not limited to rebalancing certain investment portfolios or using derivative instruments to mitigate the interest rate risk depending on the severity and expected duration of the breach as well as the then current interest rate environment the plan could also be to take no action any plan that recommends taking action is required to be approved by the company’s corporate assetliability management and pricing committee  there were   no breaches of the company’s net interest revenue sensitivity guidelines during the years ended december 31 2015 or 2014    

  

as represented by the simulations presented below the company’s investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall 

  

t he simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as the company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood the company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the simulated net interest revenue change over the next 12 months beginning december 31 2015 and 2014 of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period 

  



  

the sensitivities shown in the simulation reflect the fact that shortterm interest rates in 2015 remained at low levels despite the increase in federal funds target range to 25 to 50 as directed by the federal open markets committee in december 2015 the current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources a decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the company’s investment portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense further compressing net interest margin any increases in shortterm interest rates result in a greater impact as yields on interestearning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources

risk factors 

tableend

  

the company faces a variety of risks that may affect its operations or financial results and many of those risks are driven by factors that the company cannot control or predict the following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant although there may be other risks that could arise or may prove to be more significant than expected that may affect the company’s operations or financial results 

  

for a discussion of the company’s risk management including operational risk credit risk market risk  liquidity risk compliance risk and legal risk  see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – risk management” 

  

developments in the business economic and geopolitical environment could negatively impact the company’s business 

  

the company’s business can be adversely affected by the general environment – economic corporate securities market regulatory and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations trading activity interest rates and overall investor engagement and are outside of the company’s control deterioration in the housing and credit markets reductions in shortterm interest rates and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact the company’s results of operations and capital resources 

  

extensive regulation of the company’s businesses limits the company’s activities and may subject it to significant penalties 

  

as a participant in the securities banking and financial services industries the company is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws by governmental agencies supervisory authorities and sros such regulation continues to grow more extensive and complex  and regulatory proceedings continue to become more frequent and sanctions more severe  the requirements imposed by the company’s regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets the safety and soundness of financial institutions and the protection of clients these regulations often serve to limit the company’s activities by way of capital customer protection and market conduct requirements and restrictions on the business activities that the company may conduct 

  

in addition to specific banking laws and regulations the company’s banking regulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies and could require csc andor schwab bank to hold more capital increase liquidity or limit their ability to pay dividends or csc’s ability to repurchase shares the banking regulators could also limit the company’s ability to grow including adding assets launching new products and undertaking strategic investments 

  

despite the company’s efforts to comply with applicable regulations there are a number of risks particularly in areas where applicable regulations may be unclear or where regulators revise their previous guidance any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by the company’s regulators against the company or its affiliates officers or employees could result in fines penalties cease and desist orders enforcement actions suspension or expulsion or other disciplinary sanctions

the charles schwab corporation 

including limitations on the company’s business activities any of which could harm the company’s reputation and adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

while the company maintains systems and procedures designed to ensure that it complies with ap plicable laws and regulations violations could occur in addition  some legalregulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time  there may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance including restrictions on certain activities such a finding may also damage the company’s reputation and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in the company’s securities 

  

legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively impact the company’s business and financial results 

  

new legislation rule changes or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal state and sro rules and regulations including changes relating to money market mutual funds and brokerdealer fiduciary duties may directly affect the operation and profitability of the company or its specific business lines the profitability of the company could also be affected by rules and regulations which impact the business and financial communities generally including changes to the laws governing taxation electronic commerce client privacy and security of client data in addition the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business the company conducts modifications to the company’s business practices increased capital requirements or additional costs 

  

financial reforms and related regulations may affect the company’s business activities financial position and profitability 

  

there have been extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms as a result of the enactment of the “doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act” the doddfrank act  among other changes 









  

implementation of the legislation is ongoing and significant rulemaking and interpretations remain to be completed for example rules relating to a minimum net stable funding ratio   which will require financial institutions to have a stable funding structure over a oneyear horizon have not yet been proposed in addition the legislation mandates multiple studies which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action csc will continue to review the impact that proposed rulemaking will have on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations as such rulemaking is issued 

  

the legislation gives the sec discretion to adopt rules regarding standards of conduct for brokerdealers providing investment advice to retail customers the various studies required by the legislation could result in additional rulemaking or legislative action which could impact the company’s business and financial results 

  

the changes resulting from the legislation may impact the profitability of the company’s business activities require changes to certain of its business practices impose upon the company more stringent capital liquidity and leverage ratio 

 8  

 

the charles schwab corporation 

requirements or otherwise adversely affect the company’s business these changes may also require the company to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes 

  

technology and operational failures or errors could subject the company to losses litigation and regulatory actions 

  

the company faces operational risk which is the potential for loss due to inadequate or failed internal processes systems and firms or exchanges handling client orders or from external events and relationships impacting the company andor any of its key business partners and vendors this risk also includes the risk of human error execution errors errors in models such as those used for asset management capital management risk management and compliance employee misconduct unauthorized trading external fraud computer viruses distributed denial of service attacks terrorist attacks natural disaster power outage capacity constraints  software flaws and similar events  for example the company and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have in certain circumstances made websites mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time it could take several hours or more to restore full functionality to the company’s technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen event which could affect the company’s ability to process and settle client transactions moreover instances of fraud or other misconduct including improper use or disclosure of confidential client employee or company information might also negatively impact the company’s reputation and client confidence in the company in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances despite the company’s efforts to identify areas of risk oversee operational areas involving risk and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer unexpected losses reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors including those of its vendors or other third parties 

  

while the company devotes substantial attention and resources to the reliability capacity and scalability of its systems extraordinary trading volumes could cause the company’s computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail affecting the company’s ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients’ orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses and decreased client satisfaction the company is also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges clearing houses and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement systems failures and constraints and transaction error at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices cause substantial losses for the company and for its clients and subject the company to claims from its clients for damages 

  

a significant decrease in the   company’s liquidity could negatively affect the company’s business and financial management as well as reduce client confidence in the company 

  

maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to the business operations of the company including margin lending mortgage lending and transaction settlement among other liquidity needs the company meets its liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by client activity and operating earnings as well as cash provided by external financing fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances as well as changes in market conditions may affect the company’s ability to meet its liquidity needs a reduction in the company’s liquidity position could reduce client confidence in the company which could result in the loss of client accounts in addition if the company’s brokerdealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to csc which could reduce csc’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt and pay cash dividends in addition csc may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries 

  

factors which may adversely affect the company’s liquidity position include a reduction in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts a dramatic increase in the company’s client lending activities including margin  mortgagerelated and personal lending unanticipated outflows of company cash increased capital requirements other regulatory changes or a loss of market or customer confidence in the company schwab may also experience temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between clients’ transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances 

  

when cash generated by client activity and operating earnings is not sufficient for the company’s liquidity needs the company must seek external financing during periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets potential sources of external financing could be reduced and borrowing costs could increase although csc and schwab maintain committed and uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines and csc has a commercial paper issuance program as well as a universal 

 9  

 

the charles schwab corporation 

shelf registration statement filed with the sec financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets in addition a significant downgrade in the company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets 

  

the company may suffer significant losses from its credit exposures 

  

the company’s businesses are subject to the risk that a client counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate while the company has policies and procedures designed to manage this risk the policies and procedures may not be fully effective the company’s exposure mainly results from margin lending clients’ options trading securities lending mortgage lending its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds that the company sponsors 

  

when clients purchase securities on margin or trade options or futures  the company is subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients’ indebtedness abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses 

  

the company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale and securities held to maturity portfolios which include   us agency and nonagency mortgagebacked securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities us agency notes certificates of deposit and commercial paper among other investments these instruments are also subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial market’s assessment of issuer credit quality increases in the unemployment rate delinquency and default rates housing price declines changes in prevailing interest rates and other economic factors a failure to raise the us debt limit andor a downgrade of the us government’s credit rating could decrease the value of the company’s securities in both the available for sale and held to maturity portfolios 

  

loss of value of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such securities are other than temporarily impaired the evaluation of whether otherthantemporary impairment exists is a matter of judgment which includes the assessment of several factors see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting estimates” if management determines that a security is otherthantemporarily impaired the cost basis of the security may be adjusted and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings certain securities available for sale experienced continued credit deterioration in 2014  which resulted in impairment charges deterioration in the performance of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity could result in the recognition of future impairment charges 

  

the company’s loans to banking clients primarily consist of first mortgages and helocs increases in delinquency and default rates housing price declines increases in the unemployment rate and other economic factors can result in charges for loan loss reserves and write downs on such loans 

  

heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments concentration risk can increase the company’s risk of loss examples of the company’s credit concentration risk include 







  

the company may also be subject to concentration risk when lending to a particular counterparty borrower or issuer 

  

the company sponsors a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds although the company has no obligation to do so the company may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit liquidity or other support to its funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity such support could cause the company to take significant charges could reduce the company’s liquidity and in certain situations could with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds result in the company having to consolidate a supported fund in its financial statements if the company chose not to 

 10  

 

the charles schwab corporation 

provide credit liquidity or other support in such a situation the company could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected 

  

significant interest rate changes could affect the company’s profitability and financial condition 

  

the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interestearning assets such as cash equivalents short and longterm investments and mortgage and margin loans relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources including deposits in banking and   uninvested cash in brokerage accounts shortterm borrowings and longterm debt changes in interest rates generally affect the interest earned on interestearning assets differently than the interest the company pays on its interestbearing liabilities in addition certain funding sources do not bear interest and their cost therefore does not vary overall the company is positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment the company could be adversely affected by a decline in interest rates if the rates that the company earns on interestearning assets decline more than the rates that the company pays on its funding sources or if prepayment rates increase on the mortgages and mortgagebacked securities that the company holds the company may also be limited in the amount it can reduce interest rates on funding sources such as deposit accounts  and still offer a competitive return 

  

as a result of the low interest rate environment the company has been waiving and may continue to waive a portion of its management fees for certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds to the extent the overall yield on certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds falls to a level at or below the management fees on those funds the company may waive a portion of its fee in order to continue providing some return to clients such fee waivers negatively impact the company’s asset management and administration fees 

  

the company is subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending itself against claims or proceedings 

  

the financial services industry faces substantial litigation and regulatory risks the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business including arbitrations class actions and other litigation some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages the company is also the subject of inquiries investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies 

  

litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by the company’s clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied at the company claims from clients of third party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors’ misconduct litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights eg patents such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources if the company were found to have infringed a thirdparty patent or other intellectual property rights it could incur substantial damages and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology or providing certain products or services 

  

actions brought against the company may result in settlements awards injunctions fines penalties or other results adverse to the company including reputational harm even if the company is successful in defending against these actions the defense of such matters may result in the company incurring significant expenses predicting the outcome of matters is inherently difficult particularly where claims are brought on behalf of various classes of claimants claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages or when investigations or legal proceedings are at an early stage a substantial judgment settlement fine or penalty could be material to the company’s operating results or cash flows for a particular future period depending on the company’s results for that period in market downturns the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased see “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – 14 commitments and contingencies”

current market and regulatory environment and other developments 

  

to the extent shortterm interest rates remain at current low levels the company’s net interest revenue will continue to be constrained even as growth in average balances helps to increase such revenue the low shortterm interest rate environment also affects asset management and administration fees the company continues to waive a portion of its management fees    as the overall yields on certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds have remained at levels at or below the management fees on those funds  these and certain other schwabsponsored money market mutual funds may not be able to replace maturing securities with securities of equal or higher yields as a result the yields on such funds may remain around or decline from their current levels and therefore below the stated management fees on those funds to the extent this occurs asset management and administration fees may continue to be negatively affected

liquidity and capital resources 

  

csc conducts substantially all of its business through its whollyowned subsidiaries the company’s capital structure is designed to provide each subsidiary with capital and liquidity to meet its operational needs and regulatory requirements 

  

csc is a savings and loan holding company and schwab bank csc’s depository institution is a federal savings bank csc is subject to supervision and regulation by the federal reserve and schwab bank is subject to supervision and regulation by the occ 

  

liquidity 

  

csc 

  

csc’s liquidity needs arise from funding its subsidiaries’ operations including margin and mortgage lending and transaction settlement in addition to funding cash dividends acquisitions investments short and longterm debt and managing statutory capital requirements 

  

csc’s liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries as well as cash provided by external financing csc has a universal automatic shelf registration statement shelf registration statement on file with the sec which enables csc to issue debt equity  and other securities csc maintains excess liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and shortterm investments to cover daily funding needs and to support growth in the company’s business generally csc does not hold liquidity at its subsidiaries in excess of amounts deemed sufficient to support the subsidiaries’ operations including any regulatory capital requirements schwab schwab bank and optionsxpress inc are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with csc as further discussed below management believes that funds generated by the operations of csc’s subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting csc’s liquidity needs providing adequate liquidity to meet schwab bank’s capital guidelines and maintaining schwab and optionsxpress inc’s net capital 

  

on july 25 2013 csc issued 275 million of senior notes that mature in 2018 under its shelf registration statement the senior notes have a fixed interest rate of 220 with interest payable semiannually 

  

csc is required to serve as a source of strength for schwab bank and must have the ability to provide financial assistance if schwab bank experiences financial distress to manage capital adequacy the company currently utilizes a target tier 1 leverage ratio for csc  as currently defined by the federal reserve of at least 6 at december 31 2014  csc’s tier 1 leverage ratio was 69  tier 1 capital ratio was 180  and total capital ratio was 181  prior to january 1 2015 csc as a savings and loan holding company was not subject to specific statutory capital requirements beginning on january 1 2015 csc is subject to new capital requirements set by the federal reserve 

  

the following are details of csc’s longterm debt 

  



  

csc has authorization from its board of directors to issue unsecured commercial paper notes commercial paper notes not to exceed 15 billion management has set a current limit for the commercial paper program of 800 million the maturities of the commercial paper notes may vary but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue the commercial paper is not redeemable prior to maturity and cannot be voluntarily prepaid the proceeds of the commercial paper program are to be used for general corporate purposes there were no borrowings of commercial paper notes outstanding at december 31 2014 csc’s ratings for these shortterm borrowings are p1 by moody’s a1 by standard  poor’s and f1 by fitch

csc maintains an 800 million committed unsecured credit facility with a group of 12 banks which is scheduled to expire in june 2015  this facility replaced a simila r facility that expired in june 2014 and both facilities were unused during   2014  the funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes the financial covenants under this facility require schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio as defined schwab bank to be well capitalized as defined and csc to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity  excluding accumulated other comprehensive income  at december 31 2014  the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was  78 billion csc’s stockholders’ equity  excluding accumulated other comprehensive income at december 31 2014  was  116 billion management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on csc’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements 

  

csc also has direct access to certain of the uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines discussed below that are primarily utilized by schwab to manage shortterm liquidity these lines were not used by csc during 2014  

  

in addition schwab provided csc with a 10 billion credit facility  which was scheduled to expire in december 2014 schwab terminated this credit facility in july 2014  

  

schwab 

  

schwab’s liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts which were  320 billion and  332 billion at december 31 2014 and 2013  respectively management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for schwab 

  

schwab is subject to regulatory requirements of rule 15c31 under the securities exchange act of 1934 the uniform net capital rule that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of brokerdealers these regulations prohibit schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings from csc paying cash dividends or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5 of aggregate debit balances or less than 120 of its minimum dollar requirement of  250000  at december 31 2014  schwab’s net capital was  16 billion  10  of aggregate debit balances which was  12 billion in excess of its minimum required net capital and  739 million in excess of 5 of aggregate debit balances 

  

schwab is also subject to rule 15c33 under the securities exchange act of 1934 and other applicable regulations that require it to maintain cash or qualified securities in a segregated reserve account for the exclusive benefit of clients these funds are included in cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes in the company’s consolidated balance sheets and are not available as a general source of liquidity 

  

most of schwab’s assets are readily convertible to cash consisting primarily of shortterm investmentgrade interestearning investments the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements receivables from brokerage clients and receivables from brokers dealers and clearing organizations client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities receivables from and payables to brokers dealers and clearing organizations primarily represent current open transactions which usually settle or can be closed out within a few business days 

  

schwab has a finance lease obligation related to an office building and land under a 20year lease the remaining finance lease obligation of  83 million at december 31 2014  is being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term of ten years 

  

to manage shortterm liquidity schwab maintains uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines with a group of banks the need for shortterm borrowings arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements scheduled liquidation of interestearnings investments and movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements schwab used such borrowings for three days in 2014  with average daily amounts borrowed of  25 million there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at december 31 2014

capital resources 

  

the company’s cash position reported as cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated balance sheets and cash flows are affected by changes in brokerage client cash balances and the associated amounts required to be segregated under regulatory guidelines timing differences between cash and investments actually segregated on a given date and the amount required to be segregated for that date may arise in the ordinary course of business  and are addressed by the company in accordance with applicable regulations other factors which affect the company’s cash position and cash flows include investment activity in security portfolios levels of capital expenditures acquisition and divestiture activity banking client deposit activity brokerage and banking client loan activity financing activity in longterm debt payments of dividends and repurchases and issuances of csc’s preferred and common stock the combination of these factors can cause significant fluctuations in the cash position during specific time periods

fair value of financial instruments 

  

the company uses the market and income approaches to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value and to determine fair value disclosures see “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – 2 summary of significant accounting policies and 16 fair values of assets and liabilities” for more information on the company’s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value

critical accounting estimates 

  

the consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us while the majority of the company’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are not based on estimates  there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the c ompany’s financial position and reported financial results these critical accounting estimates are described below  management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the company’s financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy 

  

otherthantemporary impairment of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity 

  

management evaluates whether securities available for sale and securities held to maturity are otherthantemporarily impaired otti on a quarterly basis debt securities with unrealized losses are considered otti if the company intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such security before any anticipated recovery if management determines that a security is otti under these circumstances the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between the amortized cost and the thencurrent fair value 

  

a security is also otti if management does not expect to recover the amortized cost of the security in this circumstance t he impairment recognized in earnings represents estimated credit loss and is measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security management utilizes cash flow models to estimate the expected future cash flow from the securities and to estimate the credit loss expected cash flows are discounted using the security’s effective interest rate

the charles schwab corporation 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted 

the evaluation of whether the company expects to recover the amortized cost of a security is inherently judgmental the evaluation includes the assessment of several bond performance indicators including the portion of the underlying loans that are delinquent 30 days 60 days 90 days in bankruptcy in foreclosure or converted to real estate owned the actual amount of loss incurred on the underlying loans in which the property has been foreclosed and sold the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security available to absorb credit losses on the underlying loans the current price and magnitude of the unrealized loss and whether the company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments management uses cash flow models to further assess the likelihood of otherthantemporary impairment for the company’s nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities to develop the cash flow models the company uses forecasted loss severity prepayment speeds ie the rate at which the principal on underlying loans are paid down and default rates over the securities’ expected remaining maturities 

  

valuation of goodwill 

  

the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever indications of impairment exist impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value resulting in an impairment charge for this excess adverse changes in the company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition a loss of key personnel the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the company’s recorded goodwill 

  

the company’s annual goodwill impairment testing date is april 1 st  in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on april 1 2014  management performed an assessment of each of the company’s reporting units generally defined as the company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management and concluded that goodwill was not impaired 

  

allowance for loan losses 

  

the appropriateness of the allowance is reviewed quarterly by management taking into consideration current economic conditions the existing loan portfolio composition past loss experience and risks inherent in the portfolio 

  

the methodology to establish an allowance for loan losses related to the first mortgage and heloc portfolio utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments defaults and probable losses for the loan segments based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the segments the methodology considers the effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including but not limited to interest rates housing price movements as measured by a housing price index economic conditions estimated defaults and foreclosures measured by historical and expected delinquencies changes in prepayment speeds ltv ratios past loss experience estimates of future loss severities borrower credit risk measured by fico scores and the adequacy of collateral the methodology also evaluates concentrations in the loan segments including loan products year of origination and geographical distribution of collateral 

  

probable losses are forecast using a loanlevel simulation of the delinquency status of the loans over the term of the loans the simulation starts with the current relevant risk indicators including the current delinquent status of each loan the estimated current ltv ratio of each loan the term and structure of each loan current key interest rates including us treasury and london interbank offered rate libor rates and borrower fico scores the more significant variables in the simulation include delinquency roll rates loss severity housing prices and interest rates delinquency roll rates ie the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result in a loss are estimated from the company’s historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information further the delinquency roll rates within the loanlevel simulation discussed above are calibrated to match a moving average of the delinquency roll rates actually experienced in the respective first mortgage and heloc portfolios loss severity estimates are based on the company’s historical loss experience and market trends the estimated loss severity ie loss given default used in the allowance for loan loss methodology for helocs is higher than that used in the methodology for first mortgages housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values factors affecting the home price index include housing inventory unemployment interest rates and inflation expectations interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths as a result the current state of house prices and the current state of delinquencies unique to the company’s first mortgage and

heloc portfolios are considered in the allowance for loan loss methodology   this methodology results in loss factors that are applied to the outstanding balances to determine the allowance for loan loss for each loan segment 

  

the allowance for personal loans secured by securities is established on a loan by loan basis the market value of collateral pledged by borrowers is regularly reviewed to ensure the company’s commitment to extend credit is overcollateralized if collateral is in danger of falling below specified levels the company may reduce a borrower’s committed line or may liquidate collateral at december 31 2014 and 2013 the allowance for loan losses related to personal loans secured by securities was immaterial 

  

legal and regulatory reserves 

  

reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter after considering among other factors the progress of the case prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases available defenses insurance coverage and indemnification and the opinions and views of legal counsel in many cases including most class action lawsuits it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred or to estimate the range of that loss until the matter is close to resolution in which case no accrual is made until that time reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved 

  

the company’s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee additionally management has reviewed with the audit committee the company’s significant estimates discussed in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

tableend

  

market risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by the company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or market conditions 

  

the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on its interestearning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources that finance these assets   the majority of the company’s interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities are sensitive to changes in shortterm interest rates to a lesser degree the company is sensitive to changes in longterm interest rates through some of its investment portfolios to manage the company’s market risk related to interest rates management utilizes simulation models which include the net interest revenue sensitivity analysis described below 

  

net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets include residential real estate loans and mortgagebacked securities these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and to changes to prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment  because the company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients and the rates charged on margin loans and loans to banking clients and controls the composition of its investment securities it has some ability to manage its net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions 

  

to mitigate the risk of loss the company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interestearning assets and funding sources to remain within these guidelines the company manages the maturity repricing and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios 

  

the company is also subject to market risk as a result of fluctuations in option and equity prices the company’s direct holdings of option and equity securities and its associated exposure to option and equity prices are not material the company is indirectly exposed to option  futures and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers and customer securities loaned out as part of the company’s securities lending activities equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity margin borrowing and overall client engagement with the company additionally the company earns mutual fund service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the company 

  

financial instruments held by the company are also subject to liquidity risk – that is the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument current conditions in the credit markets have significantly reduced market liquidity in a wide range of financial instruments including the types of instruments held by the company and fair value can differ significantly from the value implied by the credit quality and actual performance of the instrument’s underlying cash flows 

  

for discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – current market and regulatory environment and other developments” 

  

the company’s market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material 

  

net interest revenue simulation 

  

for the company’s net interest revenue sensitivity analysis the company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulation includes all interestsensitive assets and liabilities key variables in the simulation include the repricing of financial instruments prepayment reinvestment and

the charles schwab corporation 

product pricing assumptions the company uses constant balances and market rates in the simulation assumptions in order to minimize the number of variables and to better isolate risks the simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and as a result cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies including changes in asset and liability mix 

  

if the company’s guidelines for its net interest revenue sensitivity are breached management must report the breach to the company’s corporate assetliability management and pricing committee corporate alco and establish a plan to address the interest rate risk this plan could include but is not limited to rebalancing certain investment portfolios or using derivative instruments to mitigate the interest rate risk depending on the severity and expected duration of the breach as well as the then current interest rate environment the plan could also be to take no action any plan that recommends taking action is required to be approved by the company’s corporate alco there were   no breaches of the company’s net interest revenue sensitivity guidelines during the years ended december 31 2014 or 2013    

  

as represented by the simulations presented below the company’s investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall 

  

t he simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as the company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood the company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the results of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to the company’s current market rates forecast on simulated net interest revenue over the next 12 months beginning december 31 2014 and 2013  

  



  

the sensitivities shown in the simulation reflect the fact that shortterm interest rates in 2014 remained at historically low levels including the federal funds target rate which was unchanged at a range of zero to 025   the current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources a decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the company’s investment portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense further compressing net interest margin any increases in shortterm interest rates result in a greater impact as yields on interestearning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources

the company maintains systems and procedures designed to ensure that it complies with ap plicable laws and regulations however some legalregulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there was in place at the time systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations there may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance including restrictions on certain activities such a finding may also damage the company’s reputation and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in the company’s securities 

  

legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively impact the company’s business and financial results 

  

new legislation rule changes or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal state and sro rules and regulations including changes relating to money market mutual funds brokerdealer fiduciary duties and mortgage products and services may directly affect the operation and profitability of the company or its specific business lines the profitability 

 

the charles schwab corporation 

of the company could also be affected by rules and regulations which impact the business and financial communities generally including changes to the laws governing taxation electronic commerce client privacy and security of client data in addition the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business the company conducts modifications to the company’s business practices increased capital requirements or additional costs 

  

financial reforms and related regulations may affect the company’s business activities financial position and profitability 

  

the doddfrank act was signed into law in july 2010 and implementation is ongoing this legislation makes extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and significant rulemaking and interpretation remains in addition the legislation mandates multiple studies which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action among other things the legislation authorizes various assessments and fees and requires the establishment of minimum leverage and riskbased capital requirements for insured depository institutions and requires the sec to complete studies and develop rules regarding various investor protection issues the legislation also charges the federal reserve with drafting enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” csc has not been designated as “systemically important” but could be designated in the future the legislation also eliminated the office of thrift supervision ots effective july 21 2011 and as a result the federal reserve became csc’s primary regulator and the occ became the primary regulator of schwab bank csc will   continue to review the impact that   proposed rulemaking will have on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations  as such rulemaking is issued  

  

in july 2013 the us banking agencies issued regulatory capital rules that implement basel iii and relevant provisions of the doddfrank act which are applicable to savings and loan holding companies such as csc and federal savings banks such as schwab bank the rules which will be phased in beginning on january 1 2015 will subject csc to consolidated capital requirements the rules also establish more restrictive capital definitions higher riskweightings for certain asset classes higher minimum capital ratios and capital buffers failure to meet the minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have a negative impact on the company 

  

in october 2013 the federal reserve in collaboration with the occ and the federal deposit insurance corporation issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking that would implement a quantitative liquidity requirement generally consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio lcr standard established by basel iii the lcr would apply to all internationally active banking organizations the federal reserve also proposed a modified lcr standard which would apply to the company under the modified lcr a depository institution holding company would be required to maintain highquality liquid assets in an amount related to its total net cash outflows over a prospective period the proposed transition period for the rule woul d begin on january 1 2015 and institutions would be required t o be fully compliant by january 1 2017 the company is currently evaluating the impact of the proposed rule which may be subject to further modification 

  

the legislation also established a new independent consumer financial protection bureau cfpb  which has broad rulemaking supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer products including mortgages homeequity loans and credit cards states will be permitted to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and state attorney generals can enforce consumer protection rules issued by the cfpb  these rules may negatively impact the range of products offered and profitability of our loan products 

  

the legislation gives the sec discretion to adopt rules regarding standards of conduct for brokerdealers providing investment advice to retail customers the various studies required by the legislation could result in additional rulemaking or legislative action which could impact the company’s business and financial results 

  

the changes resulting from the legislation may impact the profitability of the company’s business activities require changes to certain of its business practices impose upon the company more stringent capital liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect the company’s business these changes may also require the company to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes 

  

 

the charles schwab corporation 

technology and operational failures or errors could subject the company to losses litigation and regulatory actions 

  

the company faces operational risk which is the potential for loss due to inadequate or failed internal processes systems and firms or exchanges handling client orders or from external events and relationships impacting the company andor any of its key business partners and vendors this risk also includes the risk of human error execution errors employee misconduct unauthorized trading external fraud computer viruses distributed denial of service attacks terrorist attacks natural disaster power outage capacity constraints  software flaws and similar events  for example the company and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have in certain circumstances made websites mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time it could take several hours or more to restore full functionality to the company’s technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen event which could affect the company’s ability to process and settle client transactions moreover instances of fraud or other misconduct including improper use or disclosure of confidential client employee or company information might also negatively impact the company’s reputation and client confidence in the company in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances despite the company’s efforts to identify areas of risk oversee operational areas involving risk and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer unexpected losses reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors including those of its vendors or other third parties 

  

while the company devotes substantial attention and resources to the reliability capacity and scalability of its systems extraordinary trading volumes could cause the company’s computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail affecting the company’s ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients’ orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses and decreased client satisfaction the company is also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges clearing houses and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement systems failures and constraints and transaction error at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices cause substantial losses for the company and for its clients and subject the company to claims from its clients for damages 

  

a significant decrease in the   company’s liquidity could negatively affect the company’s business and financial management as well as reduce client confidence in the company 

  

maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to the business operations of the company including margin lending mortgage lending and transaction settlement among other liquidity needs the company meets its liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by client activity and operating earnings as well as cash provided by external financing fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances as well as changes in market conditions may affect the company’s ability to meet its liquidity needs a reduction in the company’s liquidity position could reduce client confidence in the company which could result in the loss of client accounts in addition if the company’s brokerdealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to csc which could reduce csc’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt and pay cash dividends in addition csc may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries 

  

factors which may adversely affect the company’s liquidity position include a reduction in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts a dramatic increase in the company’s client lending activities including margin  mortgagerelated and personal lending unanticipated outflows of company cash increased capital requirements other regulatory changes or a loss of market or customer confidence in the company schwab may also experience temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between clients’ transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances 

  

when cash generated by client activity and operating earnings is not sufficient for the company’s liquidity needs the company must seek external financing during periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets potential sources of external financing could be reduced and borrowing costs could increase although csc and schwab maintain committed and uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines and csc has a commercial paper issuance program as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets in addition a significant downgrade in the company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets 

  

 

the charles schwab corporation 

the company may suffer significant losses from its credit exposures 

  

the company’s businesses are subject to the risk that a client counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate while the company has policies and procedures designed to manage this risk the policies and procedures may not be fully effective the company’s exposure mainly results from margin lending clients’ options trading securities lending mortgage lending its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds that the company sponsors 

  

when clients purchase securities on margin or trade options  the company is subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients’ indebtedness abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses 

  

the company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale and securities held to maturity portfolios which include   us agency and nonagency mortgagebacked securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities us agency notes certificates of deposit and commercial paper among other investments these instruments are also subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial market’s assessment of issuer credit quality increases in the unemployment rate delinquency and default rates housing price declines changes in prevailing interest rates and other economic factors a failure to raise the us debt limit andor a downgrade of the us government’s credit rating could decrease the value of the company’s securities in both the available for sale and held to maturity portfolios 

  

loss of value of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such securities are other than temporarily impaired the evaluation of whether otherthantemporary impairment exists is a matter of judgment which includes the assessment of several factors see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting estimates” if management determines that a security is otherthantemporarily impaired the cost basis of the security may be adjusted and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings certain securities available for sale experienced continued credit deterioration in 2013  which resulted in impairment charges deterioration in the performance of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity could result in the recognition of future impairment charges 

  

the company’s loans to banking clients primarily consist of first mortgages and helocs increases in delinquency and default rates housing price declines increases in the unemployment rate and other economic factors can result in charges for loan loss reserves and write downs on such loans 

  

heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments concentration risk can increase the company’s risk of loss examples of the company’s credit concentration risk include 







  

the company may also be subject to concentration risk when lending to a particular counterparty borrower or issuer 

  

the company sponsors a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds although the company has no obligation to do so the company may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit liquidity or other support to its funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity such support could cause the company to take significant charges could reduce the company’s liquidity and in certain situations could with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds result in the company having to consolidate a supported fund in its financial statements if the company chose not to provide credit liquidity or other support in such a situation the company could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected 

  

 

the charles schwab corporation 

significant interest rate changes could affect the company’s profitability and financial condition 

  

the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interestearning assets such as cash equivalents short and longterm investments and mortgage and margin loans relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources including deposits in banking and   uninvested cash in brokerage accounts shortterm borrowings and longterm debt changes in interest rates generally affect the interest earned on interestearning assets differently than the interest the company pays on its interestbearing liabilities in addition certain funding sources do not bear interest and their cost therefore does not vary overall the company is positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment the company could be adversely affected by a decline in interest rates if the rates that the company earns on interestearning assets decline more than the rates that the company pays on its funding sources or if prepayment rates increase on the mortgages and mortgagebacked securities that the company holds the company may also be limited in the amount it can reduce interest rates on funding sources such as deposit accounts  and still offer a competitive return 

  

as a result of the low interest rate environment the company has been waiving and may continue to waive a portion of its management fees for certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds to the extent the overall yield on certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds falls to a level at or below the management fees on those funds the company may waive a portion of its fee in order to continue providing some return to clients such fee waivers negatively impact the company’s asset management and administration fees 

  

the company is subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending itself against claims or proceedings 

  

the financial services industry faces substantial litigation and regulatory risks the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business including arbitrations class actions and other litigation some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages the company is also the subject of inquiries investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies 

  

litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by the company’s clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied at the company claims from clients of third party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors’ misconduct litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights eg patents such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources if the company were found to have infringed a thirdparty patent or other intellectual property rights it could incur substantial damages and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology or providing certain products or services 

  

actions brought against the company may result in settlements awards injunctions fines penalties or other results adverse to the company including reputational harm even if the company is successful in defending against these actions the defense of such matters may result in the company incurring significant expenses predicting the outcome of matters is inherently difficult particularly where claims are brought on behalf of various classes of claimants claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages or when investigations or legal proceedings are at an early stage a substantial judgment settlement fine or penalty could be material to the company’s operating results or cash flows for a particular future period depending on the company’s results for that period in market downturns the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased see “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – 14 commitments and contingencies” 

  

the company relies on outsourced service providers to perform key functions 

  

the company relies on external service providers to perform certain key technology processing servicing and support functions these service providers face technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of the company’s confidential client employee or company information could cause the company to incur losses and could harm the company’s reputation an interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints financial difficulties or for any other reason and the company’s inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt the company’s 

 

the charles schwab corporation 

operations impact the company’s ability to offer certain products and services and result in financial losses to the company switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations 

  

security breaches of the company’s systems or those of its clients or third parties may subject the company to significant liability and damage the company’s reputation 

  

the company’s business involves the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential information about the company and its clients information security risks for financial institutions are increasing in part because of the use of the internet and mobile technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime activists hackers and other external parties the company’s systems and those of other financial institutions have been and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks malicious code computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access misuse loss or destruction of data including confidential customer information account takeovers unavailability of service or other events despite the company’s efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems the company may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means for example actions by a suborned employee 

  

security breaches including breaches of the company’s security measures or those of the company’s thirdparty service providers or clients could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject the company to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance actions by the company’s regulators damage to the company’s reputation or a loss of confidence in the company’s security measures which could harm the company’s business the company may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures 

  

the company also faces risk related to external fraud involving the compromise of clients’ personal electronic devices that can facilitate the unauthorized access to login and password information for their various online financial accounts including those at the company such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties  including foreign statesponsored parties  for example these parties send fraudulent “phishing” emails to the company’s clients in order to misappropriate user names passwords or other personal information losses reimbursed to clients under the company’s guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on the company’s financial position 

  

the company evaluates potential strategic transactions including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions any such transaction could have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows the process of evaluating negotiating and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert management’s attention from other business concerns and might cause the loss of key clients employees and business partners moreover integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties including the need to integrate operational financial and management information systems and management controls integrate relationships with clients and business partners and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas in addition an acquisition may cause the company to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings  further the company may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition and any future acquisition could be dilutive to the company’s current stockholders’ percentage ownership or to earnings per common share 

  

the company’s acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business operations or financial condition of the entity being acquired or sold to the extent the company enters into an agreement to buy or sell an entity there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected or at all if a material transaction does not close the company’s stock price could decline 

  

the company’s industry is characterized by aggressive price competition  

  

the company continually monitors its pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjusts trade commission rates interest rates on deposits and loans fees for advisory services and other fee structures to enhance its competitive position 

 

the charles schwab corporation 

increased price competition from other financial services firms such as reduced commissions to attract trading volume or higher deposit rates to attract client cash balances could impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

the industry in which the company competes has undergone a period of consolidation 

  

the company faces intense competition for the clients that it serves and the products and services it offers there has been significant consolidation as financial institutions with which the company competes have been acquired by or merged into or acquired other firms this consolidation may continue competition is based on many factors including the range of products and services offered pricing customer service brand recognition reputation and perceived financial strength consolidations may enable other firms to offer a broader range of products and services than the company does or offer such products at more competitive prices 

  

the company faces competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees especially for employees who are key to the company’s ability to build and enhance client relationships 

  

the market for quality professionals and other personnel in the company’s business is highly competitive competition is particularly strong for financial consultants who build and sustain the company’s client relationships the company’s ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon its ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs 

  

the company’s stock price has fluctuated historically and may continue to fluctuate 

  

the company’s stock price can be volatile among the factors that may affect the volatility of the company’s stock price are the following 







  

changes in the stock market generally or as it concerns the company’s industry as well as geopolitical economic and business factors unrelated to the company may also affect the company’s stock price 

  

future sales of csc’s equity securities may adversely affect the market price of csc’s common stock and result in dilution 

  

csc’s certificate of incorporation authorizes csc’s board of directors to among other things issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities without stockholder approval csc may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes the issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of csc’s common stock and may adversely affect the market price of csc’s common stock

core net new client assets is defined as net new client assets before significant onetime flows management considers this to be a useful metric when comparing periodtoperiod client asset flows the following onetime flows were excluded from core net new assets 







  

the company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees net interest revenue and trading revenue the company generates asset management and administration fees through its proprietary and thirdparty mutual fund offerings as well as feebased advisory solutions net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on funding sources asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue   are impacted by securities valuations interest rates the amount and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing funding sources the company’s ability to attract new clients and client activity levels the company generates trading revenue through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenue primarily from trading activity in client fixed income securities trading revenue is impacted by trading volumes the volatility of prices in the equity and fixed income markets and commission rates 

  

2013 compared to 2012

as a result of the company’s strong key client activity metrics the company achieved a pretax profit margin of 314  in 2013 overall net income increased by 15  in 2013 from 2012 and the return on average common stockholders’ equity was 11  in 2013 

  

along with the growth in its client base enrollments in client advisory solutions and stability in the economic environment helped the c ompany achieve increases in all three major revenue lines in 2013 compared to 2012  overall n e t revenues increased by 11  in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to increases in asset management and administration fees  net interest revenue  and trading revenue  partially offset by a decrease in other revenue – net asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to increases in mutual fund service fees and advice solutions fees  net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher balances of interestearning assets and higher interest rates on new fixedrate investments this increase was partially offset by the effect low er   average shortterm interest rates and the maturity of shortterm interestearning assets had on the company’s average net interest margin  trading revenue increased primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades and two additional trading days during the year other revenue – net decreased primarily due to a nonrecurring gain of 70 million relating to a confidential resolution of a vendor dispute in 2012  

  

expenses excluding interest increased by 9  in 2013   from   2012 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits professional services advertising and market development and other expense compensation and benefits expense increased

2012 compared to 2011 

  

valuations in the broad equity markets improved during 2012 compared to 2011  as the nasdaq composite index standard  poor’s 500 index and dow jones industrial average increased 16 13 and 7 respectively while the federal funds target rate remained unchanged at a range of zero to 025 the average threemonth treasury bill yield increased by 4 basis points to 008 during 2012 compared to 2011  at the same time the average 10year treasury yield decreased by 98 basis points to 178 

  

despite continuing economic and interest rate challenges during the year the company’s sustained client focus helped deliver strong key client activity metrics in 2012  while net new client assets decreased slightly by 4 to  1397 billion in 2012  core net new client assets totaled 1124 billion up 37 from 823 billion in 2011  total client assets ended the year at a record  195 trillion up 16 from 2011 in addition the company added 900000 new brokerage accounts to its client base during 2012  a decrease of 21 from the prior year due to the removal of approximately 30000 accounts due to escheatment and other factors in 2012 and the addition of 315000 new brokerage accounts from the acquisition of optionsxpress in 2011   active brokerag e accounts reached a record 88   million up 3 from 2011  

  

net revenues increased by 4  in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to increases in asset management and administration fees net interest revenue and other revenue – net partially offset by a decrease in trading revenue asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to increases in advice solutions fees and other asset management and administration fees net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of interestearning assets partially offset by the effect of low overall interest rates and higher amortization of premiums relating to mortgagebacked securities other revenue – net increased primarily due to a nonrecurring gain of 70 million relating to a confidential resolution of a vendor dispute in the second quarter of 2012 trading revenue decreased primarily due to lower daily average revenue trades partially offset by the inclusion of optionsxpress’ trading activity from its acquisition in september 2011 

  

expenses excluding interest were higher by 4 in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of optionsxpress’ expenses taxes on income in 2012 include a nonrecurring state tax benefit of 20 million recorded in the third quarter of 2012 overall growth in the company’s client base and ongoing expense discipline helped the company increase net income by 7 in 2012 from 2011 and achieve a pretax profit margin of 297 and return on common stockholders’ equity of 11 in 2012 

  

  

current market and regulatory environment and other developments 

  

to the extent shortterm interest rates remain at current low levels the company’s net interest revenue will continue to be constrained even as growth in average balances helps to increase such revenue the low shortterm interest rate environment also affects asset management and administration fees the company continues to waive a portion of its management fees    as the overall yields on certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds have remained at levels at or below the management fees on those funds  these and certain other schwabsponsored money market mutual funds may not be able to replace maturing securities with securities of equal or higher yields as a result the yields on such funds may remain around or decline from their current levels and therefore below the stated management fees on those funds to the extent this occurs asset management and administration fees may continue to be negatively affected 

  

in july 2013 the us banking agencies issued regulatory capital rules that implemented basel iii and relevant provisions of the doddfrank act final regulatory capital rules which are applicable to savings and loan holding companies such as csc and federal savings banks such as schwab bank the rules will be phased in beginning on january 1 2015

net interest revenue 

  

net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on funding sources net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies the majority of the company’s interestearnings assets and interestbearing liabilities are sensitive to changes in shortterm interest rates the company’s investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall when interest rates fall the company may attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lock in asset yields and by lowering rates paid to clients on interestbearing liabilities since the company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients as well as the rates charged on receivables from brokerage clients and also controls the composition of its investment securities it has some ability to manage its net interest spread however the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition the current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources to a lesser degree the company is sensitive to changes in longterm interest rates through some of its investment portfolios to mitigate the related risk the company may alter the types of investments purchased for discussion of the impact of current market conditions on net interest revenue see “current market and regulatory environment and other developments”

csc’s liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries as well as cash provided by external financing csc has a universal automatic shelf registration statement shelf registration statement on file with the sec which enables csc to issue debt equity  and other securities csc maintains excess liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and shortterm investments to cover daily funding needs and to support growth in the company’s business generally csc does not hold liquidity at its subsidiaries in excess of amounts deemed sufficient to support the subsidiaries’ operations including any regulatory capital requirements schwab schwab bank and optionsxpress inc are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with csc as further discussed below management believes that funds generated by the operations of csc’s subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting csc’s liquidity needs providing adequate liquidity to meet schwab bank’s capital guidelines and maintaining schwab and optionsxpress inc’s net capital 

  

on july 25 2013 csc issued 275 million of senior notes that mature in 2018 under its shelf registration statement the senior notes have a fixed interest rate of 220 with interest payable semiannually

the following are details of csc’s longterm debt 

  



  

csc has authorization from its board of directors to issue unsecured commercial paper notes commercial paper notes not to exceed 15 billion management has set a current limit for the commercial paper program of 800 million the maturities of the commercial paper notes may vary but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue the commercial paper is not redeemable prior to maturity and cannot be voluntarily prepaid the proceeds of the commercial paper program are to be used for general corporate purposes there were no borrowings of commercial paper notes outstanding at december 31 2013 csc’s ratings for these shortterm borrowings are p1 by moody’s a1 by standard  poor’s and f1 by fitch 

  

csc maintains an 800 million committed unsecured credit facility with a group of 12 banks which is scheduled to expire in june 2014  this facility replaced a simila r facility that expired in june 2013 and both facilities were unused in 2013  the funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes the financial covenants under this facility require schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio as defined schwab bank to be well capitalized as defined and csc to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity at december 31 2013  the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was  71 billion csc’s stockholders’ equity at december 31 2013  was  104 billion management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on csc’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements

schwab 

  

schwab’s liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts which were  332 billion and  374 billion at december 31 2013 and 2012  respectively management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for schwab 

  

schwab is subject to regulatory requirements of rule 15c31 under the securities exchange act of 1934 the uniform net capital rule that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of brokerdealers these regulations prohibit schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings from csc paying cash dividends or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5 of aggregate debit balances or less than 120 of its minimum dollar requirement of  250000  at december 31 2013  schwab’s net capital was  14 billion  10  of aggregate debit balances which was  12 billion in excess of its minimum required net capital and  707 million in excess of 5 of aggregate debit balances 

  

schwab is also subject to rule 15c33 under the securities exchange act of 1934 and other applicable regulations that require it to maintain cash or qualified securities in a segregated reserve account for the exclusive benefit of clients these funds are included in cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes in the company’s consolidated balance sheets and are not available as a general source of liquidity 

  

most of schwab’s assets are readily convertible to cash consisting primarily of shortterm ie less than 150 days investmentgrade interestearning investments the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements receivables from brokerage clients and receivables from brokers dealers and clearing organizations client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities receivables from and payables to brokers dealers and clearing organizations primarily represent current open transactions which usually settle or can be closed out within a few business days 

  

schwab has a finance lease obligation related to an office building and land under a 20year lease the remaining finance lease obligation of  89 million at december 31 2013  is being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term of 11 years 

  

to manage shortterm liquidity schwab maintains uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines with a group of six banks totaling  942 million at december 31 2013  the need for shortterm borrowings arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements scheduled liquidation of interestearnings investments and movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements schwab used such borrowings for ten days in 2013  with average daily amounts borrowed of  64 million there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at december 31 2013  

  

to partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the options clearing corporation schwab has unsecured standby letter of credit agreements locs with five banks in favor of the options clearing corporation aggregating  225 million at december 31 2013  there were no funds drawn under any of these locs during 2013 in connection with its securities lending activities schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients schwab satisfies the collateral requirements by providing cash as collateral  

  

to manage schwab’s regulatory capital requirement csc provides schwab with a 14 billion subordinated revolving credit facility which is scheduled to expire in march 2014 schwab plans to renew this facility when it expires the amount outstanding under this facility at december 31 2013  was  315 million borrowings under this subordinated lending arrangement qualify as regulatory capital for schwab 

  

in addition csc provides schwab with a 25 billion credit facility which is scheduled to expire in december 2014 borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for schwab the amount outstanding under this facility at december 31 2013 was 605 million

address the action plans for certain capital events with low probability but high severity that the company might face the c apital contingency plan is issued under the authority of the assetliability management and pricing committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events it does not specifically address every contingency but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress 

  

capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at capital   planning and assetliability management and pricing committee meetings and semi  annually at the company’s board of directors meetings exceptions to internal guidelines are also reviewed at quarterly g lobal risk committee meetings 

  

  

fair value of financial instruments 

  

the company uses the market and income approaches to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value and to determine fair value disclosures see “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – 2 summary of significant accounting policies and 16 fair values of assets and liabilities” for more information on the company’s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 

  

when available the company uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities when utilizing market data with a bidask spread the company uses the price within the bidask spread that best represents fair value when quoted prices do not exist the company uses prices obtained from independent thirdparty pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets the company generally obtains prices from at least three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value and may obtain up to five prices on assets with higher risk of limited observable information such as nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities the company’s primary independent pricing service provides prices based on observable trades and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads and weightedaverage maturity for the same or similar “tobeissued” securities the company compares the prices obtained from its primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable the company does not adjust the prices received from independent thirdparty pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts at december 31 2013 and 2012 the company did not adjust prices received from the primary independent thirdparty pricing service 

  

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

the consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us while the majority of the company’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are not based on estimates  there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the c ompany’s financial position and reported financial results these critical accounting estimates are described below  management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the company’s financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy 

  

otherthantemporary impairment of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity 

  

management evaluates whether securities available for sale and securities held to maturity are otherthantemporarily impaired otti on a quarterly basis debt securities with unrealized losses are considered otti if the company intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such security before any anticipated recovery if management determines that a security is otti under these circumstances the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between the amortized cost and the thencurrent fair value 

  

a security is also otti if management does not expect to recover the amortized cost of the security in this circumstance t he impairment recognized in earnings represents estimated credit loss and is measured by the difference between the present 

44   

 

the charles schwab corporation 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted 

value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security management utilizes cash flow models to estimate the expected future cash flow from the securities and to estimate the credit loss expected cash flows are discounted using the security’s effective interest rate 

  

the evaluation of whether the company expects to recover the amortized cost of a security is inherently judgmental the evaluation includes the assessment of several bond performance indicators including the portion of the underlying loans that are delinquent 30 days 60 days 90 days in bankruptcy in foreclosure or converted to real estate owned the actual amount of loss incurred on the underlying loans in which the property has been foreclosed and sold the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security available to absorb credit losses on the underlying loans the current price and magnitude of the unrealized loss and whether the company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments management uses cash flow models to further assess the likelihood of otherthantemporary impairment for the company’s nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities to develop the cash flow models the company uses forecasted loss severity prepayment speeds ie the rate at which the principal on underlying loans are paid down and default rates over the securities’ expected remaining maturities 

  

valuation of goodwill 

  

the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever indications of impairment exist impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value resulting in an impairment charge for this excess adverse changes in the company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition a loss of key personnel the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the company’s recorded goodwill 

  

the company’s annual goodwill impairment testing date is april 1 st  in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on april 1 2013  management performed a qualitative assessment of each of the company’s reporting units generally defined as the company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management and concluded that goodwill was not impaired 

  

allowance for loan losses 

  

the appropriateness of the allowance is reviewed quarterly by management taking into consideration current economic conditions the existing loan portfolio composition past loss experience and risks inherent in the portfolio 

  

the methodology to establish an allowance for loan losses related to the first mortgage and heloc portfolio utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments defaults and probable losses for the loan segments based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the segments the methodology considers the effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including but not limited to interest rates housing price movements as measured by a housing price index economic conditions estimated defaults and foreclosures measured by historical and expected delinquencies changes in prepayment speeds ltv ratios past loss experience estimates of future loss severities borrower credit risk measured by fico scores and the adequacy of collateral the methodology also evaluates concentrations in the loan segments including loan products year of origination and geographical distribution of collateral 

  

probable losses are forecast using a loanlevel simulation of the delinquency status of the loans over the term of the loans the simulation starts with the current relevant risk indicators including the current delinquent status of each loan the estimated current ltv ratio of each loan the term and structure of each loan current key interest rates including us treasury and london interbank offered rate libor rates and borrower fico scores the more significant variables in the simulation include delinquency roll rates loss severity housing prices and interest rates delinquency roll rates ie the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result in a loss are estimated from the company’s historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information further the delinquency roll rates within the loanlevel simulation discussed above are calibrated to match a moving average of the delinquency roll rates actually experienced in the respective first mortgage and heloc portfolios loss severity estimates are based on the company’s historical loss experience and market trends the estimated loss severity ie loss given default used in the allowance for loan loss methodology for helocs is higher than that used in the methodology for first mortgages housing price trends are

derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values factors affecting the home price index include housing inventory unemployment interest rates and inflation expectations interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths as a result the current state of house prices and the current state of delinquencies unique to the company’s first mortgage and heloc portfolios are considered in the allowance for loan loss methodology   this methodology results in loss factors that are applied to the outstanding balances to determine the allowance for loan loss for each loan segment 

  

the allowance for personal loans secured by securities is established on a loan by loan basis the market value of collateral pledged by borrowers is regularly reviewed to ensure the company’s commitment to extend credit is overcollateralized if collateral is in danger of falling below specified levels the company may reduce a borrower’s committed line or may liquidate collateral at december 31 2013 and 2012 the allowance for loan losses related to personal loans secured by securities was immaterial 

  

legal and regulatory reserves 

  

reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter after considering among other factors the progress of the case prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases available defenses insurance coverage and indemnification and the opinions and views of legal counsel in many cases including most class action lawsuits it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred or to estimate the range of that loss until the matter is close to resolution in which case no accrual is made until that time reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved 

  

the company’s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee additionally management has reviewed with the audit committee the company’s significant estimates discussed in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

  

market risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by the company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or market conditions 

  

the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on its interestearning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources that finance these assets   the majority of the company’s interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities are sensitive to changes in shortterm interest rates to a lesser degree the company is sensitive to changes in longterm interest rates through some of its investment portfolios to manage the company’s market risk related to interest rates management utilizes simulation models which include the net interest revenue sensitivity analysis described below 

  

net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets include residential real estate loans and mortgagebacked securities these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and to changes to prepayment levels which tend to increase in a declining rate environment because the company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients and the rates charged on margin loans and loans to banking clients and controls the composition of its investment securities it has some ability to manage its net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions 

  

to mitigate the risk of loss the company has established policies and procedures that include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interestearning assets and funding sources to remain within these guidelines the company manages the maturity repricing and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios 

  

the company is also subject to market risk as a result of fluctuations in option and equity prices the company’s direct holdings of option and equity securities and its associated exposure to option and equity prices are not material the company is indirectly exposed to option and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option accounts securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers and customer securities loaned out as part of the company’s securities lending activities equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity margin borrowing and overall client engagement with the company additionally the company earns mutual fund service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the company 

  

financial instruments held by the company are also subject to liquidity risk – that is the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument recent conditions in the credit markets have significantly reduced market liquidity in a wide range of financial instruments including certain instruments held by the company and fair value can differ significantly from the value implied by the credit quality and actual performance of the instrument’s underlying cash flows 

  

for discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – current market and regulatory environment and other developments” 

  

the company’s market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material 

  

net interest revenue simulation 

  

for the company’s net interest revenue sensitivity analysis the company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulation includes all interestsensitive assets and liabilities key variables in the simulation include the repricing of financial instruments prepayment reinvestment and product pricing assumptions the company uses constant balances and market rates in the simulation assumptions in order to 

48   

 

the charles schwab corporation 

minimize the number of variables and to better isolate risks the simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and as a result cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies including changes in asset and liability mix 

  

if the company’s guidelines for its net interest revenue sensitivity are breached management must report the breach to the company’s corporate assetliability management and pricing committee corporate alco and establish a plan to address the interest rate risk this plan could include but is not limited to rebalancing certain investment portfolios or using derivative instruments to mitigate the interest rate risk depending on the severity and expected duration of the breach as well as the then current interest rate environment the plan could also be to take no action any plan that recommends taking action is required to be approved by the company’s corporate alco there were   no breaches of the company’s net interest revenue sensitivity guidelines during the years ending december 31 2013 or 2012    

  

as represented by the simulations presented below the company’s investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall 

  

t he simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as the company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood the company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the results of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to the company’s current market rates forecast on simulated net interest revenue over the next 12 months beginning december 31 2013 and 2012 

  



  

the sensitivities shown in the simulation reflect the fact that shortterm interest rates in 2013 remained at historically low levels including the federal funds target rate which was unchanged at a range of zero to 025 the yearoveryear decrease in net interest income sensitivity reflects the baseline assumption of higher medium and longerterm rates at december 31 2013 relative to those assumed at december 31 2012 resulting in a higher basis for comparison  the current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources in a declining interest rate scenario a decline in interest rates could therefore negatively impact the yield on the company’s investment portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense further compressing net interest margin any increases in shortterm interest rates result in a greater impact as yields on interestearning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources

the company’s competition in serving individual investors includes a wide range of brokerage wealth management and asset management firms as well as banks and trust companies in serving these investors and competing for a growing percentage of the investable wealth in the us the company offers a multichannel service delivery model which includes online mobile telephonic and branch capabilities under this model the company can offer personalized service at competitive prices while giving clients the choice of where when and how they do business with the company schwab’s branches and regional telephone service centers are staffed with trained and experienced financial consultants fcs focused on building and sustaining client relationships the company offers the ability to meet client investing needs through a single ongoing point of contact even as those needs change over time in particular management believes that the company’s ability to provide those clients seeking help guidance or advice with an integrated individually tailored solution – ranging from occasional consultations to an ongoing relationship with a schwab fc or an ia – is a competitive strength compared to the more fragmented offerings of other firms 

  

the company’s online mobile and telephonic channels provide quick and efficient access to an extensive array of information research tools trade execution and administrative services which clients can access according to their needs for example clients that trade more actively can use these channels to access highly competitive pricing expert tools and extensive service capabilities – including experienced knowledgeable teams of trading specialists and integrated product offerings individuals investing for retirement through 401k plans can take advantage of the company’s bundled offering of multiple investment choices education and thirdparty advice management also believes the company is able to compete with the wide variety of financial services firms striving to attract individual client relationships by complementing these capabilities with the extensive array of investment banking and lending products and services described in the following section

schwab bank is subject to regulation and supervision and to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state laws including regulatory capital guidelines among other things these requirements also restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions such as extensions of credit and repayment of loans between schwab bank and csc or csc’s other subsidiaries in addition schwab bank is required to provide notice to and may be required to obtain approval of the occ and the federal reserve to declare dividends to csc the federal banking agencies have broad powers to enforce these regulations including the power to terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver under the federal deposit insurance act schwab bank could be subject to restrictive actions if it were to fall within one of the lowest three of five capital categories schwab bank is required to maintain minimum capital levels as specified in federal banking laws and regulations failure to meet the minimum levels could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on schwab bank 

  

the securities industry in the united states is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws csc’s principal us brokerdealers are schwab and optionsxpress inc schwab is registered as a brokerdealer with the united states securities and exchange commission sec the fifty states and the district of columbia and puerto rico

the charles schwab corporation 

  

optionsxpress inc is registered as a brokerdealer with the sec the fifty states the district of columbia puerto rico and the virgin islands schwab and csim are registered as investment advisors with the sec additionally schwab and optionsxpress inc are regulated by the commodities futures trading commission cftc with respect to the commodity futures and commodities trading activities they conduct as an introducing broker and futures commission merchant respectively 

  

much of the regulation of brokerdealers has been delegated to selfregulatory organizations sros schwab and optionsxpress inc are members of the financial industry regulatory authority inc finra the municipal securities rulemaking board msrb nyse arca and the chicago board options exchange cboe optionsxpress inc is also a member of other exchanges the primary regulators of schwab are finra and for municipal securities the msrb the primary regulators of optionsxpress inc are finra cboe and for municipal securities the msrb the national futures association nfa is schwab and optionsxpress inc’s primary regulator for futures and commodities trading activities the company’s business is also subject to oversight by regulatory bodies in other countries in which the company operates

schwab and optionsxpress inc are both subject to rule 15c31 under the securities exchange act of 1934 the uniform net capital rule and related sro requirements the cftc and nfa also impose net capital requirements the uniform net capital rule specifies minimum capital requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of brokerdealers because csc itself is not a registered brokerdealer it is not subject to the uniform net capital rule however if schwab fails to maintain specified levels of net capital such failure would constitute a default by csc under debt covenants under csc’s credit agreement 

  

the uniform net capital rule limits brokerdealers’ ability to transfer capital to parent companies and other affiliates compliance with the uniform net capital rule could limit schwab’s operations and its ability to repay subordinated debt to csc which in turn could limit csc’s ability to repay debt pay cash dividends and purchase shares of its outstanding stock

 item 1a risk factors tableend the company faces a variety of risks that may affect its operations or financial results and many of those risks are driven by factors that the company cannot control or predict the following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant although there may be other risks that could arise or may prove to be more significant than expected that may affect the company’s operations or financial results 

for a discussion of the company’s risk management including operational risk credit risk and market risk see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – risk management” 

developments in the business economic and geopolitical environment could negatively impact the company’s business 

the company’s business can be adversely affected by the general environment – economic corporate securities market regulatory and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations trading activity interest rates and overall investor engagement and are outside of the company’s control deterioration in the housing and credit markets reductions in shortterm interest rates and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact the company’s net interest revenue asset management and administration fees and capital resources 

a significant decrease in the company’s liquidity could negatively affect the company’s business and financial management as well as reduce client confidence in the company 

maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to the business operations of the company including margin lending mortgage lending and transaction settlement among other liquidity needs the company meets its liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by client activity and operating earnings as well as cash provided by external financing fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances as well as changes in market conditions may affect the company’s ability to meet its liquidity needs a reduction in the company’s liquidity position could reduce client confidence in the company which could result in the loss of client accounts in addition if the company’s brokerdealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to csc which could reduce csc’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt and pay cash dividends in addition csc may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries 

factors which may adversely affect the company’s liquidity position include a reduction in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts a dramatic increase in the company’s client lending activities including margin and personal lending unanticipated outflows of company cash increased capital requirements other regulatory changes or a loss of market or customer confidence in the company schwab may also experience temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between clients’ transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances 

when cash generated by client activity and operating earnings is not sufficient for the company’s liquidity needs the company must seek external financing during periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets potential sources of external financing could be reduced and borrowing costs could increase although csc and schwab maintain committed and uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines and csc has a commercial paper issuance program as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets in addition a significant downgrade in the company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets

the company may suffer significant losses from its credit exposures 

  

the company’s businesses are subject to the risk that a client counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate while the company has policies and procedures designed to manage this risk the policies and procedures may not be fully effective the company’s exposure mainly results from margin lending activities securities lending activities mortgage lending activities its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds that the company sponsors 

  

when clients purchase securities on margin the company is subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities held as collateral falls below the amount of clients’ indebtedness abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses 

  

the company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale and securities held to maturity portfolios which include us agency and nonagency mortgagebacked securities consumer loan assetbacked securities corporate debt securities certificates of deposit us agency notes and commercial paper among other investments these instruments are also subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial market’s assessment of issuer credit quality increases in the unemployment rate delinquency and default rates housing price declines changes in prevailing interest rates and other economic factors 

  

loss of value of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such securities are other than temporarily impaired the evaluation of whether otherthantemporary impairment exists is a matter of judgment which includes the assessment of several factors see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting estimates” if management determines that a security is otherthantemporarily impaired the cost basis of the security may be adjusted and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings certain securities available for sale experienced continued credit deterioration in 2012 which resulted in impairment charges deterioration in the performance of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity could result in the recognition of future impairment charges 

  

the company’s loans to banking clients primarily consist of first mortgages and helocs increases in delinquency and default rates housing price declines increases in the unemployment rate and other economic factors can result in charges for loan loss reserves and write downs on such loans 

  

heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments concentration risk can increase the company’s risk of loss examples of the company’s credit concentration risk include 

  

   

   

   

the company may also be subject to concentration risk when lending to a particular counterparty borrower or issuer 

  

the company sponsors a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds although the company has no obligation to do so the company may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit liquidity or other support to its funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity such support could cause the company to take significant charges could reduce the company’s liquidity and in certain situations could with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds result in the company having to consolidate a supported fund in its financial statements if the company chose not to provide credit liquidity or other support in such a situation the company could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected

significant interest rate changes could affect the company’s profitability and financial condition 

  

the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interestearning assets such as cash equivalents short and longterm investments and mortgage and margin loans relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources including deposits in banking and brokerage accounts shortterm borrowings and longterm debt changes in interest rates generally affect the interest earned on interestearning assets differently than the interest the company pays on its interestbearing liabilities in addition certain funding sources do not bear interest and their cost therefore does not vary overall the company is positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment the company could be adversely affected by a decline in interest rates if the rates that the company earns on interestearning assets decline more than the rates that the company pays on its funding sources or if prepayment rates increase on the mortgages and mortgagebacked securities that the company holds with the low interest rate environment the company’s yield on interestearning assets has been declining more than the average rate that the company pays on its funding sources the company may also be limited in the amount it can reduce interest rates on deposit accounts and still offer a competitive return 

  

to the extent the overall yield on certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds falls to a level at or below the management fees on those funds the company may waive a portion of its fee in order to continue providing some return to clients as a result of the low interest rate environment the company has been waiving and may continue to waive a portion of its management fees for certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds such fee waivers negatively impact the company’s asset management and administration fees 

  

the company is subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending itself against claims or proceedings 

  

the financial services industry faces substantial litigation and regulatory risks the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business including arbitrations class actions and other litigation some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages the company is also the subject of inquiries investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies 

  

litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by the company’s clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied at the company claims from clients of third party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors’ misconduct litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights eg patents such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources if the company were found to have infringed a thirdparty patent or other intellectual property rights it could incur substantial damages and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology or providing certain products or services 

  

actions brought against the company may result in settlements awards injunctions fines penalties or other results adverse to the company including reputational harm even if the company is successful in defending against these actions the defense of such matters may result in the company incurring significant expenses predicting the outcome of matters is inherently difficult particularly where claims are brought on behalf of various classes of claimants claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages or when investigations or legal proceedings are at an early stage a substantial judgment settlement fine or penalty could be material to the company’s operating results or cash flows for a particular future period depending on the company’s results for that period in market downturns the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased see “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – 15 commitments and contingencies” 

  

extensive regulation of the company’s businesses limits the company’s activities and may subject it to significant penalties 

  

as a participant in the securities banking and financial services industries the company is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws by governmental agencies supervisory authorities and sros such regulation becomes more extensive and complex in response to market disruptions the requirements imposed by the company’s regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets the safety and soundness of financial institutions and the protection of clients these regulations often serve to limit the company’s activities by way of capital customer protection and market 

  

 9  

the charles schwab corporation 

  

conduct requirements and restrictions on the businesses activities that the company may conduct despite the company’s efforts to comply with applicable regulations there are a number of risks particularly in areas where applicable regulations may be unclear or where regulators revise their previous guidance any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by the company’s regulators against the company or its affiliates officers or employees could result in fines penalties cease and desist orders enforcement actions suspension or expulsion or other disciplinary sanctions including limitations on the company’s business activities any of which could harm the company’s reputation and adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively impact the company’s business and financial results 

  

new legislation rule changes or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal state and sro rules and regulations including changes relating to money market mutual funds brokerdealer fiduciary duties and mortgage products and services may directly affect the operation and profitability of the company or its specific business lines the profitability of the company could also be affected by rules and regulations which impact the business and financial communities generally including changes to the laws governing taxation electronic commerce client privacy and security of client data in addition the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business the company conducts modifications to the company’s business practices increased capital requirements or additional costs 

  

financial reforms and related regulations may affect the company’s business activities financial position and profitability 

  

the doddfrank act was signed into law in july 2010 and implementation is ongoing this legislation makes extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and significant rulemaking and interpretation remains in addition the legislation mandates multiple studies which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action among other things the legislation authorizes various assessments and fees and requires the establishment of minimum leverage and riskbased capital requirements for insured depository institutions and requires the sec to complete studies and develop rules regarding various investor protection issues the legislation also charges the federal reserve with drafting enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” csc has not been designated as “systemically important” but could be designated in the future the legislation also eliminated the office of thrift supervision ots effective july 21 2011 and as a result the federal reserve became csc’s primary regulator and the occ became the primary regulator of schwab bank csc is continuing to review the impact the legislation studies and related rulemaking will have on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in 2012 the federal reserve issued notices of proposed rulemaking nprs to meet certain requirements of the doddfrank act and to align current capital rules with the basel iii capital standards the nprs would subject all savings and loan holding companies including csc to consolidated capital requirements in addition the nprs would establish more restrictive capital definitions higher riskweightings for certain asset classes higher minimum capital ratios and capital buffers the company expects the capital standard rules to be phased in under an extended timeframe after adoption the comment period for the nprs ended on october 22 2012 and the nprs are subject to further modification csc continues to monitor developments in order to assess the impact of the nprs but does not expect them to have a material impact on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the legislation also established a new independent consumer financial protection bureau which has broad rulemaking supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer products including mortgages homeequity loans and credit cards states will be permitted to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and state attorney generals can enforce consumer protection rules issued by the bureau these rules may negatively impact the range of products offered and profitability of our loan products 

  

the legislation gives the sec discretion to adopt rules regarding standards of conduct for brokerdealers providing investment advice to retail customers the various studies required by the legislation could result in additional rulemaking or legislative action which could impact the company’s business and financial results 

  

the changes resulting from the legislation may impact the profitability of the company’s business activities require changes to certain of its business practices impose upon the company more stringent capital liquidity and leverage ratio requirements

the charles schwab corporation 

  

or otherwise adversely affect the company’s business these changes may also require the company to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes 

  

technology and operational failures or errors could subject the company to losses litigation and regulatory actions 

  

the company faces operational risk which is the potential for loss due to inadequate or failed internal processes systems and firms or exchanges handling client orders or from external events and relationships impacting the company andor any of its key business partners and vendors this risk also includes the risk of human error execution errors employee misconduct unauthorized trading external fraud computer viruses distributed denial of service attacks terrorist attacks natural disaster capacity constraints and software flaws it could take several hours or more to restore full functionality to the company’s technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen event which could affect the company’s ability to process and settle client transactions moreover instances of fraud or other misconduct including improper use or disclosure of confidential client employee or company information might also negatively impact the company’s reputation and client confidence in the company in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances despite the company’s efforts to identify areas of risk oversee operational areas involving risk and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer unexpected losses reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors including those of its vendors or other third parties 

  

while the company devotes substantial attention and resources to the reliability capacity and scalability of its systems extraordinary trading volumes could cause the company’s computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail affecting the company’s ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients’ orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses and decreased client satisfaction the company is also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges clearing houses and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement systems failures and constraints and transaction error at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices cause substantial losses for the company and for its clients and subject the company to claims from its clients for damages 

  

the company relies on outsourced service providers to perform key functions 

  

the company relies on external service providers to perform certain key technology processing servicing and support functions these service providers face technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of the company’s confidential client employee or company information could cause the company to incur losses and could harm the company’s reputation an interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints financial difficulties or for any other reason and the company’s inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt the company’s operations impact the company’s ability to offer certain products and services and result in financial losses to the company switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations 

  

security breaches of the company’s systems or those of its clients or third parties may subject the company to significant liability and damage the company’s reputation 

  

the company’s business involves the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential information about the company and its clients information security risks for financial institutions are increasing in part because of the use of the internet and mobile technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime activists hackers and other external parties the company’s systems and those of other financial institutions have been and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks malicious code computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access misuse loss or destruction of data including confidential customer information account takeovers unavailability of service or other events despite the company’s efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems the company may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means for example actions by a suborned employee 

  

 11  

the charles schwab corporation 

  

  

security breaches including breaches of the company’s security measures or those of the company’s thirdparty service providers or clients could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject the company to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance actions by the company’s regulators damage to the company’s reputation or a loss of confidence in the company’s security measures which could harm the company’s business the company may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures 

  

the company also faces risk related to external fraud involving the compromise of clients’ personal electronic devices that can facilitate the unauthorized access to login and password information for their various online financial accounts including those at the company such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties for example these parties send fraudulent “phishing” emails to the company’s clients in order to misappropriate user names passwords or other personal information losses reimbursed to clients under the company’s guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on the company’s financial position 

  

the company evaluates potential strategic transactions including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions any such transaction could have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows the process of evaluating negotiating and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert management’s attention from other business concerns and might cause the loss of key clients employees and business partners moreover integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties including the need to integrate operational financial and management information systems and management controls integrate relationships with clients and business partners and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas in addition an acquisition may cause the company to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation further the company may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition and any future acquisition could be dilutive to the company’s current stockholders’ percentage ownership or to earnings per common share

the company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees net interest revenue and trading revenue the company generates asset management and administration fees through its proprietary and thirdparty mutual fund offerings as well as feebased advisory solutions net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on funding sources asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue are impacted by securities valuations interest rates the amount and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing funding sources the company’s ability to attract new clients and client activity levels the company generates trading revenue through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenue primarily from trading activity in client fixed income securities trading revenue is impacted by trading volumes the volatility of prices in the equity and fixed income markets and commission rates 

  

2012 compared to 2011 

  

the broad equity markets improved during 2012 compared to 2011 as the nasdaq composite index standard  poor’s 500 index and dow jones industrial average increased 16 13 and 7 respectively while the federal funds target rate remained unchanged at a range of zero to 025 the average threemonth treasury bill yield increased by 4 basis points to 008 during 2012 compared to 2011 at the same time the average 10year treasury yield decreased by 98 basis points to 178 

  

despite continuing economic and interest rate challenges during the year the company’s sustained client focus helped deliver strong key client activity metrics in 2012 while net new client assets decreased slightly by 4 to 1397 billion in 2012 core net new client assets totaled 1124 billion up 37 from 823 billion in 2011 total client assets ended the year at a record 195 trillion up 16 from 2011 in addition the company added 900000 new brokerage accounts to its client base during 2012 and active brokerage accounts reached a record 88 million up 3 from 2011 

  

net revenues increased by 4 in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to increases in asset management and administration fees net interest revenue and other revenue – net partially offset by a decrease in trading revenue asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to increases in advice solutions fees and other asset management and administration fees net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of interestearning assets partially offset by the effect of low overall interest rates and higher amortization of premiums relating to mortgagebacked securities other revenue – net increased primarily due to a pretax gain of 70 million relating to a confidential resolution of a vendor dispute in the second quarter of 2012 trading revenue decreased primarily due to lower daily average revenue trades partially offset by the inclusion of optionsxpress’ trading activity from its acquisition in september 2011 

  

expenses excluding interest were higher by 4 in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of optionsxpress’ expenses taxes on income in 2012 include a nonrecurring state tax benefit of 20 million recorded in the third quarter of 2012 overall growth in the company’s client base and ongoing expense discipline helped the company increase net income by 7 in 2012 from 2011 and achieve a pretax profit margin of 297 and return on common stockholders’ equity of 11 in 2012 

  

2011 compared to 2010 

  

economic and market conditions were challenging throughout 2011 marked by volatility in the equity markets lower market valuations and further declines in interest rates the standard  poor’s 500 index nasdaq composite index and dow jones industrial average decreased on average 6 5 and 4 respectively between the first and second halves of the year the federal funds target rate remained unchanged during the year at a range of zero to 025 and the average threemonth treasury bill and average 10year treasury yields declined by 8 and 43 basis points to 004 and 276 respectively

the company’s key client activity metrics in 2011 were stable in the midst of a weakened economic and market environment net new client assets totaled 1459 billion in 2011 core net new client assets totaled 823 billion in 2011 up 5 from 781 billion in 2010 total client assets ended the year at 168 trillion up 7 from 2010 in addition the company added 11 million new brokerage accounts to its client base during 2011 and ended the year serving 86 million active brokerage accounts 

net revenues increased by 10 in 2011 from 2010 due to increases in all of the company’s major sources of net revenues asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to an increase in advice solutions fees and continued asset inflows partially offset by a decrease in net money market mutual fund fees net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of interestearning assets during the year partially offset by the effect of lower interest rate spreads resulting from higher amortization of premiums relating to residential mortgagebacked securities caused by higher mortgage prepayments in 2011 trading revenue increased primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades and the addition of optionsxpress’ trading activity 

while total expenses excluding interest were lower by 5 in 2011 compared to 2010 the company experienced increases in compensation and benefits professional services occupancy and equipment and advertising and market development expenses in aggregate of 266 million in 2011 compared to 2010 significant charges in 2010 included class action litigation and regulatory reserves relating to the schwab yieldplus fund ®  losses recognized for schwab money market mutual funds and a charge relating to the termination of the company’s invest first ® and worldpoints a visa b credit card program for a total of 482 million 

as a result of the company’s ongoing investment in clients and sustained expense discipline the company achieved a pretax profit margin of 297 and return on common stockholders’ equity of 12 in 2011 

current market and regulatory environment and other developments 

as discussed above interest rates remained at low levels during 2012 to the extent rates remain at these low levels the company’s net interest revenue will continue to be constrained even as growth in average balances helps to increase such revenue the low interest rate environment also affects asset management and administration fees while net money market mutual fund fees improved in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to sustained improvement in shortterm interest rates the overall yields on certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds have remained at levels at or below the management fees on those funds the company continues to waive a portion of its management fees so that the funds can maintain a positive return to clients these and other money market mutual funds may not be able to replace maturing securities with securities of equal or higher yields as a result the yields on such funds may remain around or decline from their current levels and therefore below the management fees on those funds to the extent this occurs asset management and administration fees may be negatively affected 

the company recorded net impairment losses of 32 million related to certain nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities in 2012 primarily due to further credit deterioration of the securities’ underlying loans further deterioration in the performance of the underlying loans in the company’s nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities portfolio could result in the recognition of additional impairment losses 

the doddfrank act was signed into law in july 2010 among other things the legislation transferred the supervision and regulation of csc from the ots to the federal reserve and supervision and regulation of schwab bank from the ots to the occ both transfers were effective july 21 2011 in 2012 the federal reserve issued notices of proposed rulemaking nprs to meet certain requirements of the doddfrank act and to align current capital rules with the basel iii capital standards the nprs would subject all savings and loan holding companies including csc to consolidated capital requirements in

addition the nprs would establish more restrictive capital definitions higher riskweightings for certain asset classes higher minimum capital ratios and capital buffers the company expects the capital standard rules to be phased in under an extended time frame after adoption the comment period for the nprs ended on october 22 2012 and the nprs are subject to further modification csc continues to monitor developments in order to assess the impact of the nprs but does not expect them to have a material impact on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the company is pursuing lawsuits in state court in san francisco for rescission and damages against issuers underwriters and dealers of individual nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities on which the company has experienced realized and unrealized losses the lawsuits allege that offering documents for the securities contained material untrue and misleading statements about the securities and the underwriting standards and credit quality of the underlying loans on january 27 2012 and july 24 2012 the court denied defendants’ motions to dismiss the claims with respect to all but 3 of the 51 securities and discovery is proceeding

asset management and administration fees 

asset management and administration fees include mutual fund service fees and fees for other assetbased financial services provided to individual and institutional clients the company earns mutual fund service fees for shareholder services administration and investment management provided to its proprietary funds and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to thirdparty funds these fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds the company also earns asset management fees for advice solutions which include advisory and managed account services that are based on the daily balances of client assets subject to the specific fee for service the fair values of client assets included in proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data other asset management and administration fees include various asset based fees such as thirdparty mutual fund service fees trust fees 401k record keeping fees and mutual fund clearing and other service fees asset management and administration fees may vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity for discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees see “current market and regulatory environment and other developments” 

asset management and administration fees increased by 115 million or 6 in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to increases in advice solutions fees and other asset management and administration fees asset management and administration fees increased by 106 million or 6 in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to an increase in advice solutions fees partially offset by a decrease in mutual fund service fees 

mutual fund service fees were relatively flat in 2012 from 2011 which reflected growth in client asset balances invested in money market mutual funds equity and bond funds and mutual fund onesource funds offset by the effect of lower yields on certain mutual fund assets mutual fund service fees decreased by 59 million or 5 in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to a decrease in net money market mutual fund fees as a result of lower yields on fund assets partially offset by higher mutual fund onesource fees 

advice solutions fees increased by 58 million or 11 in 2012 from 2011 and by 138 million or 36 in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to growth in client assets enrolled in retail advisory and managed account programs including windhaven ® and schwab managed portfolios tm  the increase in advice solutions fees in 2011 from 2010 was also due to temporary fees rebates of 63 million which reduced advice solutions fees in 2010 under a rebate program that ended in 2010 

other asset management and administration fees increased by 43 million or 14 in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to an increase in thirdparty mutual fund service fees as a result of an increase in client asset balances invested in other thirdparty mutual funds 

net interest revenue 

net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on funding sources net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies the company’s investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall ie interestearning assets generally reprice more quickly than interestbearing liabilities when interest rates fall the company may attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lock in asset yields and by lowering rates paid to clients on interestbearing liabilities since the company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients as well as the rates charged on receivables from brokerage clients and also controls the composition of its investment securities it has some ability to manage its net interest spread the current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources however the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition for discussion of the impact of current market conditions on net interest revenue see “current market and regulatory environment and other developments”

liquidity 

csc 

csc’s liquidity needs arise from funding its subsidiaries’ operations including margin and mortgage lending and transaction settlement in addition to funding cash dividends acquisitions investments short and longterm debt and managing statutory capital requirements 

csc’s liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries as well as cash provided by external financing csc has a universal automatic shelf registration statement shelf registration statement on file with the sec which enables csc to issue debt equity and other securities csc maintains excess liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and shortterm investments to cover daily funding needs and to support growth in the company’s business generally csc does not hold liquidity at its subsidiaries in excess of amounts deemed sufficient to support the subsidiaries’ operations including any regulatory capital requirements schwab schwab bank and optionsxpress inc are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with csc as further discussed below management believes that funds generated by the operations of csc’s subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting csc’s liquidity needs providing adequate liquidity to meet schwab bank’s capital guidelines and maintaining schwab and optionsxpress inc’s net capital 

while csc is not currently subject to specific statutory capital requirements csc is required to serve as a source of strength for schwab bank and must have the ability to provide financial assistance if schwab bank experiences financial distress to manage capital adequacy the company currently utilizes a target tier 1 leverage ratio as defined by the federal reserve of at least 6 at december 31 2012 the company’s tier 1 leverage ratio was 65 tier 1 capital ratio was 169 and total capital ratio was 170

csc has authorization from its board of directors to issue unsecured commercial paper notes commercial paper notes not to exceed 15 billion management has set a current limit for the commercial paper program of 800 million the maturities of the commercial paper notes may vary but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue the commercial paper is not redeemable prior to maturity and cannot be voluntarily prepaid the proceeds of the commercial paper program are to be used for general corporate purposes at december 31 2012 the amount of commercial paper notes outstanding was 300 million which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the company’s consolidated balance sheets the amount outstanding was repaid on january 2 2013 csc’s ratings for these shortterm borrowings are p1 by moody’s a1 by standard  poor’s and f1 by fitch 

  

csc maintains an 800 million committed unsecured credit facility with a group of 11 banks which is scheduled to expire in june 2013 this facility replaced a similar facility that expired in june 2012 and was unused in 2012 the funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes the financial covenants under this facility require schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio as defined schwab bank to be well capitalized as defined and csc to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity at december 31 2012 the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was 58 billion csc’s stockholders’ equity at december 31 2012 was 96 billion management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on csc’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements 

  

csc also has direct access to 642 million of the 842 million uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines discussed below that are primarily utilized by schwab to manage shortterm liquidity these lines were not used by csc during 2012 

  

in addition schwab provides csc with a 10 billion credit facility maturing in december 2014 there were no funds drawn under this facility at december 31 2012 

  

schwab 

  

liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts which were 374 billion and 335 billion at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for schwab 

  

schwab is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of brokerdealers these regulations prohibit schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings from csc paying cash dividends or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5 of aggregate debit balances or less than 120 of its minimum dollar requirement of 250000 at december 31 2012 schwab’s net capital was 14 billion 9 of aggregate debit balances which was 11 billion in excess of its minimum required net capital and 623 million in excess of 5 of aggregate debit balances 

  

schwab is also subject to rule 15c33 under the securities exchange act of 1934 and other applicable regulations that require it to maintain cash or qualified securities in a segregated reserve account for the exclusive benefit of clients these funds are included in cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes in the company’s consolidated balance sheets and are not available as a general source of liquidity 

  

most of schwab’s assets are readily convertible to cash consisting primarily of shortterm ie less than 150 days investmentgrade interestearning investments the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements receivables from brokerage clients and receivables from brokers dealers and clearing

organizations client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities receivables from and payables to brokers dealers and clearing organizations primarily represent current open transactions which usually settle or can be closed out within a few business days 

  

schwab has a finance lease obligation related to an office building and land under a 20year lease the remaining finance lease obligation of 95 million at december 31 2012 is being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term of 12 years 

  

to manage shortterm liquidity schwab maintains uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines with a group of six banks totaling 842 million at december 31 2012 the need for shortterm borrowings arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements scheduled liquidation of interestearnings investments and movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements schwab used such borrowings for three days in 2012 with average daily amounts borrowed of 62 million there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at december 31 2012 

  

to partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the options clearing corporation schwab has unsecured standby letter of credit agreements locs with five banks in favor of the options clearing corporation aggregating 325 million at december 31 2012 in connection with its securities lending activities schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients schwab satisfies the collateral requirements by arranging locs in favor of these brokerage clients which are issued by multiple banks at december 31 2012 the aggregate face amount of these locs totaled 74 million there were no funds drawn under any of these locs during 2012 

  

to manage schwab’s regulatory capital requirement csc provides schwab with a 14 billion subordinated revolving credit facility which is scheduled to expire in march 2014 the amount outstanding under this facility at december 31 2012 was 315 million borrowings under this subordinated lending arrangement qualify as regulatory capital for schwab 

  

in addition csc provides schwab with a 25 billion credit facility which is scheduled to expire in december 2014 borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for schwab there were no funds drawn under this facility at december 31 2012

schwab bank is required to maintain capital levels as specified in federal banking laws and regulations failure to meet the minimum levels could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on schwab bank based on its regulatory capital ratios at december 31 2012 schwab bank is considered well capitalized schwab bank’s regulatory capital and ratios at december 31 2012 are as follows 

  

  

na not applicable 

  

in the third quarter of 2012 management lowered its target tier 1 leverage ratio for schwab bank from at least 75 to at least 625 this change reflects schwab bank’s approach to lending and investing which results in a lower risk profile relative to the industry and riskbased capital ratios significantly in excess of well capitalized levels this allows greater flexibility in managing capital resources to either support schwab bank’s balance sheet growth or return capital to csc 

  

schwab bank has access to traditional funding sources such as deposits federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements additionally schwab bank has access to shortterm funding through the federal reserve bank frb discount window amounts available under the frb discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain of schwab bank’s securities available for sale andor securities held to maturity that are pledged as collateral schwab bank maintains policies and procedures necessary to access this funding and tests discount window borrowing procedures annually at december 31 2012 28 billion was available under this arrangement there were no funds drawn under this arrangement during 2012

optionsxpress 

  

liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts which were 11 billion at december 31 2012 management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for optionsxpress inc 

  

optionsxpress inc a whollyowned subsidiary of optionsxpress is a registered brokerdealer and is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of brokerdealers these regulations prohibit optionsxpress inc from paying cash dividends or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5 of aggregate debit balances or less than 120 of its minimum dollar requirement of 250000 at december 31 2012 optionsxpress inc’s net capital was 87 million 40 of aggregate debit balances which was 82 million in excess of its minimum required net capital and 76 million in excess of 5 of aggregate debit balances

misappropriation of client or company assets by third parties including through unauthorized access to company systems and data and client accounts the frequency and sophistication of such fraud attempts continue to increase

the company faces significant legal and compliance risk in its business and the volume of litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed have been increasing among other things these risks relate to the suitability of client investments conflicts of interest disclosure obligations and performance expectations for company products and services supervision of employees and the adequacy of the company’s controls claims against the company may increase due to a variety of factors such as if clients suffer losses during a period of deteriorating equity market conditions as the company increases the level of advice it provides to clients and as the company enhances the services it provides to ias in addition the company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal state and foreign regulatory authorities and sros and such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex 

  

the company attempts to manage legal and compliance risk through policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid litigation claims and prevent or detect violations of applicable legal and regulatory requirements these procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics sales and trading practices marketing and communications extension of credit

credit risk 

  

credit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower counterparty or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations the company’s direct exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending activities securities lending activities mortgage lending activities its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and other investing activities to manage the risks of such losses the company has established policies and procedures which include establishing and reviewing credit limits monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties and adjusting margin requirements for certain securities collateral arrangements relating to margin loans securities lending agreements and resale agreements include provisions that require additional collateral in the event that market fluctuations result in declines in the value of collateral received additionally for margin loan and securities lending agreements collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral exceeds the amounts loaned 

  

the company’s credit risk exposure related to loans to banking clients is actively managed through individual and portfolio reviews performed by management management regularly reviews asset quality including concentrations delinquencies nonaccrual loans chargeoffs and recoveries all are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for loan losses which is reviewed quarterly by management the company’s mortgage loan portfolios primarily include first mortgages of 65 billion and helocs of 33 billion at december 31 2012 

  

the company’s first mortgage portfolio underwriting requirements are generally consistent with the underwriting requirements in the secondary market for loan portfolios the company’s underwriting guidelines include maximum loantovalue ltv ratios cash out limits and minimum fair isaac corporation fico credit scores the specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan for example whether the property is a primary or secondary residence whether the loan is for investment property whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home and whether the loan is conforming or jumbo these credit underwriting standards have limited the exposure to the types of loans that experienced high foreclosures and loss rates elsewhere in the industry in recent years there have been no significant changes to the ltv ratio or fico credit score underwriting guidelines related to the company’s first mortgage or heloc portfolios during 2012 the company does not offer loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a fico credit score of less than 620 at origination unless the borrower has compensating credit factors at december 31 2012 approximately 1 of both the first mortgage and heloc portfolios consisted of loans to borrowers with updated fico credit scores of less than 620 

  

at december 31 2012 the weightedaverage originated ltv ratios were 60 and 59 for the first mortgage and heloc portfolios respectively the computation of the origination ltv ratio for a heloc includes any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of origination at december 31 2012 22 of helocs 725 million of the heloc portfolio were in a first lien position the weightedaverage originated fico credit score was 768 for both the first mortgage and heloc portfolios 

  

the company monitors the estimated current ltv ratios of its first mortgage and heloc portfolios on an ongoing basis at december 31 2012 the weightedaverage estimated current ltv ratios were 62 and 72 for the first mortgage and heloc portfolios respectively the computation of the estimated current ltv ratio for a heloc includes any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of the heloc’s origination the company estimates the current ltv ratio for each loan by reference to a home price appreciation index the company also monitors updated borrower fico scores delinquency trends and verified liquid assets held by individual borrowers at december 31 2012 the weightedaverage updated fico scores were 768 and 767 for the first mortgage and heloc portfolios respectively 

  

a portion of the company’s heloc portfolio is secured by second liens on the associated properties second lien mortgage loans possess a higher degree of credit risk given the subordination to the first lien holder in the event of default at

the company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale and securities held to maturity portfolios whose fair values totaled 461 billion and 187 billion at december 31 2012 respectively these portfolios include us agency and nonagency mortgagebacked securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities certificates of deposit us agency notes commercial paper and other securities us agency mortgagebacked securities do not have explicit credit ratings however management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the us governmentsponsored enterprises included in nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities are securities collateralized by loans that are considered to be “prime” defined by the company as loans to borrowers with a fico credit score of 620 or higher at origination and “alta” defined by the company as prime loans with reduced documentation at origination 

  

residential mortgagebacked securities particularly alta securities experienced continued credit deterioration in 2012 including increased payment delinquency rates and losses on foreclosures of underlying mortgages for a discussion of the impact of current market conditions on residential mortgagebacked securities see “current market and regulatory environment and other developments” at december 31 2012 the amortized cost of nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities represented 2 of the total mortgagebacked securities portfolio these securities were originated between 2003 and 2007 at december 31 2012 all of the corporate debt securities and nonmortgage assetbacked securities were rated investment grade defined as a rating equivalent to a moody’s rating of “baa” or higher or a standard  poor’s rating of “bbb” or higher

the fair value of the company’s investments in mortgagebacked securities totaled 395 billion at december 31 2012 of these 388 billion were issued by us agencies and 733 million were issued by private entities nonagency securities the us agency securities are included in securities available for sale and securities held to maturity and the nonagency securities are included in securities available for sale included in nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities are securities collateralized by alta loans at december 31 2012 the amortized cost and fair value of alta mortgagebacked securities were 308 million and 269 million respectively 

  

the company’s investments in corporate debt securities and commercial paper totaled 80 billion at december 31 2012 with the majority issued by institutions in the financial services industry these securities are included in securities available for sale securities held to maturity cash and cash equivalents and other securities owned in the company’s consolidated balance sheets 

  

the company’s loans to banking clients include 60 billion of adjustable rate first lien residential real estate mortgage loans at december 31 2012 the company’s adjustable rate mortgages have initial fixed interest rates for three to ten years and interest rates that adjust annually thereafter approximately 50 of these mortgages consisted of loans with interestonly payment terms the interest rates on approximately 65 of these interestonly loans are not scheduled to reset for three or more years the company’s mortgage loans do not include interest terms described as temporary introductory rates below current market rates at december 31 2012 45 of the residential real estate mortgages and 50 of the heloc balances were secured by properties which are located in california 

  

the company’s heloc product has a 30year loan term with an initial draw period of 10 years from the date of origination after the initial draw period the balance outstanding at such time is converted to a 20year amortizing loan the interest rate during the initial draw period and the 20year amortizing period is a floating rate based on the prime rate plus a margin the following table presents when current outstanding helocs will convert to amortizing loans 

  

   

as of december 31 2012 all of the company’s heloc loans are within the 10year initial draw period and as such none of the helocs have converted to an amortizing loan 

  

the company also has exposure to concentration risk from its margin and securities lending activities collateralized by securities of a single issuer or industry this concentration risk is mitigated by collateral arrangements that require the fair value of such collateral exceeds the amounts loaned 

  

the company has indirect exposure to us government and agency securities held as collateral to secure its resale agreements the company’s primary credit exposure on these resale transactions is with its counterparty the company would have exposure to the us government and agency securities only in the event of the counterparty’s default on the resale agreements the fair value of us government and agency securities held as collateral for resale agreements totaled 197 billion at december 31 2012

european holdings 

  

the company has exposure to nonsovereign financial and nonfinancial institutions in europe the following table shows the balances of this exposure by each country in europe in which the issuer or counterparty is domiciled the company has no direct exposure to sovereign governments in europe the company does not have unfunded commitments to counterparties in europe nor does it have exposure as a result of credit default protection purchased or sold separately as of december 31 2012 

  

the determination of the domicile of exposure varies by the type of investment for time deposits and certificates of deposit the exposure is grouped in the country in which the financial institution is chartered under the regulatory framework of the european country for assetbacked commercial paper the exposure is grouped by the country of the sponsoring bank that provides the credit and liquidity support for such instruments for corporate debt securities the exposure is grouped by the country in which the issuer is domiciled in situations in which the company invests in a corporate debt security of a us subsidiary of a european parent company such holdings will be attributable to the european country only if significant reliance is placed on the european parent company for credit support underlying the security for substantially all of the holdings listed below the issuers or counterparties were financial institutions all of the company’s resale agreements which are included in investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes are collateralized by us government securities additionally the company’s securities lending activities are collateralized by cash therefore the company’s resale agreements and securities lending activities are not included in the table below even if the counterparty is a european institution

management mitigates exposure to european holdings by employing a separate team of credit analysts that evaluate each issuer counterparty and country management monitors its exposure to european issuers by 1 performing risk assessments of the foreign countries which include evaluating the size of the country and economy currency trends political landscape and the countries’ regulatory environment and developments 2 performing ad hoc stress tests that evaluate the impact of sovereign governments’ debt writedowns on the issuers and counterparties to our investments 3 reviewing publicly available stress tests that are published by various regulators in the european market 4 establishing credit and maturity limits by issuer and 5 monitoring aggregate exposures by country 

market risk 

market risk is the potential for changes in revenue or the value of financial instruments held by the company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or market conditions for discussion of the company’s market risk see “item 7a – quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

fair value of financial instruments 

the company uses fair value measurements to record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value and to determine fair value disclosures assets are measured at fair value using quoted prices or marketbased information and accordingly are classified as level 1 or level 2 measurements in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described in fair value measurement accounting guidance liabilities recorded at fair value were not material at december 31 2012 or 2011 see “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – 2 summary of significant accounting policies and 17 fair values of assets and liabilities” for more information on the company’s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 

when available the company uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities when utilizing market data with a bidask spread the company uses the price within the bidask spread that best represents fair value when quoted prices do not exist the company uses prices obtained from independent thirdparty pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets the company generally obtains prices from at least three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value and may obtain up to five prices on assets with higher risk of limited observable information such as nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities the company’s primary independent pricing service provides prices based on observable trades and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads and weightedaverage maturity for the same or similar “tobeissued” securities the company compares the prices obtained from its primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable the company does not adjust the prices received from independent thirdparty pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts at december 31 2012 and 2011 the company did not adjust prices received from the primary independent thirdparty pricing service 

critical accounting estimates 

the consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us while the majority of the company’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are not based on estimates there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position and 

  

 42  

the charles schwab corporation 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted 

  

reported financial results these critical accounting estimates are described below management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the company’s financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy 

  

otherthantemporary impairment of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity 

  

management evaluates whether securities available for sale and securities held to maturity are otherthantemporarily impaired otti on a quarterly basis debt securities with unrealized losses are considered otti if the company intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such security prior to any anticipated recovery if management determines that a security is otti under these circumstances the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between the amortized cost and the thencurrent fair value 

  

a security is also otti if management does not expect to recover the amortized cost of the security in this circumstance management utilizes cash flow models to estimate the expected future cash flow from the securities and to estimate the credit loss the impairment recognized in earnings is measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security expected cash flows are discounted using the security’s effective interest rate 

  

the evaluation of whether the company expects to recover the amortized cost of a security is inherently judgmental the evaluation includes the assessment of several bond performance indicators including the portion of the underlying loans that are delinquent 30 days 60 days 90 days in bankruptcy in foreclosure or converted to real estate owned the actual amount of loss incurred on the underlying loans in which the property has been foreclosed and sold the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security available to absorb credit losses on the underlying loans the current price and magnitude of the unrealized loss and whether the company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments management uses cash flow models to further assess the likelihood of otherthantemporary impairment for the company’s nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities to develop the cash flow models the company uses forecasted loss severity prepayment speeds ie the rate at which the principal on underlying loans are paid down and default rates over the securities’ expected remaining maturities 

  

valuation of goodwill 

  

the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever indications of impairment exist impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value resulting in an impairment charge for this excess adverse changes in the company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition a loss of key personnel the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the company’s recorded goodwill 

  

the company’s annual goodwill impairment testing date is april 1 st  in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on april 1 2012 the fair values of the company’s reporting units generally defined as the company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management substantially exceeded their carrying values and therefore management concluded that no amount of goodwill was impaired the estimated fair values of the reporting units were established using a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit and a market capitalization analysis as allowed by applicable accounting standards the company can elect to qualitatively assess goodwill for impairment if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value 

  

allowance for loan losses 

  

the appropriateness of the allowance is reviewed quarterly by management taking into consideration current economic conditions the existing loan portfolio composition past loss experience and risks inherent in the portfolio 

  

the methodology to establish an allowance for loan losses utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments defaults and probable losses for the loan segments based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the segments the methodology considers the effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including but not limited to interest rates housing price 

  

 43

movements as measured by a housing price index economic conditions estimated defaults and foreclosures measured by historical and expected delinquencies changes in prepayment speeds loantovalue ltv ratios past loss experience estimates of future loss severities borrower credit risk measured by fico scores and the adequacy of collateral the methodology also evaluates concentrations in the loan segments including loan products year of origination geographical distribution of collateral and the portion of borrowers who have other client relationships with the company 

  

probable losses are forecast using a loanlevel simulation of the delinquency status of the loans over the term of the loans the simulation starts with the current relevant risk indicators including the current delinquent status of each loan the estimated current ltv ratio of each loan the term and structure of each loan current key interest rates including us treasury and london interbank offered rate libor rates and borrower fico scores the more significant variables in the simulation include delinquency roll rates loss severity housing prices and interest rates delinquency roll rates ie the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result in a loss are estimated from the company’s historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information further the delinquency roll rates within the loanlevel simulation discussed above are calibrated to match a moving average of the delinquency roll rates actually experienced in the respective first mortgage and heloc portfolios loss severity estimates are based on the company’s historical loss experience and market trends the estimated loss severity ie loss given default used in the allowance for loan loss methodology for helocs is higher than that used in the methodology for first mortgages housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values factors affecting the home price index include housing inventory unemployment interest rates and inflation expectations interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths as a result the current state of house prices including the decrease in general house prices experienced over the last several years as well as the current state of delinquencies unique to the company’s first mortgage and heloc portfolios are considered in the allowance for loan loss methodology 

  

this methodology results in loss factors that are applied to the outstanding balances to determine the allowance for loan loss for each loan segment 

  

legal and regulatory reserves 

  

reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter after considering among other factors the progress of the case prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases available defenses insurance coverage and indemnification and the opinions and views of legal counsel in many cases including most class action lawsuits it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred or to estimate the range of that loss until the matter is close to resolution in which case no accrual is made until that time reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved 

  

the company’s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee additionally management has reviewed with the audit committee the company’s significant estimates discussed in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

market risk is the potential for changes in revenue or the value of financial instruments held by the company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or market conditions 

  

for the company’s market risk related to interest rates a sensitivity analysis referred to as a net interest revenue simulation model is shown below the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on its interestearning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources that finance these assets 

  

net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets include residential real estate loans and mortgagebacked securities these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and to changes to prepayment levels which tend to increase in a declining rate environment 

  

to mitigate the risk of loss the company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interestearning assets and funding sources to remain within these guidelines the company manages the maturity repricing and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios because the company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients the rates charged on margin loans and controls the composition of its investment securities it has some ability to manage its net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions 

  

the company is also subject to market risk as a result of fluctuations in equity prices the company’s direct holdings of equity securities and its associated exposure to equity prices are not material the company is indirectly exposed to equity market fluctuations in connection with securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers and customer securities loaned out as part of the company’s securities lending activities equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity margin borrowing and overall client engagement with the company additionally the company earns mutual fund service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the company 

  

financial instruments held by the company are also subject to liquidity risk – that is the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument recent conditions in the credit markets have significantly reduced market liquidity in a wide range of financial instruments including the types of instruments held by the company and fair value can differ significantly from the value implied by the credit quality and actual performance of the instrument’s underlying cash flows 

  

financial instruments held by the company are also subject to valuation risk as a result of changes in valuations of the underlying collateral such as housing prices in the case of residential real estate loans and mortgagebacked securities 

  

for discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees net interest revenue and securities available for sale see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – current market and regulatory environment and other developments” 

  

the company’s market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material 

  

net interest revenue simulation 

  

the company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulation model the model includes all interestsensitive assets and liabilities key variables in the model include the repricing of financial instruments prepayment reinvestment and product pricing assumptions the company uses constant balances and market rates in the model assumptions in order to minimize the number of variables and to better isolate risks the simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and as a result cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue actual results may differ from simulated 

  

 47  

the charles schwab corporation 

  

results due to balance growth or decline and the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies including changes in asset and liability mix 

  

as represented by the simulations presented below the company’s investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall ie interestearning assets generally reprice more quickly than interestbearing liabilities 

  

the simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as the company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood the company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the results of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to the company’s current market rates forecast on simulated net interest revenue over the next 12 months beginning december 31 2012 and 2011 

  

   

the sensitivities shown in the simulation reflect the fact that shortterm interest rates in 2012 remained at historically low levels including the federal funds target rate which was unchanged at a range of zero to 025 the current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources in a declining interest rate scenario a decline in interest rates could therefore negatively impact the yield on the company’s investment portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense further compressing net interest margin any increases in shortterm interest rates result in a greater impact as yields on interestearning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources

business strategy and competitive environment 

  

the company’s strategy is to meet the financial services needs of investors advisors and employers through its two segments to pursue its strategy the company focuses on building client loyalty innovating in ways that benefit clients operating in a disciplined manner and leveraging its strengths through shared core processes and technology platforms the company provides clients with a compelling combination of personalized relationships superior service and great value delivered through a blend of people and technology people provide the client focus and personal touch that are essential in serving investors while technology helps create services that are scalable and consistent this combination helps the company address a wide range of client needs – from tools and information for selfdirected or active investors to advice solutions to retirement and equitybased incentive plans to support services for independent ias – while enabling each client to easily utilize some or all of these capabilities according to their unique circumstances 

  

the company’s competition in serving individual investors includes a wide range of brokerage wealth management and asset management firms as well as banks and trust companies in serving these investors and competing for a growing percentage of the investable wealth in the us the company offers a multichannel service delivery model which includes branch telephonic mobile and online capabilities under this model the company can offer personalized service at competitive prices while giving clients the choice of where when and how they do business with the company schwab’s branches and regional telephone service centers are staffed with trained and experienced financial consultants fcs focused on building and sustaining client relationships the company offers the ability to meet client investing needs through a single ongoing point of contact even as those needs change over time in particular management believes that the company’s ability to provide those clients seeking help guidance or advice with an integrated individually tailored solution – ranging from occasional consultations to an ongoing relationship with a schwab fc or an ia – is a competitive strength compared to the more fragmented offerings of other firms 

  

the company’s online telephonic and mobile channels provide quick and efficient access to an extensive array of information research tools trade execution and administrative services which clients can access according to their needs for example as clients trade more actively they can use these channels to access highly competitive pricing expert tools and extensive service capabilities – including experienced knowledgeable teams of trading specialists and integrated product offerings individuals investing for retirement through 401k plans can take advantage of the company’s bundled offering of multiple investment choices education and thirdparty advice management also believes the company is able to compete with the wide variety of financial services firms striving to attract individual client relationships by complementing these capabilities with the extensive array of investment banking and lending products and services described in the following section

another important aspect of the company’s ability to compete is its ongoing focus on efficiency and productivity as lower costs give the company greater flexibility in its approach to pricing and investing for growth management believes that this flexibility remains important in light of the competitive environment in which a number of competitors offer reduced online trading commission rates and lower expense ratios on certain classes of mutual funds and exchangetraded funds additionally the company’s nationwide marketing effort is an important competitive tool because it reinforces the attributes of the schwab ® brand

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

the company faces a variety of risks that may affect its operations or financial results and many of those risks are driven by factors that the company cannot control or predict the following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant although there may be other risks that could arise or may prove to be more significant than expected that may affect the company’s operations or financial results 

  

for a discussion of the company’s risk management including technology and operating risk credit risk concentration risk market risk fiduciary risk and legal and regulatory risk see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – risk management” 

  

developments in the business economic and geopolitical environment could negatively impact the company’s business 

  

the company’s business can be adversely affected by the general environment – economic corporate securities market regulatory and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations trading activity interest rates and overall investor engagement and are outside of the company’s control deterioration in the housing and credit markets reductions in shortterm interest rates and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact the company’s net interest revenue asset management and administration fees and capital resources 

  

a significant decrease in the company’s liquidity could negatively affect the company’s business and financial management as well as reduce client confidence in the company 

  

maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to the business operations of the company including margin lending mortgage lending and transaction settlement among other liquidity needs the company meets its liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by client activity and operating earnings as well as cash provided by external financing fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances as well as changes in market conditions may affect the company’s ability to meet its liquidity needs a reduction in the company’s liquidity position could reduce client confidence in the company which could result in the loss of client accounts in addition if the company’s brokerdealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to csc which could reduce csc’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt and pay cash dividends in addition csc may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries 

  

factors which may adversely affect the company’s liquidity position include a reduction in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts a dramatic increase in the company’s client lending activities including margin and personal lending unanticipated outflows of company cash increased capital requirements other regulatory changes or a loss of market or customer confidence in the company schwab may also experience temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between clients’ transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances 

  

when cash generated by client activity and operating earnings is not sufficient for the company’s liquidity needs the company must seek external financing during periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets potential sources of external financing could be reduced and borrowing costs could increase although csc and schwab maintain committed and uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines and csc has a commercial paper issuance program as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions and disruptions in the credit markets in addition a significant downgrade in the company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets

the company may suffer significant losses from its credit exposures 

  

the company’s businesses are subject to the risk that a client counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate while the company has policies and procedures designed to manage this risk the policies and procedures may not be fully effective the company’s exposure mainly results from margin lending activities securities lending activities mortgage lending activities its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds that the company sponsors 

  

the company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale and securities held to maturity portfolios which include us agency and nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities consumer loan assetbacked securities corporate debt securities us agency notes and certificates of deposit among other investments these instruments are also subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial market’s assessment of issuer credit quality increases in the unemployment rate delinquency and default rates housing price declines changes in prevailing interest rates and other economic factors 

  

loss of value of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity can result in charges if management determines that the impairments are other than temporary the evaluation of whether otherthantemporary impairment exists is a matter of judgment which includes the assessment of several factors see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting estimates” if management determines that a security is otherthantemporarily impaired the cost basis of the security may be adjusted and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings certain securities available for sale experienced continued credit deterioration in 2011 which resulted in impairment charges deterioration in the performance of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity could result in the recognition of future impairment charges 

  

the company’s loans to banking clients primarily consist of firstlien residential real estate mortgage loans and helocs increases in delinquency and default rates housing price declines increases in the unemployment rate and other economic factors can result in charges for loan loss reserves and write downs on such loans 

  

heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments concentration risk can increase the company’s risk of loss examples of the company’s credit concentration risk include 

  

   

   

   

the company may also be subject to concentration risk when lending to a particular counterparty borrower or issuer 

  

the company sponsors a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds although the company has no obligation to do so the company may decide for competitive reasons to provide credit liquidity or other support to its funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity such support could cause the company to take significant charges and could reduce the company’s liquidity if the company chose not to provide credit liquidity or other support in such a situation the company could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected 

  

significant interest rate changes could affect the company’s profitability and financial condition 

  

the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interestearning assets such as cash equivalents short and longterm investments and mortgage and margin loans relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources including deposits in banking and brokerage accounts shortterm borrowings and longterm debt changes in interest rates generally affect the interest earned on interestearning assets differently than the interest the company pays on its interestbearing liabilities in addition certain funding sources do not bear interest and their cost therefore does not vary overall the company is positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment the company could be adversely affected by a decline in interest rates if the rates that the company earns on interestearning assets decline more than the rates

the charles schwab corporation 

  

that the company pays on its funding sources or if prepayment rates increase on the mortgages and mortgagebacked securities 

that the company holds with the low interest rate environment the company’s revenue from interestearning assets has been declining more than the rates that the company pays on its funding sources the company may also be limited in the amount it can reduce interest rates on deposit accounts and still offer a competitive return 

  

to the extent the overall yield on certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds falls to a level at or below the management fees on those funds the company may waive a portion of its fee in order to continue providing some return to clients as a result of the low interest rate environment the company has been waiving and may continue to waive a portion of its management fees for certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds such fee waivers negatively impact the company’s asset management and administration fees 

  

the company is subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not always be successful in defending itself against such claims or proceedings 

  

the financial services industry faces substantial litigation and regulatory risks the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business including arbitrations class actions and other litigation some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages the company is also the subject of inquiries investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies actions brought against the company may result in settlements awards injunctions fines penalties or other results adverse to the company including reputational harm even if the company is successful in defending against these actions the defense of such matters may result in the company incurring significant expenses predicting the outcome of matters is inherently difficult particularly where claims are brought on behalf of various classes of claimants claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages or when investigations or legal proceedings are at an early stage a substantial judgment settlement fine or penalty could be material to the company’s operating results or cash flows for a particular future period depending on the company’s results for that period in market downturns the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased see “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – 15 commitments and contingencies” 

  

from time to time the company is subject to litigation claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights eg patents such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources if the company was found to have infringed a thirdparty patent or other intellectual property rights it could incur substantial liability and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology or providing certain products or services 

  

extensive regulation of the company’s businesses limits the company’s activities and may subject it to significant penalties 

  

as a participant in the securities banking and financial services industries the company is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws by governmental agencies supervisory authorities and sros such regulation has become more extensive and complex in response to the recent market disruptions the requirements imposed by the company’s regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets the safety and soundness of financial institutions and the protection of clients these regulations often serve to limit the company’s activities by way of capital customer protection and market conduct requirements and restrictions on the businesses activities that the company may conduct despite the company’s efforts to comply with applicable regulations there are a number of risks particularly in areas where applicable regulations may be unclear or where regulators revise their previous guidance any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by the company’s regulators against the company or its affiliates officers or employees could result in fines penalties cease and desist orders enforcement actions suspension or expulsion or other disciplinary sanctions including limitations on the company’s business activities any of which could harm the company’s reputation and adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively impact the company’s business and financial results

financial reforms and related regulations may affect the company’s business activities financial position and profitability 

  

the “doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act” was signed into law in july 2010 this legislation makes extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and requires significant rulemaking in addition the legislation mandates multiple studies which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action among other things the legislation authorizes various assessments and fees and requires the establishment of minimum leverage and riskbased capital requirements for insured depository institutions and requires the sec to complete studies and develop rules regarding various investor protection issues the legislation also eliminated the office of thrift supervision effective july 21 2011 and as a result the federal reserve became csc’s primary regulator and the office of the comptroller of the currency became the primary regulator of schwab bank csc is continuing to review the impact the legislation studies and related rulemaking will have on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the legislation charges the federal reserve with drafting enhanced regulatory requirements for “systemically important” bank holding companies and certain other nonbank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” by the financial stability oversight council which may include csc the enhanced requirements include more stringent capital leverage and liquidity standards the legislation permits the federal reserve to tailor its enhanced requirements to the perceived risk profile of an individual financial institution among other things the legislation authorizes various assessments and fees requires the establishment of minimum leverage and riskbased capital requirements for insured depository institutions bans proprietary trading by insured depository institutions and affiliates and requires the sec to complete studies and develop rules regarding various investor protection issues 

  

the legislation also established a new independent consumer financial protection bureau which has broad rulemaking supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer products including mortgages homeequity loans and credit cards states will be permitted to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and state attorney generals can enforce consumer protection rules issued by the bureau 

  

the legislation gives the sec discretion to adopt rules regarding standards of conduct for brokerdealers providing investment advice to retail customers the various studies required by the legislation could result in additional rulemaking or legislative action which could impact the company’s business and financial results 

  

the changes resulting from the legislation may impact the profitability of the company’s business activities require changes to certain of its business practices impose upon the company more stringent capital liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect the company’s business these changes may also require the company to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes

mutual fund offerings as well as feebased advisory solutions net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on funding sources asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue are impacted by securities valuations interest rates the amount and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing funding sources the company’s ability to attract new clients and client activity levels the company generates trading revenue through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenue from trading activity in fixed income securities trading revenue is impacted by trading volumes the volatility of prices in the equity and fixed income markets and commission rates 

  

2011 compared to 2010 

  

economic and market conditions were challenging throughout 2011 marked by volatility in the equity markets lower market valuations and further declines in interest rates the standard and poor’s 500 index nasdaq composite index and dow jones industrial average decreased on average 6 5 and 4 respectively between the first and second halves of the year the federal funds target rate remained unchanged during the year at a range of zero to 025 and the threemonth treasury bill and 10year treasury yields declined by 11 and 141 basis points to 001 and 188 respectively 

  

the company’s key client activity metrics in 2011 were stable in the midst of a weakened economic and market environment net new client assets totaled 1459 billion in 2011 core net new client assets which exclude significant onetime flows totaled 823 billion in 2011 up from 781 billion in 2010 total client assets ended the year at 168 trillion up 7 from 2010 in addition clients’ daily average trades were 451100 up 13 from 2010 

  

net revenues increased by 10 in 2011 from 2010 due to increases in all of the company’s major sources of net revenues asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to an increase in revenue from the company’s advice solutions and continued asset inflows partially offset by money market mutual fund fee waivers which increased to 568 million in 2011 from 433 million in 2010 net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of interestearning assets during the year partially offset by the effect of lower interest rate spreads resulting from higher amortization of premiums relating to residential mortgagebacked securities caused by higher mortgage prepayments in 2011 trading revenue increased primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades and the addition of optionsxpress which was acquired in september 2011 

  

while total expenses excluding interest were lower by 5 in 2011 compared to 2010 the company experienced increases in compensation and benefits professional services occupancy and equipment and advertising and market development expenses in aggregate of 266 million in 2011 compared to 2010 significant charges in 2010 included class action litigation and regulatory reserves relating to the schwab yieldplus fund ®  losses recognized for schwab money market mutual funds and a charge relating to the termination of the company’s invest first ® and worldpoints a visa b  credit card program for a total of 482 million 

  

as a result of the company’s ongoing investment in clients and sustained expense discipline the company achieved a pretax profit margin of 297 and return on stockholders’ equity of 12 in 2011 

  

2010 compared to 2009 

  

the equity markets improved during 2010 and remained well above their prior year lows the nasdaq composite index the standard  poor’s 500 index and the dow jones industrial average increased 17 13 and 11 respectively the low interest rate environment continued throughout the year as the federal funds target rate remained unchanged during the year at a range of zero to 025 

  

the company’s sustained investment in expanding and improving product and service capabilities for its clients was reflected in the strength of its key client activity metrics in 2010 – net new client assets totaled 781 billion excluding

outflows related to a single mutual fund clearing client who completed a planned transfer to an internal platform during the year and total client assets ended 2010 at 157 trillion up 11 from 2009 client trading activity slowed during the year as clients’ daily average trades decreased 4 from 2009 to 399700 

  

net revenues were relatively flat in 2010 from 2009 the company however experienced a change in the mix of its revenue sources as the increase in net interest revenue was offset by decreases in trading revenue asset management and administration fees and other revenue net interest revenue increased due to higher average balances of interestearning assets partially offset by a decrease in the average yield earned trading revenue decreased due to lower average revenue per revenue trade resulting from improved online trade pricing for clients which was implemented in january 2010 and slightly lower daily average revenue trades in 2010 while the low interest rate environment caused over 200 million of additional money market mutual fund fee waivers from the prior year the decrease in asset management and administration fees was limited to 3 due to higher average asset valuations and continued asset inflows other revenue was lower in comparison to 2009 primarily due to a gain of 31 million on the repurchase of a portion of the company’s longterm debt in 2009 

  

expenses excluding interest were higher by 19 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the recognition of certain significant charges in 2010 the company recognized class action litigation and regulatory reserves of 320 million relating to the schwab yieldplus fund additionally the company decided to cover the net remaining losses recognized by schwab money market mutual funds as a result of their investments in a single structured investment vehicle that defaulted in 2008 and recorded a charge of 132 million in 2010 also as a result of challenging credit card industry economics the company ended its sponsorship in its invest first ® and worldpoints a visa b  credit cards and recorded a charge of 30 million the company’s ongoing expense discipline helped limit the growth in all other expense categories in the aggregate to 3 over the prior year 

  

business acquisitions 

  

on september 1 2011 the company completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding common shares of optionsxpress an online brokerage firm primarily focused on equity option securities and futures for total consideration of 714 million under the terms of the merger agreement optionsxpress ® stockholders received 102 shares of the company’s common stock for each share of optionsxpress stock as a result the company issued 59 million shares of the company’s common stock valued at 710 million based on the closing price of the company’s common stock on september 1 2011 the company also assumed optionsxpress’ stockbased compensation awards valued at 4 million

current market and regulatory environment 

  

the economic and market environment was challenging throughout 2011 further declines in interest rates continue to constrain growth in the company’s net revenues 

  

while the federal funds target rate was unchanged at a range of zero to 025 in 2011 the federal reserve took action during the middle of the year to lower longer term interest rates further declines in interest rates in 2011 have accelerated the prepayment activity in the company’s portfolios of residential mortgagebacked securities which resulted in higher premium amortization to the extent rates remain at these low levels the company’s net interest revenue will continue to be constrained even as growth in average balances helps to increase such revenue the low interest rate environment also affects asset management and administration fees the overall yields on certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds have remained at levels at or below the management fees on those funds the company continues to waive a portion of its management fees which it began in the first quarter of 2009 so that the funds can continue providing a positive return to clients these and other money market mutual funds may not be able to replace maturing securities with securities of equal or higher yields as a result the yields on such funds may remain around or decline from their current levels and therefore below the management fees on those funds to the extent this occurs the company may continue to waive fees and such waivers could increase from the fourth quarter 2011 level which would negatively affect asset management and administration fees 

  

the company recorded net impairment charges of 31 million and 36 million related to certain nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities in 2011 and 2010 respectively due to credit deterioration of the securities’ underlying loans further deterioration in the performance of the underlying loans in the company’s residential mortgagebacked securities portfolio could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges 

  

the company is pursuing lawsuits in state court in san francisco for rescission and damages against issuers underwriters and dealers of 51 individual nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities on which the company has experienced realized and unrealized losses the lawsuits allege that offering documents for the securities contained material untrue and misleading statements about the securities and the underwriting standards and credit quality of the underlying loans on january 27 2012 the court denied defendants’ motions to dismiss the claims with respect to all but 4 of the 51 securities and allowed the cases to proceed to discovery 

  

the “doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act” was signed into law in july 2010 among other things the legislation authorizes various assessments and fees and requires the establishment of minimum leverage and riskbased capital requirements for insured depository institutions the legislation also eliminated the office of thrift supervision effective july 21 2011 and as a result the federal reserve became csc’s primary regulator and the office of the comptroller of the currency became the primary regulator of schwab bank csc is continuing to review the impact the legislation studies and related rulemaking will have on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations

results of operations 

  

the following discussion presents an analysis of the company’s results of operations for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

  

net revenues 

  

the company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees net interest revenue and trading revenue which all increased in 2011 as compared to 2010 asset management and administration fees and trading revenue decreased while net interest revenue increased in 2010 as compared to 2009 

 

   

asset management and administration fees 

  

asset management and administration fees include mutual fund service fees and fees for other assetbased financial services provided to individual and institutional clients the company earns mutual fund service fees for shareholder services administration investment management and transfer agent services through july 2009 provided to its proprietary funds and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to thirdparty funds these fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds the company also earns asset management fees for advice solutions which include advisory and managed account services that are based on the daily balances of client assets subject to the specific fee for service the fair values of client assets included in proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data other asset management and administration fees include various asset based fees such as trust fees 401k record keeping fees and mutual fund clearing and other service fees asset management and administration fees may vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity for discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees see “current market and regulatory environment” 

  

asset management and administration fees increased by 106 million or 6 in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to an increase in advice solutions fees partially offset by a decrease in mutual fund service fees asset management and administration fees

the charles schwab corporation 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted 

  

decreased by 53 million or 3 in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to the decrease in mutual fund service fees partially offset by an increase in advice solutions fees 

  

given the low interest rate environment in 2011 2010 and 2009 the overall yields on certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds have remained at levels at or below the management fees on those funds as a result the company waived a portion of its fees in order to provide a positive return to clients mutual fund service fees decreased by 59 million or 5 in 2011 from 2010 and by 187 million or 14 in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to the increase in money market mutual fund fee waivers offset by higher average balances of client assets invested in the company’s mutual fund onesource funds as a result of continued asset inflows 

  

advice solutions fees increased by 138 million or 36 in 2011 from 2010 and by 106 million or 38 in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to higher average balances of client assets enrolled in retail advisory and managed account programs including schwab private client and schwab managed portfolios™ the increase in 2011 was also attributed to the integration of windhaven which was acquired in november 2010 additionally the increases in advice solutions fees were due to temporary fees rebates of 63 million and 68 million which reduced advice solutions fees in 2010 and 2009 respectively under a rebate program that ended in 2010 

  

net interest revenue 

  

net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on funding sources net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies the company’s investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall ie interestearning assets generally reprice more quickly than interestbearing liabilities when interest rates fall the company may attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lock in asset yields and by lowering rates paid to clients on interestbearing liabilities since the company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients as well as the rates charged on receivables from brokerage clients and also controls the composition of its investment securities it has some ability to manage its net interest spread the current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources however the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition for discussion of the impact of current market conditions on net interest revenue see “current market and regulatory environment” 

  

in clearing its clients’ trades schwab and optionsxpress inc hold cash balances payable to clients in most cases schwab and optionsxpress inc pay their clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment and in turn invest these funds and earn interest revenue receivables from brokerage clients consist primarily of margin loans to brokerage clients margin loans are loans made to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities pursuant to applicable regulations client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients which are recorded in cash and investments segregated on the company’s consolidated balance sheet when investing segregated client cash balances schwab and optionsxpress inc must adhere to applicable regulations that restrict investments to securities guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the us government participation certificates mortgagebacked securities guaranteed by the government national mortgage association certificates of deposit issued by us banks and thrifts and resale agreements collateralized by qualified securities additionally schwab and optionsxpress inc have established policies for the minimum credit quality and maximum maturity of these investments

the company’s interestearning assets are financed primarily by brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients noninterestbearing funding sources include noninterestbearing brokerage client cash balances and proceeds from stocklending activities as well as stockholders’equity 

  

the following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interestearning assets and funding sources on the consolidated balance sheet 

 

  

   

   

net interest revenue increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to higher average balances of interestearning assets partially offset by the effect of lower interest rate spreads resulting from higher amortization of premiums relating to residential mortgagebacked securities the growth in average balances of deposits from banking clients and payables to brokerage clients funded the increases in the balances of receivables from brokerage clients securities available for sale and securities held to maturity further declines in interest rates in 2011 accelerated the prepayment activity in the company’s portfolio of residential mortgagebacked securities which resulted in higher premium amortization 

  

net interest revenue increased in 2010 from 2009 due to higher average balances of interestearning assets this resulted from significant growth in the average balance of deposits from banking clients which in turn funded increases in the average balances of securities held to maturity securities available for sale and loans to banking clients these interestearning assets are invested at rates above the cost of supporting funding sources the increase in net interest revenue was partially offset by the decline in the yields of almost all interestearning assets compared to 2009

liquidity 

  

csc 

  

while csc is not currently subject to specific statutory capital requirements csc is required to serve as a source of strength for schwab bank and must have the ability to provide financial assistance if schwab bank experiences financial distress to manage capital adequacy the company currently utilizes a target tier 1 leverage ratio as defined by the board of governors of the federal reserve system of at least 6 at december 31 2011 the company’s tier 1 leverage ratio was 63 

  

csc’s liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries as well as cash provided by external financing csc has a universal automatic shelf registration statement shelf registration statement on file with the sec which enables csc to issue debt equity and other securities csc maintains excess liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and shortterm investments to cover daily funding needs and to support growth in the company’s business generally csc does not hold liquidity at its subsidiaries in excess of amounts deemed sufficient to support the subsidiaries’ operations including any regulatory capital requirements schwab schwab bank and optionsxpress inc are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with csc as further discussed below management believes that funds generated by the operations of csc’s subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting csc’s liquidity needs providing adequate liquidity to meet schwab bank’s capital guidelines and maintaining schwab and optionsxpress inc’s net capital 

  

in january 2012 the company completed an equity offering of 400000 shares of its preferred stock under the shelf registration statement for further discussion of the equity offering see “subsequent event” 

  

csc has liquidity needs that arise from the funding of cash dividends acquisitions and investments as well as its senior notes senior mediumterm notes series a mediumterm notes and junior subordinated notes the following are details of csc’s longterm debt 

 

  

   

csc has authorization from its board of directors to issue unsecured commercial paper notes commercial paper notes not to exceed 15 billion management has set a current limit for the commercial paper program of 800 million the maturities of the commercial paper notes may vary but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue the commercial paper is not redeemable prior to maturity and cannot be voluntarily prepaid the proceeds of the commercial paper program are to be used for general corporate purposes there were no borrowings of commercial paper notes outstanding at december 31 2011 csc’s ratings for these shortterm borrowings are p1 by moody’s a1 by standard  poor’s and f1 by fitch 

  

csc maintains an 800 million committed unsecured credit facility with a group of 11 banks which is scheduled to expire in june 2012 this facility replaced a similar facility that expired in june 2011 and was unused in 2011 the funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes including repayment of the commercial paper notes discussed above the financial covenants under this facility require schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio as defined schwab bank to be well capitalized as defined and csc to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity at december 31 2011 the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was 50 billion csc’s stockholders’ equity at december 31 2011 was 77 billion management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on csc’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements

schwab 

  

schwab is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of brokerdealers these regulations prohibit schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings from csc paying cash dividends or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5 of aggregate debit balances or less than 120 of its minimum dollar requirement of 250000 at december 31 2011 schwab’s net capital was 12 billion 10 of aggregate debit balances which was 948 million in excess of its minimum required net capital and 588 million in excess of 5 of aggregate debit balances

liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts which were 335 billion and 299 billion at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for schwab 

  

schwab has a finance lease obligation related to an office building and land under a 20year lease the remaining finance lease obligation of 100 million at december 31 2011 is being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term of 13 years 

  

to manage shortterm liquidity schwab maintains uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines with a group of six banks totaling 875 million at december 31 2011 the need for shortterm borrowings arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements scheduled liquidation of interestearnings investments and movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements schwab borrowed an average of 41 million per day for nine days in 2011 under these lines there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at december 31 2011

the company’s cash position reported as cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated balance sheet and cash flows are affected by changes in brokerage client cash balances and the associated amounts required to be segregated under regulatory guidelines timing differences between cash and investments actually segregated on a given date and the amount required to be segregated for that date may arise in the ordinary course of business and are addressed by the company in accordance with applicable regulations other factors which affect the company’s cash position and cash flows include investment activity in securities levels of capital expenditures acquisition and divestiture activity banking client deposit activity brokerage and banking client loan activity financing activity in longterm debt payments of dividends and repurchases and issuances of csc’s preferred and common stock the combination of these factors can cause significant fluctuations in the cash position during specific time periods

technology and operating risk 

  

technology and operating risk is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems that constrain the company’s ability to gather process and communicate information and process client transactions efficiently and securely without interruptions the company’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and the company’s success depends in part on its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its technology in anticipation of evolving client needs to the extent the company experiences system interruptions errors or downtime which could result from a variety of causes including changes in client use patterns technological failure changes to its systems linkages with thirdparty systems and power failures the company’s business and operations could be significantly negatively impacted to minimize business interruptions schwab has two data centers intended in part to further improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency the company is committed to an ongoing process of upgrading enhancing and testing its technology systems this effort is focused on meeting client needs meeting market and regulatory changes and deploying standardized technology platforms 

  

technology and operating risk also includes the risk of human error employee misconduct external fraud computer viruses distributed denial of service attacks terrorist attacks and natural disaster employee misconduct could include fraud and misappropriation of client or company assets improper use or disclosure of confidential client or company information and unauthorized activities such as transactions exceeding acceptable risks or authorized limits external fraud includes misappropriation of client or company assets by third parties including through unauthorized access to company systems and data and client accounts the frequency and sophistication of such fraud attempts continue to increase

despite the company’s risk management efforts it is not always possible to deter or prevent technological or operational failure or fraud or other misconduct and the precautions taken by the company may not be effective in all cases the company may be subject to litigation losses and regulatory actions in such cases and may be required to expend significant additional resources to remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures 

  

the company also faces technology and operating risk when it employs the services of various external vendors including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology processing servicing and support functions the company manages its exposure to external vendor risk through contractual provisions control standards and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance the company maintains policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with company data whether the data is internal company information employee information or nonpublic client information the company clearly defines for employees contractors and vendors the company’s expected standards of care for confidential data regular training is provided by the company in regard to data security 

  

the company is actively engaged in the research and development of new technologies services and products the company endeavors to protect its research and development efforts and its brands through the use of copyrights patents trade secrets and contracts 

  

credit risk 

  

credit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower counterparty or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations the company’s direct exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending activities securities lending activities mortgage lending activities its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities to manage the risks of such losses the company has established policies and procedures which include establishing and reviewing credit limits monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties and adjusting margin requirements for certain securities most of the company’s credit extensions are supported by collateral arrangements collateral arrangements relating to margin loans securities lending agreements and resale agreements include provisions that require additional collateral in the event that market fluctuations result in declines in the value of collateral received 

  

the company’s credit risk exposure related to loans to banking clients is actively managed through individual and portfolio reviews performed by management management regularly reviews asset quality including concentrations delinquencies nonaccrual loans chargeoffs and recoveries all are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for loan losses which is reviewed quarterly by senior management the company’s mortgage loan portfolios primarily include first lien residential real estate mortgage loans first mortgage of 56 billion and helocs of 35 billion at december 31 2011 

  

the company’s first mortgage portfolio underwriting requirements are generally consistent with the underwriting requirements in the secondary market for loan portfolios the company’s guidelines include maximum loantovalue ltv ratios cash out limits and minimum fair issac  company fico credit scores the specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan for example whether the property is a primary or secondary residence whether the loan is for investment property whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home and whether the loan is conforming or jumbo these credit underwriting standards have limited the exposure to the types of loans that experienced high foreclosures and loss rates elsewhere in the industry in recent years there have been no significant changes to the ltv ratio or fico credit score guidelines related to the company’s first mortgage or heloc portfolios during 2011 at december 31 2011 the weightedaverage originated ltv ratios were 60 and 59 for the first mortgage and heloc portfolios respectively the computation of the origination ltv ratio for a heloc includes any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of origination at december 31 2011 22 of helocs 755 million of the heloc portfolio were in a first lien position the weightedaverage originated fico credit scores were 766 and 768 for the first mortgage and heloc portfolios respectively 

  

the company does not offer loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a fico credit score of less than 620 at origination unless the borrower has compensating credit factors at december 31 2011 approximately 1 of both the first mortgage and heloc portfolios consisted of loans to borrowers with fico credit scores of less than 620

the following table presents certain of the company’s loan quality metrics as a percentage of total outstanding loans 

 

  

   

the company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale and securities held to maturity portfolios whose fair values totaled 340 billion and 155 billion at december 31 2011 respectively these portfolios include us agency and nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities certificates of deposit corporate debt securities us agency notes and assetbacked and other securities us agency residential mortgagebacked securities do not have explicit credit ratings however management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the us governmentsponsored enterprises included in nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities are securities collateralized by loans that are considered to be “prime” defined by the company as loans to borrowers with a fico credit score of 620 or higher at origination and “alta” defined by the company as prime loans with reduced documentation at origination 

  

residential mortgagebacked securities particularly alta securities experienced continued credit deterioration in 2011 including increased payment delinquency rates and losses on foreclosures of underlying mortgages for a discussion of the impact of current market conditions on residential mortgagebacked securities see “current market and regulatory environment” at december 31 2011 nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities consisted of 3 based on amortized cost of total residential mortgagebacked securities these securities were originated between 2003 and 2007 at december 31 2011 all of the corporate debt securities and nonmortgage assetbacked securities were rated investment grade defined as a rating equivalent to a moody’s rating of “baa” or higher or a standard  poor’s rating of “bbb” or higher

the company also has exposure to concentration risk from its margin and securities lending activities collateralized by securities of a single issuer or industry 

  

the company has indirect exposure to us government and agency securities held as collateral to secure its resale agreements the company’s primary credit exposure on these resale transactions is with its counterparty the company would have exposure to the us government and agency securities only in the event of the counterparty’s default on the resale agreements the fair value of us government and agency securities held as collateral for resale agreements totaled 183 billion at december 31 2011 

  

european holdings 

  

the company has exposure to nonsovereign financial institutions in europe the following table shows the amortized cost and fair values of cash equivalents cash segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes securities available for sale and securities held to maturity by each country in europe in which the issuer or counterparty is domiciled the company has no direct exposure to sovereign governments in europe the company does not have unfunded commitments to counterparties in europe nor does it have exposure as a result of credit default protection purchased or sold separately as of december 31 2011 

  

the determination of the domicile of exposure varies by the type of investment for time deposits and certificates of deposit the exposure is grouped in the country in which the financial institution is chartered under the regulatory framework of the european country for assetbacked commercial paper the exposure is grouped by the country of the sponsoring bank that provides the credit and liquidity support for such instruments for corporate debt securities the exposure is grouped by the country in which the issuer is domiciled in situations in which the company invests in a corporate debt security of a us subsidiary of a european parent company such holdings will be attributable to the european country only if significant reliance is placed on the european parent company for credit support underlying the security for substantially all of the holdings listed below the issuers or counterparties were financial institutions all of the company’s resale agreements which are included in investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes are collateralized by us government securities additionally the company’s securities lending activities are collateralized by cash therefore the company’s resale agreements and securities lending activities are not included in the table below even if the counterparty is a european institution

market risk is the potential for changes in revenue or the value of financial instruments held by the company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or market conditions for discussion of the company’s market risk see “item 7a – quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

  

fiduciary risk 

  

fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client fiduciary activities include but are not limited to individual and institutional trust investment management custody and cash and securities processing the company attempts to manage this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements business units have the

primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business guidance and control are provided through the creation approval and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees 

  

legal and regulatory risk 

  

the company faces significant legal and compliance risk in its business and the volume of litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed have been increasing among other things these risks relate to the suitability of client investments conflicts of interest disclosure obligations and performance expectations for company products and services supervision of employees and the adequacy of the company’s controls claims against the company may increase due to a variety of factors such as if clients suffer losses during a period of deteriorating equity market conditions as the company increases the level of advice it provides to clients and as the company enhances the services it provides to ias in addition the company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal state and foreign regulatory authorities and sros and such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex 

  

the company attempts to manage legal and compliance risk through policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid litigation claims and prevent or detect violations of applicable legal and regulatory requirements these procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics sales and trading practices marketing and communications extension of credit client funds and securities books and records antimoney laundering client privacy employment policies and contracts management despite the company’s efforts to maintain an effective compliance program and internal controls legal breaches and rule violations could result in reputational harm significant losses and disciplinary sanctions including limitations on the company’s business activities 

  

fair value of financial instruments 

  

the company uses fair value measurements to record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value and to determine fair value disclosures assets are measured at fair value using quoted prices or marketbased information and accordingly are classified as level 1 or level 2 measurements in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described in fair value measurement accounting guidance liabilities recorded at fair value were not material at december 31 2011 or 2010 see “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – 17 fair values of assets and liabilities” for more information on the company’s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 

  

when available the company uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities when quoted prices do not exist the company uses prices obtained from independent thirdparty pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets the company validates prices received from the pricing services using various methods including comparison to prices received from additional pricing services comparison to quoted market prices where available comparison to internal valuation models and review of other relevant market data the company does not adjust the prices received from independent thirdparty pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts at december 31 2011 and 2010 the company did not adjust prices received from independent thirdparty pricing services 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

the consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us while the majority of the company’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are not based on estimates there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position and reported financial results these critical accounting estimates are described below management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the company’s financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy

otherthantemporary impairment of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity  management evaluates whether securities available for sale and securities held to maturity are otherthantemporarily impaired otti on a quarterly basis debt securities with unrealized losses are considered otti if the company intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such security prior to any anticipated recovery if management determines that a security is otti under these circumstances the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between the amortized cost and the thencurrent fair value 

  

a security is also otti if management does not expect to recover the amortized cost of the security in this circumstance management utilizes cash flow models to estimate the expected future cash flow from the securities and to estimate the credit loss the impairment recognized in earnings is measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security expected cash flows are discounted using the security’s effective interest rate 

  

the evaluation of whether the company expects to recover the amortized cost of a security is inherently judgmental the evaluation includes the assessment of several bond performance indicators including the portion of the underlying loans that are delinquent 30 days 60 days 90 days in bankruptcy in foreclosure or converted to real estate owned the actual amount of loss incurred on the underlying loans in which the property has been foreclosed and sold the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security available to absorb credit losses on the underlying loans the current price and magnitude of the unrealized loss and whether the company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments management uses cash flow models to further assess the likelihood of otherthantemporary impairment for the company’s nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities to develop the cash flow models the company uses forecasted loss severity prepayment speeds ie the rate at which the principal on underlying loans are paid down and default rates over the securities’ expected remaining maturities 

  

valuation of goodwill  the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever indications of impairment exist an impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value resulting in an impairment charge for this excess 

  

the company has elected april 1 st as its annual goodwill impairment testing date in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on april 1 2011 management estimated the fair value of each of the company’s reporting units generally defined as the company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management and compared this value to the carrying value of the reporting unit the estimated fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value and therefore management concluded that no amount of goodwill was impaired the estimated fair value of the reporting units was established using a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit adverse changes in the company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition a loss of key personnel the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the company’s recorded goodwill 

  

allowance for loan losses the adequacy of the allowance is reviewed quarterly by management taking into consideration current economic conditions the existing loan portfolio composition past loss experience and risks inherent in the portfolio 

  

the process to establish an allowance for loan losses utilizes loanlevel statistical models that estimate prepayments defaults and probable losses for the loan segments based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the segments the methodology considers the effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including but not limited to interest rates housing price movements as measured by a housing price index economic conditions estimated defaults and foreclosures measured by historical and expected delinquencies changes in prepayment speeds loantovalue ratios past loss experience estimates of future loss severities borrower credit risk measured by fico scores and the adequacy of collateral the methodology also evaluates concentrations in the loan segments including loan products year of origination geographical distribution of collateral and the portion of borrowers who have other client relationships with the company 

  

the more significant variables considered include a measure of delinquency roll rates loss severity housing prices and interest rates delinquency roll rates ie the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result

in a loss are estimated from the company’s historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information loss severity estimates are based on the company’s historical loss experience and market trends housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values factors affecting the home price index include housing inventory unemployment interest rates and inflation expectations interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths this quarterly analysis results in a loss factor that is applied to the outstanding balances to determine the allowance for loan loss for each loan segment 

  

legal reserve  reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter after considering among other factors the progress of the case prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases available defenses insurance coverage and indemnification and the opinions and views of legal counsel in many cases including most class action lawsuits it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred or to estimate the range of that loss until the matter is close to resolution in which case no accrual is made until that time reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

market risk is the potential for changes in revenue or the value of financial instruments held by the company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or market conditions 

  

for the company’s market risk related to interest rates a sensitivity analysis referred to as a net interest revenue simulation model is shown below the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on its interestearning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources that finance these assets 

  

net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets include residential real estate loans and mortgagebacked securities these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and to changes to prepayment levels which tend to increase in a declining rate environment 

  

to mitigate the risk of loss the company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interestearning assets and funding sources to remain within these guidelines the company manages the maturity repricing and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios because the company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients the rates charged on margin loans and controls the composition of its investment securities it has some ability to manage its net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions 

  

the company is also subject to market risk as a result of fluctuations in equity prices the company’s direct holdings of equity securities and its associated exposure to equity prices are not material the company is indirectly exposed to equity market fluctuations in connection with securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers and customer securities loaned out as part of the company’s securities lending activities equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity margin borrowing and overall client engagement with the company additionally the company earns mutual fund service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the company 

  

financial instruments held by the company are also subject to liquidity risk – that is the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument recent conditions in the credit markets have significantly reduced market liquidity in a wide range of financial instruments including the types of instruments held by the company and fair value can differ significantly from the value implied by the credit quality and actual performance of the instrument’s underlying cash flows 

  

financial instruments held by the company are also subject to valuation risk as a result of changes in valuations of the underlying collateral such as housing prices in the case of residential real estate loans and mortgagebacked securities 

  

for discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees net interest revenue and securities available for sale see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – current market and regulatory environment” 

  

the company’s market risk related to financial instruments held for trading and forward sale and interest rate lock commitments related to its loans held for sale portfolio is not material 

  

net interest revenue simulation 

  

the company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulation model the model includes all interestsensitive assets and liabilities key variables in the model include the repricing of financial instruments prepayment reinvestment and product pricing assumptions the company uses constant balances and market rates in the model assumptions in order to minimize the number of variables and to better isolate risks the simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and as a result cannot precisely estimate net interest

revenue or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies including changes in asset and liability mix 

  

as represented by the simulations presented below the company’s investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall ie interestearning assets generally reprice more quickly than interestbearing liabilities 

  

the simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as the company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood the company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the results of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to the company’s current market rates forecast on simulated net interest revenue over the next 12 months beginning december 31 2011 and 2010 

 

   

the sensitivities shown in the simulation reflect the fact that shortterm interest rates in 2011 remained at historically low levels including the federal funds target rate which was unchanged at a range of zero to 025 the current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources in a declining interest rate scenario a decline in interest rates could therefore negatively impact the yield on the company’s investment portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense further compressing net interest margin any increases in shortterm interest rates result in a greater impact as yields on interestearning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources

regulation 

  

csc is a savings and loan holding company and schwab bank csc’s depository institution subsidiary is a federal savings bank csc and schwab bank are both currently subject to supervision and regulation by the office of thrift supervision however the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act legislation eliminates the office of thrift supervision and transfers its functions to other federal banking agencies effective july 21 2011 unless extended or delayed for up to an additional six months as a result the federal reserve will become csc’s primary regulator and the office of the comptroller of the currency will become the primary regulator of schwab bank as a savings and loan holding company csc is not subject to specific statutory capital requirements however csc is required to maintain capital that is sufficient to support the holding company and its subsidiaries’ business activities and the risks inherent in those activities 

  

schwab bank is subject to regulation and supervision and to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state laws including regulatory capital guidelines among other things these requirements govern transactions with csc and its nondepository institution subsidiaries including loans and other extensions of credit investments or asset purchases dividends and investments the federal banking agencies have broad powers to enforce these regulations including the power to terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver schwab bank is required to maintain minimum capital levels as specified in federal banking laws and regulations failure to meet the minimum levels will result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on schwab bank 

  

the securities industry in the united states is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws schwab is registered as a brokerdealer with the united states securities and exchange commission sec the fifty states and the district of columbia and puerto rico schwab and csim are registered as investment advisors with the sec additionally schwab is regulated by the commodities futures trading commission cftc with respect to the futures and commodities trading activities it conducts as an introducing broker

the charles schwab corporation 

  

as a registered brokerdealer schwab is subject to rule 15c31 under the securities exchange act of 1934 the uniform net capital rule and related sro requirements the cftc and nfa also impose net capital requirements the uniform net capital rule specifies minimum capital requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of brokerdealers because csc itself is not a registered brokerdealer it is not subject to the uniform net capital rule however if schwab failed to maintain specified levels of net capital such failure would constitute a default by csc under certain debt covenants 

  

the uniform net capital rule limits brokerdealers’ ability to transfer capital to parent companies and other affiliates compliance with the uniform net capital rule could limit schwab’s operations and its ability to repay subordinated debt to csc which in turn could limit csc’s ability to repay debt pay cash dividends and purchase shares of its outstanding stock

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

the company faces a variety of risks that may affect its operations or financial results and many of those risks are driven by factors that the company cannot control or predict the following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant although there may be other risks that could arise or may prove to be more significant than expected that may affect the company’s operations or financial results

developments in the business economic and geopolitical environment could negatively impact the company’s business 

  

the company’s business can be adversely affected by the general environment – economic corporate securities market regulatory and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations trading activity interest rates and overall investor engagement and are outside of the company’s control deterioration in the housing and credit markets reductions in shortterm interest rates and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact the company’s net interest revenue asset management and administration fees and capital resources 

  

a significant decrease in the company’s liquidity could negatively affect the company’s business and financial management as well as reduce client confidence in the company 

  

maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to the business operations of the company including margin lending mortgage lending and transaction settlement among other liquidity needs the company meets its liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by client activity and operating earnings as well as cash provided by external financing fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances as well as changes in market conditions may affect the company’s ability to meet its liquidity needs a reduction in the company’s liquidity position could reduce client confidence in the company which could result in the loss of client accounts in addition if the company’s brokerdealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to csc which could reduce csc’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt and pay cash dividends in addition csc may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries 

  

factors which may adversely affect the company’s liquidity position include a reduction in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts a dramatic increase in the company’s client lending activities including margin and personal lending unanticipated outflows of company cash increased capital requirements other regulatory changes or a loss of market or customer confidence in the company schwab may also experience temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between clients’ transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances 

  

when cash generated by client activity and operating earnings is not sufficient for the company’s liquidity needs the company must seek external financing during periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets potential sources of external financing could be reduced and borrowing costs could increase although csc and schwab maintain committed and uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines and csc has a commercial paper issuance program as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions and disruptions in the credit markets in addition a significant downgrade in the company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets 

  

the company may suffer significant losses from its credit exposures 

  

the company’s businesses are subject to the risk that a client counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate while the company has policies and procedures designed to manage this risk the policies and procedures may not be fully effective the company’s exposure mainly results from margin lending activities securities lending activities mortgage lending activities its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds that the company sponsors 

  

the company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale and securities held to maturity portfolios which includes us agency and nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities consumer loan assetbacked securities corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit among other investments these instruments are also subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial market’s assessment of issuer credit quality increases in the unemployment rate delinquency and default rates housing price declines changes in prevailing interest rates and other economic factors 

  

loss of value of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity can result in charges if management determines that the impairments are other than temporary the evaluation of whether otherthantemporary impairment exists is a matter 

  

 7  

the charles schwab corporation 

  

of judgment which includes the assessment of several factors see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting estimates” if management determines that a security is otherthantemporarily impaired the cost basis of the security may be adjusted and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings certain securities available for sale experienced continued deteriorating credit characteristics in 2010 which resulted in impairment charges deterioration in the performance of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity could result in the recognition of future impairment charges 

  

the company’s loans to banking clients primarily consist of firstlien mortgage loans and helocs increases in delinquency and default rates housing price declines increases in the unemployment rate and other economic factors can result in charges for loan loss reserves and write downs on such loans 

  

heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments concentration risk can increase the company’s risk of loss examples of the company’s credit concentration risk include 

  

   

   

   

the company may also be subject to concentration risk when lending to a particular counterparty borrower or issuer 

  

the company sponsors a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds although the company has no obligation to do so the company may decide for competitive reasons to provide credit liquidity or other support to its funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity such support could cause the company to take significant charges and could reduce the company’s liquidity if the company chose not to provide credit liquidity or other support in such a situation the company could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected 

  

significant interest rate changes could affect the company’s profitability and financial condition 

  

the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interestearning assets such as cash equivalents short and longterm investments and mortgage and margin loans relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources including deposits in banking and brokerage accounts shortterm borrowings and longterm debt changes in interest rates generally affect the interest earned on interestearning assets differently than the interest the company pays on its interestbearing liabilities in addition certain funding sources do not bear interest and their cost therefore does not vary overall the company is positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment the company could be adversely affected by a decline in interest rates if the rates that the company earns on interestearning assets decline more than the rates that the company pays on its funding sources or if prepayment rates increase on the mortgages and mortgagebacked securities that the company holds with the low interest rate environment the company’s revenue from interestearning assets has been declining more than the rates that the company pays on its funding sources the company may also be limited in the amount it can reduce interest rates on deposit accounts and still offer a competitive return 

  

to the extent the overall yield on certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds falls to a level at or below the management fees on those funds the company may waive a portion of its fee in order to continue providing some return to clients as a result of the low interest rate environment the company has been waiving and may continue to waive a portion of its management fees for certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds such fee waivers negatively impact the company’s asset management and administration fees 

  

the company is subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not always be successful in defending itself against such claims or proceedings 

  

the financial services industry faces substantial litigation and regulatory risks the company is subject to arbitration claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business as well as class actions and other significant litigation the company is also the subject of inquiries investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies actions brought against the company may result in settlements awards injunctions fines penalties or other results adverse to the company

including reputational harm even if the company is successful in defending against these actions the defense of such matters may result in the company incurring significant expenses predicting the outcome of matters is inherently difficult particularly where claims are brought on behalf of various classes of claimants claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages or when investigations or legal proceedings are at an early stage a substantial judgment settlement fine or penalty could be material to the company’s operating results or cash flows for a particular future period depending on the company’s results for that period in market downturns the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased see “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – note to consolidated financial statements – 14 commitments and contingent liabilities” 

  

from time to time the company is subject to litigation claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights eg patents such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources if the company was found to have infringed a thirdparty patent or other intellectual property rights it could incur substantial liability and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology or providing certain products or services 

  

extensive regulation of the company’s businesses limits the company’s activities and may subject it to significant penalties 

  

as a participant in the securities banking and financial services industries the company is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws by governmental agencies supervisory authorities and sros such regulation is expected to become more extensive and complex in response to the recent market disruptions the requirements imposed by the company’s regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets the safety and soundness of financial institutions and the protection of clients these regulations often serve to limit the company’s activities by way of capital customer protection and market conduct requirements and restrictions on the businesses activities that the company may conduct despite the company’s efforts to comply with applicable regulations there are a number of risks particularly in areas where applicable regulations may be unclear or where regulators revise their previous guidance any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by the company’s regulators against the company or its affiliates officers or employees could result in fines penalties cease and desist orders enforcement actions suspension or expulsion or other disciplinary sanctions including limitations on the company’s business activities any of which could harm the company’s reputation and adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively impact the company’s business and financial results 

  

new legislation rule changes or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal state and sro rules and regulations may directly affect the operation and profitability of the company or its specific business lines the profitability of the company could also be affected by rules and regulations which impact the business and financial communities generally including changes to the laws governing taxation electronic commerce client privacy and security of client data in addition the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business the company conducts modifications to the company’s business practices increased capital requirements or additional costs

the “doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act” was signed into law in july 2010 this legislation makes extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and requires significant rulemaking in addition the legislation mandates multiple studies which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action csc continues to review the impact that the legislation studies and related rulemaking will have on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the legislation charges the federal reserve with drafting enhanced regulatory requirements for “systemically important” bank holding companies and certain other nonbank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” by the financial stability oversight council which may include csc the enhanced requirements include more stringent capital leverage and liquidity standards the legislation permits the federal reserve to tailor its enhanced requirements to the perceived risk profile of an individual financial institution among other things the legislation authorizes various assessments and fees requires the

the charles schwab corporation 

  

establishment of minimum leverage and riskbased capital requirements for insured depository institutions and requires the sec to complete studies and develop rules regarding various investor protection issues 

  

the legislation also establishes a new independent consumer financial protection bureau which will have broad rulemaking supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer products including mortgages homeequity loans and credit cards states will be permitted to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and state attorney generals can enforce consumer protection rules issued by the bureau 

  

the legislation gives the sec discretion to adopt rules regarding standards of conduct for brokerdealers providing investment advice to retail customers the various studies required by the legislation could result in additional rulemaking or legislative action which could impact our business and financial results 

  

the changes resulting from the legislation may impact the profitability of the company’s business activities require changes to certain of its business practices impose upon the company more stringent capital liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect the company’s business these changes may also require the company to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes

the company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees net interest revenue and trading revenue the company generates asset management and administration fees through its proprietary and thirdparty mutual fund offerings as well as feebased investment management and advisory services net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on funding sources asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue are impacted by securities valuations interest rates the company’s ability to attract new clients and client activity levels the company generates trading revenue through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenue from trading activity in fixed income securities trading revenue is impacted by trading volumes the volatility of prices in the equity and fixed income markets and commission rates 

  

2010 compared to 2009 

  

the equity markets improved during 2010 and remained well above their prior year lows the nasdaq composite index the standard  poor’s 500 index and the dow jones industrial average increased 17 13 and 11 respectively the threemonth libor increased by 5 basis points to 30 in 2010 however the low interest rate environment continued throughout the year as the federal funds target rate remained unchanged during the year at a range of zero to 025 

  

the company’s sustained investment in expanding and improving product and service capabilities for its clients was reflected in the strength of its key client activity metrics in 2010 – net new client assets totaled 781 billion excluding outflows related to a single mutual fund clearing client who completed a planned transfer to an internal platform during the year and total client assets ended 2010 at a record 157 trillion up 11 from 2009 client trading activity slowed during the year as clients’ daily average trades decreased 4 from 2009 to 399700 

  

net revenues were relatively flat in 2010 from 2009 however the company experienced a change in the mix of its revenue sources as the increase in net interest revenue was offset by decreases in trading revenue asset management and administration fees and other revenue net interest revenue increased due to higher average balances of interestearning assets partially offset by a decrease in the average yield earned trading revenue decreased due to lower average revenue per revenue trade resulting from improved online trade pricing for clients which was implemented in january 2010 and slightly lower daily average revenue trades in 2010 while the low interest rate environment caused over 200 million of additional money market mutual fund fee waivers from the prior year the decrease in asset management and administration fees was limited to 3 due to higher average asset valuations and continued asset inflows other revenue was lower in comparison to 2009 due to a gain of 31 million on the repurchase of a portion of the company’s longterm debt in 2009 

  

expenses excluding interest increased by 19 in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to the recognition of certain significant charges in 2010 the company recognized class action litigation and regulatory reserves and other costs totaling 320 million relating to the schwab yieldplus fund ®  additionally the company decided to cover the net remaining losses recognized by schwab money market mutual funds as a result of their investments in a single structured investment vehicle that defaulted in 2008 and recorded a charge of 132 million in 2010 also as a result of challenging credit card industry economics the company ended its sponsorship in its invest first ® and worldpoints a visa b credit cards and recorded a charge of 30 million the company’s ongoing expense discipline helped limit the growth in all other expense categories in the aggregate to 3 over the prior year 

  

2009 compared to 2008 

  

economic and market conditions were challenging throughout 2009 marked by unprecedented market dynamics including declines in shortterm interest rates and home valuations increases in home foreclosures and delinquencies and tight credit markets while the federal funds target rate was unchanged at a range of zero to 025 the threemonth libor decreased by 158 basis points to 025 at the same time although the equity markets showed sustained improvement from their march

net revenues decreased by 19 in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to the decreases in asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue asset management and administration fees decreased in 2009 primarily due to money market mutual fund fee waivers of 224 million and lower average equity market valuations there were no money market mutual fund fee waivers in 2008 net interest revenue decreased as a result of the low interest rate environment partially offset by higher average balances of interestearning assets these decreases were offset by the increase in other revenue other revenue in 2009 included a 31 million gain on the repurchase of a portion of the company’s longterm debt in addition other revenue in 2008 included a loss of 29 million on the sale of a corporate debt security held in the company’s available for sale portfolio net revenues were also negatively impacted by net impairment charges of 60 million in 2009 relating to certain residential mortgagebacked securities in the company’s available for sale portfolio net impairment losses on securities in 2008 included an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 44 million related to a corporate debt security held in the company’s available for sale portfolio 

  

expenses excluding interest decreased by 7 in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to the decreases in compensation and benefits professional services and advertising and market development expenses the decrease in expenses was partially offset by severance and facilities charges of 101 million relating to the company’s cost reduction measures and a 16 million fdic special industry assessment 

  

as a result of the company’s cost reduction measures and expense discipline the company achieved a pretax profit margin from continuing operations of 304 and return on stockholders’ equity of 17 in 2009 net revenue per average fulltime equivalent employee was 338000 in 2009 down 12 from 2008 due to lower net revenues partially offset by the decrease in average fulltime equivalent employees

current market and regulatory environment 

  

while the equity markets improved from their march 2009 lows which helped to strengthen the company’s net revenues in 2010 the interest rate environment remains challenging and may continue to constrain the company’s net revenues 

  

shortterm interest rates remained at historically low levels in 2010 as the federal funds target rate was unchanged at a range of zero to 025 and the threemonth and sixmonth libor were below yearearlier levels for the majority of the year to the extent rates remain at these low levels the company’s net interest revenue will continue to be constrained the low rate environment also affects asset management and administration fees the overall yields on certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds have fallen to levels at or below the management fees the company earns on those funds the company continues to waive a portion of its management fees which it began to do in the first quarter of 2009 so that the funds may continue providing a positive return to clients these and other money market mutual funds may continue to find it necessary

to replace maturing securities with low yielding securities and the overall yield on such funds may remain below the management fees on those funds to the extent this occurs fees may continue to be waived and could increase from the fourth quarter 2010 level which would negatively affect asset management and administration fees 

  

the company recorded net impairment charges of 36 million and 60 million related to certain nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities in 2010 and 2009 respectively due to credit deterioration of the securities’ underlying collateral further deterioration in the performance of the underlying loans in the company’s residential mortgagebacked securities portfolio could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges 

  

the “doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act” was signed into law in july 2010 among other things the legislation authorizes various assessments and fees and requires the establishment of minimum leverage and riskbased capital requirements for insured depository institutions csc is continuing to review the impact the legislation studies and related rulemaking will have on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations

asset management and administration fees 

  

asset management and administration fees include mutual fund service fees and fees for other assetbased financial services provided to individual and institutional clients the company earns mutual fund service fees for shareholder services administration investment management and transfer agent services through july 2009 provided to its proprietary funds and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to thirdparty funds these fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in the company’s proprietary funds and thirdparty funds the company also earns asset management fees for advisory and managed account services which are based on the daily balances of client assets subject to the specific fee for service the fair values of client assets included in proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data asset management and administration fees may vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity for discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees see “current market and regulatory environment” 

  

asset management and administration fees decreased by 53 million or 3 in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to the decrease in mutual fund service fees partially offset by an increase in investment management and trust fees asset management and administration fees decreased by 480 million or 20 in 2009 from 2008 due to decreases in mutual fund service fees and investment management and trust fees 

  

   

mutual fund service fees decreased by 169 million or 11 in 2010 from 2009 and by 414 million or 22 in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to money market mutual fund fee waivers given the low interest rate environment in 2010 and 2009 the overall yields on certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds have fallen to levels at or below the management fees on those funds as a result the company waived a portion of its fees in 2010 and 2009 in order to provide a positive return to clients there were no money market mutual fund fee waivers in 2008 the decrease in mutual fund service fees in 2010 was partially offset by the effect of higher average balances of client assets invested in the company’s mutual fund onesource funds as a result of higher average asset valuations and continued asset inflows the decrease in mutual fund service fees in 2009 was also due to lower average balances of client assets invested in the company’s mutual fund onesource funds and mutual fund clearing services as a result of lower average equity market valuations 

  

investment management and trust fees increased by 104 million or 38 in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to higher average balances of client assets participating in advisory and managed account services programs this increase was partially offset by temporary fees rebates of 63 million offered to qualifying clients that participated in those programs investment management and trust fees decreased by 67 million or 20 in 2009 from 2008 due to temporary fee rebates relating to the same programs discussed previously 

  

net interest revenue 

  

net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on funding sources net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies the company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall ie interestearning assets generally reprice more quickly than interestbearing liabilities when interest rates fall the company may attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lockin asset yields as well as by lowering rates paid to clients on interestbearing liabilities since the company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients as well as the rates charged on receivables from brokerage clients and also controls the composition of its investment securities it has

the following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interestearning assets and funding sources on the consolidated balance sheet 

  

  

     

net interest revenue increased in 2010 from 2009 due to higher average balances of interestearning assets this resulted from significant growth in the average balance of deposits from banking clients which in turn funded increases in the average balances of securities held to maturity securities available for sale and loans to banking clients these interestearning assets are invested at rates above the cost of supporting funding sources the increase in net interest revenue was partially offset by the low interest rate environment that persisted in 2010 which resulted in the decline in the yields of almost all interestearning assets compared to 2009 

  

net interest revenue decreased in 2009 from 2008 due to the low interest rate environment in 2009 as a result the company experienced declines in the yields and rates of all interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities compared to 2008 with yields on interestearning assets declining more than the cost of funding sources as shortterm interest rates approached zero the mix of interestearning assets also negatively affected net interest revenue – most notably the decrease in the average balance of margin loans resulted in a higher average balance of cash and investments segregated a lower yielding asset category the effect of the low interest rate environment and asset mix was partially offset by the growth in average balances the company experienced significant growth in deposits from banking clients which in turn funded increases in the average balances of securities available for sale loans to banking clients and cash and cash equivalents

csc maintains an 800 million committed unsecured credit facility with a group of twelve banks which is scheduled to expire in june 2011 this facility replaced a similar facility that expired in june 2010 these facilities were unused in 2010 the funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes including repayment of the commercial paper notes discussed above the financial covenants under this facility require schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio as defined schwab bank to be well capitalized as defined and csc to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity at december 31 2010 the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was 44 billion management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on csc’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements 

  

csc also has direct access to 704 million of the 829 million uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines discussed below that are primarily utilized by schwab to manage shortterm liquidity these lines were not used in 2010 

  

in addition schwab provides csc with a 10 billion credit facility maturing in december 2011 no funds were drawn under this facility at december 31 2010 

  

schwab 

  

schwab is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of brokerdealers these regulations prohibit schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings from csc paying cash dividends or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in net capital of less than 5 of aggregate debit balances or less than 120 of its minimum dollar requirement of 250000 at december 31 2010 schwab’s net capital was 12 billion 9 of aggregate debit balances which was 930 million in excess of its minimum required net capital and 553 million in excess of 5 of aggregate debit balances 

  

most of schwab’s assets are readily convertible to cash consisting primarily of shortterm ie less than 150 days investmentgrade interestearning investments the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements receivables from brokerage clients and receivables from brokers dealers and clearing organizations client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities receivables from and payables to brokers dealers and clearing organizations primarily represent current open transactions which usually settle or can be closed out within a few business days 

  

liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts which were 299 billion and 253 billion at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for schwab in the future 

  

schwab has a finance lease obligation related to an office building and land under a 20year lease the remaining finance lease obligation of 106 million at december 31 2010 is being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term of 14 years 

  

to manage shortterm liquidity schwab maintains uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines with a group of seven banks totaling 829 million at december 31 2010 the need for shortterm borrowings arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements scheduled liquidation of interestearnings investments and movements of cash to meet

schwab bank 

  

schwab bank is required to maintain minimum capital levels as specified in federal banking laws and regulations failure to meet the minimum levels will result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on schwab bank based on its regulatory capital ratios at december 31 2010 schwab bank is considered well capitalized schwab bank’s regulatory capital and ratios at december 31 2010 are as follows

the company’s cash position reported as cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated balance sheet and cash flows are affected by changes in brokerage client cash balances and the associated amounts required to be segregated under regulatory guidelines timing differences between cash and investments actually segregated on a given date and the amount required to be segregated for that date may arise in the ordinary course of business and are addressed by the company in accordance with applicable regulations other factors which affect the company’s cash position and cash flows include investment activity in securities levels of capital expenditures acquisition and divestiture activity banking client deposit activity brokerage and banking client loan activity financing activity in longterm debt payments of dividends and repurchases and issuances of csc’s common stock the combination of these factors can cause significant fluctuations in the cash position during specific time periods

credit risk 

  

credit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower counterparty or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations the company’s direct exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending activities securities lending activities mortgage lending activities its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds that the company sponsors to manage the risks of such losses the company has established policies and procedures which include establishing and reviewing credit limits monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties and adjusting margin requirements for certain securities most of the company’s credit extensions are supported by collateral arrangements collateral arrangements relating to margin loans securities lending agreements and resale agreements include provisions that require additional collateral in the event that market fluctuations result in declines in the value of collateral received 

  

the company’s credit risk exposure related to loans to banking clients is actively managed through individual and portfolio reviews performed by management management regularly reviews asset quality including concentrations delinquencies nonperforming loans losses and recoveries all are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for loan losses which is reviewed quarterly by senior management the company’s mortgage loan portfolios primarily include first lien residential mortgage loans first mortgage portfolio of 47 billion and home equity lines of credit heloc portfolio of 35 billion at december 31 2010 

  

the company’s first mortgage portfolio underwriting requirements are generally consistent with the underwriting requirements in the secondary market for loan portfolios the company’s guidelines include maximum loantovalue ltv ratios cash out limits and minimum fair issac  company fico credit scores the specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan for example whether the property is a primary or secondary residence whether the loan is for investment property whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home and whether the loan is conforming or jumbo these credit underwriting standards have limited the exposure to the types of loans that experienced high foreclosures and loss rates elsewhere in the industry during 2010 and 2009 there have been no significant changes to the ltv ratio or fico credit score guidelines related to the company’s first mortgage or heloc portfolios during 2010 at december 31 2010 the weightedaverage originated ltv ratios were 60 and 59 for the first mortgage and heloc portfolios respectively the computation of the origination ltv ratio for a heloc includes any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of origination at december 31 2010 21 of helocs 742 million of the heloc portfolio were in a first lien position the weightedaverage originated fico credit scores were 764 and 768 for the first mortgage and heloc portfolios respectively at december 31 2010

fiduciary risk 

  

fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client fiduciary activities include but are not limited to individual and institutional trust investment management custody and cash and securities processing the company attempts to manage this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business guidance and control are provided through the creation approval and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees 

  

legal and regulatory risk 

  

the company faces significant legal and compliance risk in its business and the volume of litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed have been increasing among other things these risks relate to the suitability of client investments conflicts of interest disclosure obligations and performance expectations for company products and services supervision of employees and the adequacy of the company’s controls claims against the company may increase due to a variety of factors such as if clients suffer losses during a period of deteriorating equity market conditions as the company increases the level of advice it provides to clients and as the company enhances the services it provides to ias in addition the company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal state and foreign regulatory authorities and sros and such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex 

  

the company attempts to manage legal and compliance risk through policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid litigation claims and prevent or detect violations of applicable legal and regulatory requirements these procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics sales and trading practices marketing and communications extension of credit client funds and securities books and records antimoney laundering client privacy employment policies and contracts management despite the company’s efforts to maintain an effective compliance program and internal controls legal breaches and rule violations could result in reputational harm significant losses and disciplinary sanctions including limitations on the company’s business activities 

  

fair value of financial instruments 

  

the company uses fair value measurements to record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value and to determine fair value disclosures all of these assets were measured at fair value using quoted prices or marketbased information and accordingly were classified as level 1 or level 2 measurements in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described in fair value measurement accounting guidance liabilities recorded at fair value were not material at december 31 2010 or 2009 see “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – 16 fair values of assets and liabilities” for more information on the company’s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value

critical accounting estimates 

  

the consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us while the majority of the company’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are not based on estimates there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position and reported financial results these critical accounting estimates are described below management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the company’s financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy 

  

otherthantemporary impairment of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity  management evaluates whether securities available for sale and securities held to maturity are otherthantemporarily impaired otti on a quarterly basis debt securities with unrealized losses are considered otti if the company intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such security prior to any anticipated recovery if management determines that a security is otti under these circumstances the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between the amortized cost and the thencurrent fair value 

  

a security is also otti if management does not expect to recover the amortized cost of the security in this circumstance management utilizes cash flow models to estimate the expected future cash flow from the securities and to estimate the credit loss the impairment recognized in earnings is measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security expected cash flows are discounted using the security’s effective interest rate 

  

the evaluation of whether the company expects to recover the amortized cost of a security is inherently judgmental the evaluation includes the assessment of several bond performance indicators including the portion of the underlying loans that are delinquent 30 days 60 days 90 days in bankruptcy in foreclosure or converted to real estate owned the actual amount of loss incurred on the underlying loans in which the property has been foreclosed and sold the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security available to absorb credit losses on the underlying loans the current credit ratings issued by either standard  poor’s fitch ratings or moody’s the current price and magnitude of the unrealized loss and whether the company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments management uses cash flow models to further assess the likelihood of otherthantemporary impairment for the company’s nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities to develop the cash flow models the company uses forecasted loss severity prepayment speeds ie the rate at which the principal on underlying loans are paid down and default rates over the securities’ expected remaining maturities 

  

valuation of goodwill  the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever indications of impairment exist an impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value resulting in an impairment charge for this excess 

  

the company has elected april 1 st as its annual goodwill impairment testing date in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on april 1 2010 management estimated the fair value of each of the company’s reporting units generally defined as the company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management and compared this value to the carrying value of the reporting unit the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and therefore management concluded that no amount of goodwill was impaired the estimated fair value of the reporting units was established using a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit adverse changes in the company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition a loss of key personnel the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the company’s recorded goodwill 

  

allowance for loan losses the adequacy of the allowance is reviewed quarterly by management taking into consideration current economic conditions the existing loan portfolio composition past loss experience and risks inherent in the portfolio 

  

the process to establish an allowance for loan losses utilizes loanlevel statistical models that estimate prepayments defaults and probable losses for the loan portfolios based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the portfolios the

methodology considers the effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including but not limited to interest rates housing price movements as measured by a housing price index economic conditions estimated defaults and foreclosures measured by historical and expected delinquencies changes in prepayment speeds loantovalue ratios past loss experience estimates of future loss severities borrower credit risk measured by fico scores and the adequacy of collateral the methodology also evaluates concentrations in the loan portfolios including loan products year of origination geographical distribution of collateral and the portion of borrowers who have other client relationships with the company 

  

the more significant variables considered include a measure of delinquency roll rates loss severity housing prices and interest rates delinquency roll rates ie the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result in a loss are estimated from the company’s historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information loss severity estimates are based on the company’s historical loss experience and market trends housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values factors affecting the home price index include housing inventory unemployment interest rates and inflation expectations interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths this quarterly analysis results in a loss factor that is applied to the outstanding balances to determine the allowance for loan loss for each loan segment 

  

legal reserve  reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter after considering among other factors the progress of the case prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases available defenses insurance coverage and indemnification and the opinions and views of legal counsel in many cases including most class action lawsuits it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred or to estimate the range of that loss until the matter is close to resolution in which case no accrual is made until that time reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved 

  

the company’s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee additionally management has reviewed with the audit committee the company’s significant estimates discussed in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

market risk is the potential for changes in revenue or the value of financial instruments held by the company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or market conditions 

  

for the company’s market risk related to interest rates a sensitivity analysis referred to as a net interest revenue simulation model is shown below the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on its interestearning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources that finance these assets 

  

net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets include residential real estate loans and mortgagebacked securities these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and to changes to prepayment levels which tend to increase in a declining rate environment 

  

to mitigate the risk of loss the company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interestearning assets and funding sources to remain within these guidelines the company manages the maturity repricing and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios because the company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients the rates charged on margin loans and controls the composition of its investment securities it has some ability to manage its net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions 

  

the company is also subject to market risk as a result of fluctuations in equity prices the company’s direct holdings of equity securities and its associated exposure to equity prices are not material the company is indirectly exposed to equity market fluctuations in connection with securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers and customer securities loaned out as part of the company’s securities lending activities equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity margin borrowing and overall client engagement with the company additionally the company earns mutual fund service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the company 

  

financial instruments held by the company are also subject to liquidity risk – that is the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument recent conditions in the credit markets have significantly reduced market liquidity in a wide range of financial instruments including the types of instruments held by the company and fair value can differ significantly from the value implied by the credit quality and actual performance of the instrument’s underlying cash flows 

  

financial instruments held by the company are also subject to valuation risk as a result of changes in valuations of the underlying collateral such as housing prices in the case of residential real estate loans and mortgagebacked securities 

  

for discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees net interest revenue and securities available for sale see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – current market and regulatory environment” 

  

the company’s market risk related to financial instruments held for trading and forward sale and interest rate lock commitments related to its loans held for sale portfolio is not material 

  

net interest revenue simulation 

  

the company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulation model the model includes all interestsensitive assets and liabilities key variables in the model include the repricing of financial instruments prepayment and reinvestment assumptions and product pricing assumptions the company uses constant balances and market rates in the model assumptions in order to minimize the number of variables and to better isolate risks the simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and as a result cannot precisely 

  

 43  

the charles schwab corporation 

  

estimate net interest revenue or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies including changes in asset and liability mix 

  

as represented by the simulations presented below the company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall ie interestearning assets generally reprice more quickly than interestbearing liabilities 

  

the simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as the company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood the company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the results of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to the company’s current market rates forecast on simulated net interest revenue over the next 12 months beginning december 31 2010 and 2009 

  

   

the sensitivities shown in the simulation reflect the fact that shortterm interest rates in 2010 remained at historically low levels including the federal funds target rate which was unchanged at a range of zero to 025 the current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources in a declining interest rate scenario a decline in interest rates could therefore negatively impact the yield on the company’s investment portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense further compressing net interest margin any increases in shortterm interest rates result in a greater impact as yields on interestearning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources

schwab bank is subject to regulation and supervision and to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state laws including regulatory capital guidelines among other things these requirements govern transactions with csc and its nondepository institution subsidiaries including loans and other extensions of credit investments or asset purchases dividends and investments the federal banking agencies have broad powers to enforce these regulations including the power to terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver schwab bank is required to maintain a capital level that at least equals minimum capital levels specified in federal banking laws and regulations failure to meet the minimum levels will result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on schwab bank 

  

the securities industry in the united states is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws schwab is registered as a brokerdealer with the securities and exchange commission sec the fifty states and the district of columbia and puerto rico schwab and csim are registered as investment advisors with the sec additionally schwab is regulated by the commodities futures trading commission cftc with respect to the futures and commodities trading activities it conducts as an introducing broker 

  

much of the regulation of brokerdealers has been delegated to selfregulatory organizations sros namely the financial industry regulatory authority inc finra and the municipal securities rulemaking board msrb schwab is a member of the nasdaq stock market and the chicago board options exchange and is consequently subject to their rules and regulations the primary regulators of schwab are the finra and for municipal securities the msrb the cftc has designated the national futures association nfa as schwab’s primary regulator for futures and commodities trading activities the company’s business is also subject to oversight by regulatory bodies in other countries in which the company operates 

  

the principal purpose of regulating brokerdealers and investment advisors is the protection of clients and the securities markets the regulations to which brokerdealers and investment advisors are subject cover all aspects of the securities business including among other things sales and trading practices publication of research margin lending uses and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities capital adequacy recordkeeping and reporting fee arrangements disclosure to clients fiduciary duties owed to advisory clients and the conduct of directors officers and employees 

  

as a registered brokerdealer schwab is subject to rule 15c31 under the securities exchange act of 1934 the uniform net capital rule and related sro requirements the cftc and nfa also impose net capital requirements the uniform net capital rule specifies minimum capital requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of brokerdealers because csc itself is not a registered brokerdealer it is not subject to the uniform net capital rule however if schwab failed to maintain specified levels of net capital such failure would constitute a default by csc under certain debt covenants

the charles schwab corporation 

  

the uniform net capital rule limits brokerdealers’ ability to transfer capital to parent companies and other affiliates compliance with the uniform net capital rule could limit schwab’s operations and its ability to repay subordinated debt to csc which in turn could limit csc’s ability to repay debt pay cash dividends and purchase shares of its outstanding stock 

  

sources of net revenues 

  

the company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees net interest revenue and trading revenue the company generates asset management and administration fees through its proprietary and thirdparty mutual fund offerings as well as feebased investment management and advisory services net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets such as cash short and longterm investments and mortgage and margin loans and interest paid on funding sources including deposits in banking and brokerage accounts shortterm borrowings and longterm debt the company generates trading revenues through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenues from trading activity in fixed income securities

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

the company faces a variety of risks that may affect its operations or financial results and many of those risks are driven by factors that the company cannot control or predict the following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant although there may be other risks that could arise or may prove to be more significant than expected that may affect the company’s operations or financial results 

  

for a discussion of the company’s risk management including technology and operating risk credit risk concentration risk market risk fiduciary risk and legal and regulatory risk see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – risk management” 

  

developments in the business economic and geopolitical environment could negatively impact the company’s business 

  

the company’s business can be adversely affected by the general environment – economic corporate securities market regulatory and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations trading activity interest rates and overall investor engagement and are outside of the company’s control deterioration in the housing and credit markets reductions in shortterm interest rates and decreases in securities valuations are negatively impacting the company’s net interest revenue asset management and administration fees and capital resources

the charles schwab corporation 

  

a significant decrease in the company’s liquidity could negatively affect the company’s business and financial management as well as reduce client confidence in the company 

  

maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to the business operations of the company including margin lending mortgage lending and transaction settlement among other liquidity needs the company meets its liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by client activity and operating earnings as well as cash provided by external financing fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances as well as changes in market conditions may affect the company’s ability to meet its liquidity needs a reduction in the company’s liquidity position could reduce client confidence in the company which could result in the loss of client accounts in addition if the company’s brokerdealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to csc which could reduce csc’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt and pay cash dividends 

  

factors which may adversely affect the company’s liquidity position include a reduction in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts andor a dramatic increase in the company’s client lending activities including margin and personal lending the company also experiences liquidity demands as a result of brokerage client asset flows in the ordinary course of business clients’ asset flows between cash balances and investment products and timing differences between when amounts are segregated for regulatory purposes and when amounts are required to fund settlement of client transactions can create significant daily changes in the company’s cash position the unpredictability of such timing differences and liquidity demands has increased with recent market conditions as client asset flows have become more volatile 

  

when cash generated by client activity and operating earnings is not sufficient for the company’s liquidity needs the company must seek external financing due to significant disruptions in the credit and capital markets potential sources of external financing have been reduced for many firms and borrowing costs have increased although csc and schwab maintain uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines and csc has a commercial paper issuance program as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions and disruptions in the credit markets in addition a significant downgrade in the company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets 

  

the company may suffer significant losses from its credit exposures 

  

the company’s businesses are subject to the risk that a client counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate while the company has policies and procedures designed to manage this risk the policies and procedures may not be fully effective the company’s exposure mainly results from margin lending activities securities lending activities mortgage lending activities its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds that the company sponsors 

  

the company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale and securities held to maturity portfolios which includes us agency and nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities consumer loan assetbacked securities corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit among other investments these instruments are also subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial market’s assessment of issuer credit quality increases in the unemployment rate delinquency and default rates housing price declines changes in prevailing interest rates and other economic factors 

  

loss of value of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity can result in charges if management determines that the impairments are other than temporary the evaluation of whether otherthantemporary impairment exists is a matter of judgment which includes the assessment of several factors see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting estimates” if management determines that a security is otherthantemporarily impaired the cost basis of the security may be adjusted and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings certain securities available for sale experienced deteriorating credit characteristics in 2009 which resulted in impairment charges deterioration in the performance of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity could result in the recognition of future impairment charges

the charles schwab corporation 

  

the company’s loans to banking clients primarily consist of firstlien mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit increases in delinquency and default rates housing price declines increases in the unemployment rate and other economic factors can result in charges for loan loss reserves and write downs on such loans 

  

heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments concentration risk can increase the company’s risk of loss examples of the company’s credit concentration risk include 

  

   

   

   

the company may also be subject to concentration risk when lending to a particular counterparty borrower or issuer 

  

the company sponsors a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds although the company has no obligation to do so the company may decide for competitive reasons to provide credit liquidity or other support to its funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity such support could cause the company to take significant charges and could reduce the company’s liquidity if the company chose not to provide credit liquidity or other support in such a situation the company could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected  

  

significant interest rate changes could affect the company’s profitability and financial condition 

  

the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interestearning assets such as cash short and longterm investments and mortgage and margin loans relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources including deposits in banking and brokerage accounts shortterm borrowings and longterm debt changes in interest rates generally affect the interest earned on interestearning assets differently than the interest the company pays on its interestbearing liabilities in addition certain funding sources do not bear interest and their cost therefore does not vary overall the company is positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment the company could be adversely affected by a decline in interest rates if the rates that the company earns on interestearning assets decline more than the rates that the company pays on its funding sources or if prepayment rates increase on the mortgages and mortgagebacked securities that the company holds with the low interest rate environment the company’s revenue from interestearning assets has been declining more than the rates that the company pays on its funding sources the company may also be limited in the amount it can reduce interest rates on deposit accounts and still offer a competitive return 

  

to the extent certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds replace maturing securities with lower yielding securities and the overall yield on such funds falls to a level at or below the management fees on those funds the company may waive a portion of its fee in order to continue providing some return to clients as a result of the low interest rate environment the company has been waiving and may continue to waive a portion of its management fees for certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds such fee waivers negatively impact the company’s asset management and administration fees 

  

the company is subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not always be successful in defending itself against such claims or proceedings 

  

the financial services industry faces substantial litigation and regulatory risks the company is subject to arbitration claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business as well as class actions and other significant litigation the company is also the subject of inquiries investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies actions brought against the company may result in settlements awards injunctions fines penalties or other results adverse to the company including reputational harm even if the company is successful in defending against these actions the defense of such matters may result in the company incurring significant expenses predicting the outcome of matters is inherently difficult particularly where claims are brought on behalf of various classes of claimants claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages or when investigations or legal proceedings are at an early stage a substantial judgment settlement fine or penalty could be material to the company’s operating results or cash flows for a particular future period depending on the

the charles schwab corporation 

  

company’s results for that period in market downturns the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased see “item 3 – legal proceedings” 

  

from time to time the company is subject to litigation claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights eg patents such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources if the company was found to have infringed a thirdparty patent or other intellectual property rights it could incur substantial liability and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology or providing certain products or services 

  

extensive regulation of the company’s businesses limits the company’s activities and may subject it to significant penalties 

  

as a participant in the securities banking and financial services industries the company is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws by governmental agencies supervisory authorities and sros such regulation is expected to become more extensive and complex in response to the recent market disruptions the requirements imposed by the company’s regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets the safety and soundness of financial institutions and the protection of clients these regulations often serve to limit the company’s activities by way of capital customer protection and market conduct requirements and restrictions on the businesses activities that the company may conduct despite the company’s efforts to comply with applicable regulations there are a number of risks particularly in areas where applicable regulations may be unclear or where regulators revise their previous guidance any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by the company’s regulators against the company or its affiliates officers or employees could result in fines penalties cease and desist orders enforcement actions suspension or expulsion or other disciplinary sanctions including limitations on the company’s business activities any of which could harm the company’s reputation and adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively impact the company’s business and financial results 

  

new legislation rule changes or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal state and sro rules and regulations may directly affect the operation and profitability of the company or its specific business lines the profitability of the company could also be affected by rules and regulations which impact the business and financial communities generally including changes to the laws governing taxation electronic commerce client privacy and security of client data in addition the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business the company conducts modifications to the company’s business practices increased capital requirements or additional costs 

  

the company’s industry is characterized by aggressive price competition 

  

the company continually monitors its pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjusts trade commission rates interest rates on deposits and loans fees for advisory services and other fee structures to enhance its competitive position increased price competition from other financial services firms such as reduced commissions to attract trading volume or higher deposit rates to attract client cash balances could impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

the industry in which the company competes has undergone a period of consolidation 

  

the company faces intense competition for the clients that it serves and the products and services it offers there has been significant consolidation as financial institutions with which the company competes have been acquired by or merged into or acquired other firms this consolidation may continue competition is based on many factors including the range of products and services offered pricing customer service brand recognition reputation and perceived financial strength consolidations may enable other firms to offer a broader range of products and services than the company does or offer such products at more competitive prices

the charles schwab corporation 

  

the company faces competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees especially for employees who are key to the company’s ability to build and enhance client relationships

the company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees net interest revenue and trading revenue the company generates asset management and administration fees through its proprietary and thirdparty mutual fund offerings as well as feebased investment management and advisory services net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on funding sources asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue are impacted by securities valuations interest rates the company’s ability to attract new clients and client activity levels the company generates trading revenues through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenues from trading activity in fixed income securities trading revenues are impacted by trading volumes the volatility of prices in the equity and fixed income markets and commission rates 

  

2009 compared to 2008 

  

economic and market conditions remained challenging throughout 2009 marked by unprecedented market dynamics including further declines in shortterm interest rates and home valuations increases in home foreclosures and delinquencies and tight credit markets while the federal funds target rate remained unchanged at a range of zero to 025 the threemonth libor decreased by 158 basis points to 025 at the same time although the equity markets showed sustained improvement from their march 2009 lows – the nasdaq composite index the standard  poor’s 500 index and the dow jones industrial average increased during the year by 44 24 and 19 respectively – average equity market valuations declined in 2009 from 2008 

  

in this shifting market environment clients continued to actively utilize the company’s products and services the company attracted 873 billion in net new client assets during the year total client assets were 142 trillion at december 31 2009 up 25 from the prior year reflecting the company’s success in continuing to attract and retain clients client trading activity slowed modestly during the year as clients’ daily average trades decreased 4 to 333600 in 2009 from 2008 

  

net revenues decreased by 19 in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to the decreases in asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue asset management and administration fees decreased in 2009 primarily due to money market mutual fund fee waivers and lower average equity market valuations given the low interest rate environment the overall yields on certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds have fallen to levels at or below the management fees on those funds as a result the company waived a portion of its fees which totaled 224 million in order to provide a positive return to clients there were no money market mutual fund fee waivers in 2008 or 2007 net interest revenue decreased as a result of the low interest rate environment partially offset by higher average balances of interestearning assets these decreases were offset by the increase in other revenue other revenue in 2009 included a 31 million gain on the repurchase of a portion of the company’s longterm debt in addition other revenue in 2008 included a loss of 29 million on the sale of a corporate debt security held in the company’s available for sale portfolio net revenues were also negatively impacted by net impairment charges of 60 million in 2009 relating to certain residential mortgagebacked securities in the company’s available for sale portfolio net impairment losses on securities in 2008 included an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 44 million related to a corporate debt security held in the company’s available for sale portfolio 

  

expenses excluding interest decreased by 7 in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to the decreases in compensation and benefits professional services and advertising and market development expenses the decrease in expenses was partially offset by severance and facilities charges of 101 million relating to the company’s cost reduction measures and a 16 million federal deposit insurance corporation fdic special industry assessment 

  

as a result of the company’s cost reduction measures and ongoing expense discipline the company achieved a pretax profit margin from continuing operations of 304 and return on stockholders’ equity of 17 in 2009 net revenue per average fulltime equivalent employee was 338000 in 2009 down 12 from 2008 due to lower net revenues partially offset by the decrease in average fulltime equivalent employees 

  

2008 compared to 2007 

  

2008 was also marked by extraordinary market conditions including downward pressure on home prices tight credit markets liquidity concerns significant volatility and sharp declines in the equity markets and slow general economic activity the

nasdaq composite index standard  poor’s 500 index and the dow jones industrial average decreased in 2008 by 41 38 and 34 respectively with a significant portion of these decreases occurring in the fourth quarter in addition the federal funds target rate decreased during 2008 by 425 to a range of zero to 025 at december 31 2008 

  

net new client assets totaled 1134 billion for 2008 down 29 from 2007 reflecting deterioration in the equity markets and lower asset valuations total client assets were 114 trillion at december 31 2008 down 21 from december 31 2007 additionally clients’ daily average trades increased 22 to 346600 in 2008 from 2007 

  

net revenues grew by 3 in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to an increase in trading revenue partially offset by a decrease in other revenue as well as net impairment losses on securities incurred in 2008 trading revenue increased in 2008 primarily due to higher trading volume as a result of significant volatility in the equity markets during the year the decrease in other revenue related to a loss of 29 million on the sale of a corporate debt security and net impairment losses on securities included an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 44 million related to another corporate debt security which were held in the company’s available for sale portfolio asset management and administration fees remained relatively flat in 2008 reflecting the company’s ability to attract and retain clients net interest revenue increased slightly in 2008 due to higher levels of interestearning assets offset by the impact of a decrease in the average net yield earned on these assets 

  

although expenses excluding interest remained relatively flat in 2008 compensation and benefits expense decreased reflecting lower incentive compensation while other expense and occupancy and equipment expense increased the loss from discontinued operations of 18 million in 2008 relates to the adjustment to finalize the income tax gain related to the sale of us trust the company’s pretax profit margin from continuing operations was 394 and return on stockholders’ equity was 31 in 2008 which reflected the company’s sustained expense discipline during the year return on stockholders’ equity in 2007 included a 12 billion aftertax gain on the sale of us trust as well as incremental interest revenue generated from temporarily investing the proceeds from the sale net revenue per average fulltime equivalent employee was 383000 in 2008 down 1 from 2007 as net revenue growth was lower than the increase in average fulltime equivalent employees 

  

certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation all references to eps information in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflect diluted eps unless otherwise noted 

  

subsequent event 

  

on january 26 2010 the company completed the sale of 29670300 shares of its common stock 01 par value at a public offering price of 1900 per share net proceeds received from the offering were 543 million and will be used to support the company’s balance sheet growth including expansion of its deposit base and potential migration of certain client balances from money market funds into schwab bank 

  

current market environment 

  

the difficult market conditions in 2009 continue to adversely affect the company’s net revenues 

  

while the company generally earns asset management and administration fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets these fees are currently being affected by the low interest rate environment as well the overall yields on certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds have fallen to levels at or below the management fees on those funds the company continues to waive a portion of its management fees which it began to do in the first quarter of 2009 so that the funds may continue providing a positive return to clients these and other money market mutual funds may continue to find it necessary to replace maturing securities with lower yielding securities as a result of the current interest rate environment and the overall yield on such funds may fall below or further below the management fees on those funds to the extent this occurs the amount of fees waived may increase from fourth quarter 2009 levels which would adversely affect asset management and administration fees

given the low interest rate environment the company’s revenue from interestearning assets such as securities held and loans to clients was declining more than the interest that the company pays on funding sources such as client deposits the company’s ability to reduce the interest expense paid on funding sources has been limited as the rates paid on funding sources which are largely tied to shorterterm interest rates approached zero concurrently interestearning asset yields which are often tied to longerterm interest rates continued to decline by the end of 2009 however the pace of further declines in interestearning asset yields had slowed significantly 

  

the company recorded net impairment charges of 60 million related to certain nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities in 2009 due to credit deterioration of the securities’ underlying collateral further deterioration in the performance of the underlying loans in the company’s residential mortgagebacked securities portfolio could result in the recognition of additional future impairment charges 

  

results of operations 

  

the following discussion presents an analysis of the company’s results of operations for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

  

net revenues

assets invested in the company’s proprietary funds and thirdparty funds the company also earns asset management fees for advisory and managed account services which are based on the daily balances of client assets subject to the specific fee for service the fair values of client assets included in proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data asset management and administration fees may vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity for discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees see “current market environment” 

  

as shown in the following table asset management and administration fees decreased by 480 million or 20 in 2009 from 2008 this decrease was due to decreases in mutual fund service fees and investment management and trust fees 

  

  

nm not meaningful 

  

mutual fund service fees decreased by 414 million or 22 in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to money market mutual fund fee waivers given the low interest rate environment in 2009 the overall yields on certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds have fallen to levels at or below the management fees on those funds as a result the company waived a portion of its fees which totaled 224 million in 2009 in order to provide a positive return to clients there were no money market mutual fund fee waivers in 2008 or 2007 in addition mutual fund service fees decreased during the year due to lower average balances of client assets invested in the company’s mutual fund onesource funds and mutual fund clearing services as a result of lower average equity market valuations 

  

investment management and trust fees decreased by 67 million or 20 in 2009 from 2008 due to temporary fee rebates offered to qualifying clients for choosing to participate in advisory or managed account services programs 

  

asset management and administration fees remained relatively flat in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to lower thirdparty mutual fund and advisory service fees partially offset by higher proprietary fund fees mutual fund onesource service fees decreased by 77 million or 12 in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to lower average balances of client assets invested in the company’s mutual fund onesource funds the company’s proprietary mutual fund service fees increased 98 million or 8 in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to higher average balances of client assets invested in the company’s money market mutual funds investment management and trust fees decreased by 38 million or 10 in 2008 from 2007 due to lower average balances of client assets participating in advisory and managed account services programs 

  

net interest revenue 

  

net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on funding sources net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies the company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall ie interestearning assets generally reprice more quickly than interestbearing liabilities when interest rates fall the company attempts to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lockin asset yields as well as by lowering rates paid to clients on interestbearing liabilities since the company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients as well as the rates charged on receivables from brokerage clients and also controls the composition of its investment securities it has some ability to manage its net interest spread however the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition for discussion of the impact of current market conditions on net interest revenue see “current market environment”

liabilities compared to 2008 with yields on interestearning assets declining more than the cost of funding sources as shortterm interest rates approached zero the mix of interestearning assets also negatively affected net interest revenue – most notably the decrease in average margin loans resulted in higher average balances of cash and investments segregated a lower yielding asset category the effect of the low interest rate environment and asset mix was partially offset by the growth in average balances the company experienced significant growth in deposits from banking clients which in turn funded increases in the average balances of securities available for sale loans to banking clients and cash and cash equivalents 

  

net interest revenue slightly increased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to higher average balances of interestearning assets including increases in securities available for sale and loans to banking clients offset by lower yields on interestearning assets net interest revenue in 2007 included incremental interest revenue generated from temporarily investing the proceeds from the sale of us trust consistent with declines in general market interest rates prevalent in 2008 the company experienced declines in the yields of all interestearning assets during 2008 as compared to 2007 accordingly the average interest rates on deposits from banking clients and payables to brokerage clients also decreased during 2008 the decline in the average interest rate on longterm debt was due to the additional debt issued at lower interest rates as part of the company’s capital restructuring in 2007

csc 

  

as a savings and loan holding company csc is not subject to specific statutory capital requirements however csc is required to maintain capital that is sufficient to support the holding company and its subsidiaries’ business activities and the risks inherent in those activities to manage capital adequacy csc currently utilizes a target tier 1 leverage ratio as defined by the board of governors of the federal reserve system of at least 6 at december 31 2009 csc’s tier 1 leverage ratio was 71 

  

csc’s liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries as well as cash provided by external financing csc maintains excess liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and shortterm investments to cover daily funding needs and to support growth in the company’s business generally csc does not hold liquidity at its subsidiaries in excess of amounts deemed sufficient to support the subsidiaries’ operations including any regulatory capital requirements schwab and schwab bank are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with csc management believes that funds generated by the operations of csc’s subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting csc’s liquidity needs providing adequate liquidity to meet schwab bank’s capital guidelines and maintaining schwab’s net capital 

  

csc has liquidity needs that arise from its senior mediumterm notes series a mediumterm notes junior subordinated notes and senior notes as well as from the funding of cash dividends acquisitions and other investments the mediumterm notes of which 450 million were outstanding at december 31 2009 have maturities ranging from 2010 to 2017 and fixed interest rates ranging from 6375 to 805 with interest payable semiannually the mediumterm notes are rated a2 by moody’s investors service moody’s a by standard  poor’s ratings group standard  poor’s and a by fitch ratings ltd fitch at december 31 2009 202 million of junior subordinated notes were outstanding and have a fixed interest rate of 750 until 2017 and a floating rate thereafter the junior subordinated notes are not rated however the trust preferred securities related to these notes are rated baa1 by moody’s bbb by standard  poor’s and bbb by fitch in 2009 csc repurchased 98 million of trust preferred securities related to its junior subordinated notes for a cash payment of 67 million the repurchase of the trust preferred securities is considered an extinguishment of a portion of the junior subordinated notes and resulted in a gain of 31 million

commercial paper notes outstanding the financial covenants under this facility require schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio as defined schwab bank to be well capitalized as defined and csc to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity at december 31 2009 the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was 33 billion management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on csc’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements 

  

csc also has direct access to 744 million of the 824 million uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines discussed below that are primarily utilized by schwab to manage shortterm liquidity these lines were not used by csc in 2009 

  

in addition schwab provides csc with a 10 billion credit facility maturing in december 2011 no funds were drawn under this facility at december 31 2009 

  

schwab 

  

schwab is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of brokerdealers these regulations prohibit schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings from csc paying cash dividends or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in net capital of less than 5 of aggregate debit balances or less than 120 of its minimum dollar requirement of 250000 at december 31 2009 schwab’s net capital was 11 billion 11 of aggregate debit balances which was 868 million in excess of its minimum required net capital and 580 million in excess of 5 of aggregate debit balances 

  

most of schwab’s assets are readily convertible to cash consisting primarily of shortterm ie less than 150 days investmentgrade interestearning investments the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements receivables from brokerage clients and receivables from brokers dealers and clearing organizations client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities receivables from and payables to brokers dealers and clearing organizations primarily represent current open transactions which usually settle or can be closed out within a few business days 

  

liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts which were 253 billion and 192 billion at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for schwab in the future 

  

schwab has a finance lease obligation related to an office building and land under a 20year lease the remaining finance lease obligation of 111 million at december 31 2009 is being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term of approximately 15 years 

  

to manage shortterm liquidity schwab maintains uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines with a group of seven banks totaling 824 million at december 31 2009 the need for shortterm borrowings arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements scheduled liquidation of interestbearing investments and movements of cash to meet segregation requirements schwab used such borrowings for ten days in 2009 with daily amounts borrowed averaging 18 million there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at december 31 2009

in addition csc provides schwab with a 15 billion credit facility which is scheduled to expire in 2011 borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for schwab there were no funds drawn under this facility at december 31 2009 

  

schwab bank 

  

schwab bank is required to maintain a capital level that at least equals minimum capital levels specified in federal banking laws and regulations failure to meet the minimum levels will result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on schwab bank based on its regulatory capital ratios at december 31 2009 schwab bank is considered well capitalized schwab bank’s regulatory capital and ratios at december 31 2009 are as follows

schwab bank has access to traditional funding sources such as deposits federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements additionally schwab bank has access to shortterm funding through the federal reserve bank frb discount window amounts available under the frb discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain of schwab bank’s securities available for sale and securities held to maturity that are pledged as collateral at december 31 2009 974 million was available under this arrangement there were no funds drawn under this arrangement during 2009

the company’s total financial capital longterm debt plus stockholders’ equity at december 31 2009 was 66 billion up 16 billion or 33 from december 31 2008 

  

at december 31 2009 the company had longterm debt of 15 billion or 23 of total financial capital that bears interest at a weightedaverage rate of 597 at december 31 2008 the company had longterm debt of 883 million or 18 of total financial capital in june 2009 the company issued 750 million of senior notes that mature in 2014 and have a fixed interest rate of 4950 the company repaid 13 million and 20 million of longterm debt in 2009 and 2008 respectively in addition the company repurchased 98 million of trust preferred securities related to its junior subordinated notes for a cash payment of 67 million in 2009 resulting in a gain of 31 million 

  

the company’s cash position reported as cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated balance sheet and cash flows are affected by changes in brokerage client cash balances and the associated amounts required to be segregated under regulatory guidelines timing differences between cash and investments actually segregated on a given date and the amount required to be segregated for that date may arise in the ordinary course of business and are addressed by the company in accordance with applicable regulations other factors which affect the company’s cash position and cash flows include investment activity in securities levels of capital expenditures acquisition and divestiture activity banking client deposit activity brokerage and banking client loan activity financing activity in longterm debt payments of dividends and repurchases of csc’s common stock the combination of these factors can cause significant fluctuations in the levels of cash and cash equivalents during specific time periods

management currently anticipates that 2010 capital expenditures will be approximately 5 lower than 2009 spending primarily due to decreased spending on leasehold improvements partially offset by increased costs for developing internaluse software as has been the case in recent years the company may adjust its capital expenditures from period to period as business conditions change management believes that funds generated by its operations will continue to be the primary funding source of its capital expenditures

technology and operating risk 

  

technology and operating risk is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems that constrain the company’s ability to gather process and communicate information and process client transactions efficiently and securely without interruptions the company’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and the company’s success depends in part on its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its technology in anticipation of evolving client needs to the extent the company experiences system interruptions errors or downtime which could result from a variety of causes including changes in client use patterns technological failure changes to its systems linkages with thirdparty systems and power failures the company’s business and operations could be significantly negatively impacted additionally rapid increases in client demand may strain the company’s ability to enhance its technology and expand its operating capacity to minimize business interruptions schwab has two data centers intended in part to further improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency the company is committed to an ongoing process of upgrading enhancing and testing its technology systems this effort is focused on meeting client needs meeting market and regulatory changes and deploying standardized technology platforms

market risk 

  

market risk is the potential for changes in revenue or the value of financial instruments held by the company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or market conditions for discussion of the company’s market risk see “item 7a – quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

  

fiduciary risk 

  

fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client fiduciary activities include but are not limited to individual and institutional trust investment management custody and cash and securities processing the company attempts to manage this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business guidance and control are provided through the creation approval and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees 

  

legal and regulatory risk 

  

the company faces significant legal and compliance risk in its business and the volume of litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed have been increasing among other things these risks relate to the suitability of client investments conflicts of interest disclosure obligations and performance expectations for company products and services supervision of employees and the adequacy of the company’s controls claims against the company may increase due to a variety of factors such as if clients suffer losses during a period of deteriorating equity market conditions as the company increases the level of advice it provides to clients and as the company enhances the services it provides to ias in addition the company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal state and foreign regulatory authorities and sros and such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex

fair value of financial instruments 

  

the company uses fair value measurements to record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value and to determine fair value disclosures at december 31 2009 301 billion or 40 of total assets were recorded at fair value at december 31 2008 219 billion or 42 of total assets were recorded at fair value all of these assets were measured at fair value using quoted prices or marketbased information and accordingly were classified as level 1 or level 2 measurements in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described in fair value measurement accounting guidance liabilities recorded at fair value were not material at december 31 2009 or 2008 see note “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – 15 fair value of assets and liabilities” for more information on the company’s assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value 

  

the company uses prices obtained from an independent thirdparty pricing service to measure the fair value of certain investment securities the company validates prices received from the pricing service using various methods including comparison to prices received from additional pricing services comparison to available quoted market prices internal valuation models and review of other relevant market data the company does not adjust the prices received from the independent thirdparty pricing service unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts at december 31 2009 and 2008 the company did not adjust prices received from the independent thirdparty pricing service for certificates of deposits and treasury securities included in investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes the company uses discounted cashflow models to measure the fair value that utilize marketbased inputs including observable market interest rates that correspond to the remaining maturities or next interest reset dates 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

the consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us while the majority of the company’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are not based on estimates there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position and reported financial results these critical accounting estimates are described below management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the company’s financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy 

  

otherthantemporary impairment of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity  management evaluates whether securities available for sale and securities held to maturity are otherthantemporarily impaired otti on a quarterly basis debt securities with unrealized losses are considered otti if the company intends to sell the security or if the company will be required to sell such security prior to any anticipated recovery if management determines that a security is otti under these circumstances the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between the amortized cost and thencurrent fair value 

  

a security is also otti if management does not expect to recover the amortized cost of the security in this circumstance management utilizes cash flow models to estimate the expected future cash flow from the securities and to estimate the credit loss the impairment recognized in earnings is measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security expected cash flows are discounted using the security’s effective interest rate 

  

the evaluation of whether the company expects to recover the amortized cost of a security is inherently judgmental the evaluation includes the assessment of several bond performance indicators including the portion of the underlying loans that are delinquent 30 days 60 days 90 days in bankruptcy in foreclosure or converted to real estate owned the actual amount of loss incurred on the underlying loans in which the property has been foreclosed and sold the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security available to absorb credit losses on the underlying loans the current credit ratings issued by either standard  poor’s fitch ratings or moody’s the current price and magnitude of the unrealized loss and whether the company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments management uses cash flow models to further assess the likelihood of otherthantemporary impairment for the company’s nonagency residential mortgagebacked

securities to develop the cash flow models the company uses forecasted loss severity prepayment speeds ie the rate at which the principal on underlying loans are paid down and default rates over the securities’ remaining maturities forecasted home price fluctuations are an important variable in forecasting the expected loss severity and default rates based on these cash flow projections management determines if the company expects to recover all of the amortized cost of the securities and therefore if the securities are otti 

  

valuation of goodwill  the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever indications of impairment exist an impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value resulting in an impairment charge for this excess 

  

the company has elected april 1 st as its annual goodwill impairment testing date in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on april 1 2009 management estimated the fair value of each of the company’s reporting units generally defined as the company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management and compared this value to the carrying value of the reporting unit the estimated fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value and therefore management concluded that no amount of goodwill was impaired the estimated fair value of the reporting units was established using a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit adverse changes in the company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition a loss of key personnel the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the company’s recorded goodwill 

  

allowance for credit losses the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed regularly by management taking into consideration current economic conditions the existing loan portfolio composition past loss experience and risks inherent in the portfolio as more fully described below 

  

the company performs a quarterly analysis to estimate the allowance for credit losses this process utilizes loanlevel statistical models that estimate prepayments defaults and expected life of loan losses for our loan portfolios based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the portfolios the models consider effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including but not limited to interest rate fluctuations housing price movements current economic conditions estimated defaults and foreclosures delinquencies the loan portfolio composition including concentrations of credit risk past loss experience estimates of loss severity and credit scores 

  

the more significant variables within the models include a measure of delinquency roll rates the amount of loss in the event of default housing prices and interest rates delinquency roll rates ie the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result in a loss are estimated from the company’s historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information loss in the event of default is based on the company’s historical loss experience and market trends housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and statistical forecasts of future home values factors affecting the home price index include housing inventory unemployment interest rates and inflation expectations interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths this quarterly analysis results in a loss factor that is applied to the outstanding balances to determine the allowance for credit loss for each loan category 

  

legal reserve  reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter after considering among other factors the progress of the case prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases available defenses insurance coverage and indemnification and the opinions and views of legal counsel in many cases including most class action lawsuits it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred or to estimate the range of that loss until the matter is close to resolution in which case no accrual is made until that time reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved 

  

the company’s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee additionally management has reviewed with the audit committee the company’s significant estimates discussed in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

market risk is the potential for changes in revenue or the value of financial instruments held by the company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or market conditions 

  

for the company’s market risk related to interest rates a sensitivity analysis referred to as a net interest revenue simulation model is shown below the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interestearning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources that finance these assets 

  

net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interest bearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets include residential real estate loans and residential mortgagebacked securities these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and to changes to prepayment levels which tend to increase in a declining rate environment 

  

to mitigate the risk of loss the company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interestearning assets and funding sources to remain within these guidelines the company manages the maturity repricing and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios because the company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients the rates charged on margin loans and controls the composition of its investment securities it has some ability to manage its net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions 

  

the company is also subject to market risk as a result of fluctuations in equity prices the company’s direct holdings of equity securities and its associated exposure to equity prices are not material the company is indirectly exposed to equity market fluctuations in connection with securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers and customer securities loaned out as part of the company’s securities lending activities equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity margin borrowing and overall client engagement with the company additionally the company earns mutual fund service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the company 

  

financial instruments held by the company are also subject to liquidity risk – that is the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument recent conditions in the credit markets have significantly reduced market liquidity in a wide range of financial instruments including the types of instruments held by the company and fair value can differ significantly from the value implied by the credit quality and actual performance of the instrument’s underlying cash flows 

  

financial instruments held by the company are also subject to valuation risk as a result of changes in valuations of the underlying collateral such as housing prices in the case of residential real estate loans and mortgagebacked securities 

  

for discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees net interest revenue and securities available for sale see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – current market environment” 

  

the company’s market risk related to financial instruments held for trading interest rate swaps related to a portion of its fixed interest rate mediumterm notes and forward sale and interest rate lock commitments related to its loans held for sale portfolio is not material 

  

net interest revenue simulation 

  

the company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulation model the model includes all interestsensitive assets and liabilities as well as interest rate swap agreements utilized by the company to hedge its interest rate risk key variables in the model include the repricing of 

  

 39  

the charles schwab corporation 

  

financial instruments prepayment and reinvestment assumptions and product pricing assumptions the company uses constant balances and market rates in the model assumptions in order to minimize the number of variables and to better isolate risks the simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and as a result cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies including changes in asset and liability mix 

  

as represented by the simulations presented below the company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall ie interestearning assets generally reprice more quickly than interestbearing liabilities 

  

the simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as the company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood the company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the results of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to the company’s current market rates forecast on simulated net interest revenue over the next 12 months at december 31 2009 and 2008 while the company typically uses a gradual 200 basis point change it revised the methodology at march 31 2008 due to the current low levels of interest rates the company will use a gradual 100 basis point change until such time as the level of interest rates justifies a return to the previous methodology 

  

   

the sensitivities shown in the simulation reflect the fact that shortterm interest rates in 2009 continued to decline even though the fed funds target rate remained at a range of zero to 025 during 2009 the company’s yield on interestearning assets fell faster than its already low cost of funding sources since current shortterm interest rates are so low further declines have a lesser impact on net interest revenue while increases in shortterm interest rates result in a greater impact as yields on interestearning assets rise faster than the cost of funding sources

the company’s competition in serving individual investors includes a wide range of brokerage wealth management asset management firms banks and trust companies in serving these investors and competing for a growing percentage of the investable wealth in the us the company offers a multichannel service delivery model which includes branch telephonic and online capabilities under this model the company can offer personalized service at competitive prices while giving clients the choice of where when and how they do business with the company schwab’s branches and regional telephone service centers are staffed with trained and experienced financial consultants fcs focused on building and sustaining client relationships the company offers the ability to meet client investing needs through a single ongoing point of contact even as those needs change over time in particular management believes that the company’s ability to provide those clients seeking help guidance or advice with an integrated individually tailored solution – ranging from occasional consultations to an ongoing relationship with a schwab fc or an ia – is a competitive strength compared to the more fragmented offerings of other firms 

  

the company’s online and telephonic channels provide quick and efficient access to an extensive array of information research tools trade execution and administrative services which clients can access according to their needs for example as clients trade more actively they can use these channels to access highly competitive pricing expert tools and extensive service capabilities – including experienced knowledgeable teams of trading specialists and integrated product offerings

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

the company faces a variety of risks that may affect its operations or financial results and many of those risks are driven by factors that the company cannot control or predict the following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant although there may be other risks that could arise or may prove to be more significant than expected that may affect the company’s operations or financial results

developments in the business economic and geopolitical environment could negatively impact the company’s business 

  

the company’s business can be adversely affected by the general environment – economic corporate securities market regulatory and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations trading activity interest rates and overall investor engagement and are outside of the company’s control deterioration in the housing and credit markets reductions in shortterm interest rates and decreases in securities valuations are negatively impacting the company’s net interest revenue asset management and administration fees and capital resources 

  

a significant decrease in the company’s liquidity could negatively affect the company’s business and financial management as well as reduce client confidence in the company 

  

maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to the business operations of the company including margin lending mortgage lending and transaction settlement among other liquidity needs the company meets its liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by client activity and operating earnings as well as cash provided by external financing fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances as well as changes in market conditions may affect the company’s ability to meet its liquidity needs a reduction in the company’s liquidity position could reduce client confidence in the company which could result in the loss of client accounts in addition if the company’s brokerdealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to csc which could reduce csc’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt and pay cash dividends 

  

factors which may adversely affect the company’s liquidity position include a reduction in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts andor a dramatic increase in the company’s client lending activities including margin and personal lending the company also experiences liquidity demands as a result of brokerage client asset flows in the ordinary course of business clients’ asset flows between cash balances and investment products and timing differences between when amounts are segregated for regulatory purposes and when amounts are required to fund settlement of client transactions can create significant daily changes in the company’s cash position the unpredictability of such timing differences and liquidity demands has increased with recent market conditions as client asset flows have become more volatile 

  

when cash generated by client activity and operating earnings is not sufficient for the company’s liquidity needs the company must seek external financing due to significant disruptions in the credit and capital markets potential sources of external financing have been reduced for many firms and borrowing costs have increased although csc and schwab maintain uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines and csc has a commercial paper issuance program as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions and disruptions in the credit markets in addition a significant downgrade in the company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets 

  

the company may suffer significant losses from its credit exposures 

  

the company’s businesses are subject to the risk that a client or counterparty will fail to perform its contractual obligations or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate while the company has policies and procedures designed to manage this risk the policies and procedures may not be fully effective the company’s exposure mainly results from margin lending activities securities lending activities mortgage lending activities its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds that the company sponsors 

  

the company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale portfolio which includes us agency and nonagency collateralized mortgage obligations and corporate debt securities among other investments the company’s loans to banking clients primarily consist of firstlien mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit housing price declines increases in the unemployment rate increases in delinquency and default rates changes in the interest rate environment and other economic factors can result in writedowns on such loans and the loss of value of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity 

  

 7  

the charles schwab corporation 

  

loss of value of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity can result in charges if management determines that the impairments are other than temporary the evaluation of whether otherthantemporary impairment exists is a matter of judgment which includes the assessment of several factors see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting estimates” if management determines that a security is otherthantemporarily impaired the cost basis of the security must be adjusted to the thencurrent fair value and a corresponding loss must be recognized in current earnings certain securities available for sale experienced deteriorating credit characteristics in 2008 further deterioration in the performance of securities available for sale could result in the recognition of future impairment charges 

  

heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments concentration risk can increase the company’s risk of loss examples of the company’s credit concentration risk include 

  

   

   

   

the company may also be subject to concentration risk when lending to a particular counterparty borrower or issuer 

  

the company sponsors a number of proprietary money market funds although the company has no obligation to do so the company may decide for competitive reasons to provide credit liquidity or other support to its funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity such support could cause the company to take significant charges and could reduce the company’s liquidity if the company chose not to provide credit liquidity or other support in such a situation the company could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected  

  

significant interest rate changes could affect the company’s profitability and financial condition 

  

the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interestearning assets such as cash short and longterm investments and mortgage and margin loans relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources including deposits in banking and brokerage accounts shortterm borrowings and longterm debt changes in interest rates generally affect the interest earned on interestearning assets differently than the interest the company pays on its interestbearing liabilities in addition certain funding sources do not bear interest and their cost therefore does not vary overall the company is positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment the company could be adversely affected by a decline in interest rates if the rates that the company earns on interestearning assets decline more than the rates that the company pays on its funding sources or if prepayment rates increase on the mortgages and mortgagebacked securities that the company holds with the recent decline in interest rates the company’s revenue from interestearning assets has been declining more than the rates that the company pays on its funding sources the company may also be limited in the amount it can reduce interest rates on deposit accounts and still offer a competitive return 

  

to the extent certain money market mutual funds replace maturing securities with lower yielding securities and the overall yield on such funds falls to a level at or below the management fees on those funds the company may waive a portion of its fee in order to continue providing some return to clients such fee waivers negatively impact the company’s asset management and administration fees 

  

the company is subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not always be successful in defending itself against such claims or proceedings 

  

the financial services industry faces substantial litigation and regulatory risks the company is subject to arbitration claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business as well as class actions and other significant litigation the company is also the subject of inquiries investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies actions brought against the company may result in settlements awards injunctions fines penalties or other results adverse to the company predicting the outcome of matters is inherently difficult particularly where claims are brought on behalf of various classes of claimants claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages or when investigations or legal proceedings are at an early 

  

 8  

the charles schwab corporation 

  

stage a substantial judgment settlement fine or penalty could be material to the company’s operating results or cash flows for a particular future period depending on the company’s results for that period in market downturns the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased see “item 3 – legal proceedings” 

  

from time to time the company is subject to litigation claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights eg patents such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources if the company was found to have infringed a thirdparty patent or other intellectual property rights it could incur substantial liability and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology or providing certain products or services 

  

extensive regulation of the company’s businesses limits the company’s activities and may subject it to significant penalties 

  

as a participant in the securities banking and financial services industries the company is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws by governmental agencies supervisory authorities and sros such regulation is expected to become more extensive and complex in response to the recent market disruptions the requirements imposed by the company’s regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets the safety and soundness of financial institutions and the protection of clients these regulations often serve to limit the company’s activities by way of capital customer protection and market conduct requirements and restrictions on the businesses in which the company may operate despite the company’s efforts to comply with applicable regulations there are a number of risks particularly in areas where applicable regulations may be unclear or where regulators revise their previous guidance any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by the company’s regulators against the company or its affiliates officers or employees could result in fines penalties cease and desist orders enforcement actions or suspension or expulsion any of which could harm the company’s reputation and adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively impact the company’s business and financial results 

  

new legislation rule changes or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal state and sro rules and regulations may directly affect the operation and profitability of the company or its specific business lines the profitability of the company could also be affected by rules and regulations which impact the business and financial communities generally including changes to the laws governing taxation electronic commerce client privacy and security of client data 

  

the company’s industry is characterized by aggressive price competition 

  

the company continually monitors its pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjusts trade commission rates interest rates on deposits and loans fees for advisory services and other fee structures to enhance its competitive position increased price competition from other financial services firms such as reduced commissions to attract trading volume or higher deposit rates to attract client cash balances could impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

the industry in which the company competes has undergone a period of consolidation 

  

the company faces intense competition for the clients that it serves and the products and services it offers there has been significant consolidation as financial institutions with which the company competes have been acquired by or merged into or acquired other firms this consolidation may continue competition is based on many factors including the range of products and services offered pricing customer service brand recognition reputation and perceived financial strength consolidations may enable other firms to offer a broader range of products and services than the company does or offer such products at more competitive prices 

  

the company faces competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees especially for employees who are key to the company’s ability to build and enhance client relationships 

  

the market for quality professionals and other personnel in the company’s business is highly competitive competition is particularly strong for financial consultants who build and sustain the company’s client relationships the company’s ability 

  

 9  

the charles schwab corporation 

  

to continue to compete effectively will depend upon its ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs 

  

technology and operational failures could subject the company to losses litigation and regulatory actions 

  

the company faces technology and operating risk which is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems of the company or its vendors that constrain the company’s ability to gather process and communicate information and process client transactions efficiently and securely without interruptions this risk also includes the risk of human error employee misconduct external fraud computer viruses terrorist attacks and natural disaster the company’s business and operations could be negatively impacted by any significant technology and operational failures moreover instances of fraud or other misconduct including improper use or disclosure of confidential client employee or company information might also negatively impact the company’s reputation and client confidence in the company in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances despite the company’s efforts to identify areas of risk oversee operational areas involving risk and implement policies and procedures designed to manage risk there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer unexpected losses reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures including those of its vendors 

  

the company also faces risk related to its security guarantee which covers client losses from unauthorized account activity such as those caused by external fraud involving the compromise of clients’ login and password information losses reimbursed under the guarantee could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations 

  

the company relies on outsourced service providers to perform key functions 

  

the company relies on service providers to perform certain key technology processing and support functions these service providers also face technology and operating risk and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of the company’s confidential client employee or company information could cause the company to incur losses and could harm the company’s reputation the company also faces the risk that a service provider could without adequate notice cease to provide services which could disrupt the company’s operations switching to an alternative service provider may also require a transition period and result in less efficient operations 

  

potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on the company’s financial position 

  

the company evaluates potential strategic transactions including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions any such transaction could have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows the process of evaluating negotiating and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert management’s attention from other business concerns and might cause the loss of key clients employees and business partners moreover integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties including the need to integrate operational financial and management information systems and management controls integrate relationships with clients and business partners and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas in addition an acquisition may cause the company to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation further the company may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition and any future acquisition could be dilutive to the company’s current stockholders’ percentage ownership or to earnings per share eps 

  

the company’s acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business operations or financial condition of the entity being acquired or sold to the extent the company enters into an agreement to buy or sell an entity there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected or at all if a material transaction does not close the company’s stock price could decline 

  

the company’s stock price has fluctuated historically and may continue to fluctuate 

  

the company’s stock price can be volatile among the factors that may affect the company’s stock price are the following

2008 compared to 2007 

  

2008 was marked by extraordinary market conditions including continued downward pressure on home prices tighter credit markets liquidity concerns significant volatility and sharp declines in the equity markets and continued slowing of general economic activity the nasdaq composite index standard and poor’s 500 index and the dow jones industrial average decreased during the year by 41 38 and 34 respectively with a significant portion of these decreases occurring in the fourth quarter in addition the federal funds rate decreased during the year by 425 to a range of zero to 025 at december 31 2008

net revenues grew by 16 in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase in asset management and administration fees driven by growth in client assets as well as an increase in net interest revenue due to higher interest rate spreads expenses excluding interest increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense advertising and market development expense and professional services expense the company’s pretax profit margin from continuing operations was 371 in 2007 as compared to 343 in 2006 due to revenue growth and disciplined expense management during the year return on stockholders’ equity increased to 55 in 2007 as compared to 26 in 2006 reflecting the sale of us trust earnings growth and the company’s active management of its capital base net revenue per average fulltime equivalent employee was 387000 in 2007 up 7 from 2006 due to revenue growth partially offset by the increase in average fulltime equivalent employees as a result of the acquisition of the 401k company

current market environment 

  

the adverse market conditions in 2008 discussed above continue to negatively impact the company’s revenues 

  

the company earns mutual fund service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the company continued depressed equity valuations in 2009 will negatively impact asset management and administration fees on a yearoveryear basis additionally mutual fund service fees may be further reduced if the current interest rate environment persists to the extent certain money market mutual funds replace maturing securities with lower yielding securities and the overall yield on such funds falls to a level at or below the management fees on those funds the company may waive a portion of its fee in order to continue providing some return to clients 

  

with the recent decline in interest rates the company’s revenue from interestearning assets such as securities held and loans to clients has been declining more than the rates that the company pays on funding sources such as customer deposits the company’s ability to reduce those rates has been limited as short term rates have approached zero if the current interest rate environment persists through 2009 it will negatively impact net interest revenue on a yearoveryear basis 

  

the level at which clients utilize margin loans will also impact net interest revenue while the average balance of margin loans was 103 billion for all of 2008 by monthend december the balance had declined to 62 billion 

  

the company recorded pretax losses of 75 million related to two corporate debt securities in its securities available for sale portfolio in 2008 certain securities available for sale experienced deteriorating credit characteristics in 2008 further deterioration in the performance of these securities including nonagency mortgagebacked securities could result in the recognition of future impairment charges

net revenues 

  

the company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees net interest revenue and trading revenue asset management and administration fees were relatively flat while net interest revenue and trading revenue increased in 2008 as compared to 2007 asset management and administration fees net interest revenue and trading revenue increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 

  

  

   

asset management and administration fees 

  

asset management and administration fees include mutual fund service fees and fees for other assetbased financial services provided to individual and institutional clients the company earns mutual fund service fees for transfer agent services shareholder services administration and investment management provided to its proprietary funds and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to thirdparty funds these fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in thirdparty funds and the company’s proprietary funds the company also earns asset management fees for advisory and managed account services which are based on the daily balances of client assets subject to the specific fee for service the fair values of client assets which include proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data asset management and administration fees may vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and levels of net new client assets for discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees see “current market environment” 

  

asset management and administration fees remained relatively flat in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to lower thirdparty mutual fund and advisory service fees partially offset by higher proprietary fund fees mutual fund onesource service fees decreased by 77 million or 12 in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to a 39 decline in schwab’s mutual fund onesource asset balances the company’s proprietary mutual fund service fees increased 98 million or 8 in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to a 15 increase in money market mutual fund asset balances investment management and trust fees decreased by 38 million or 10 in 2008 from 2007 due to lower balances of client assets participating in advisory and managed account services programs

from 2006 primarily due to a 26 rise in the company’s proprietary mutual fund asset balances and an 11 increase in asset balances in schwab’s mutual fund onesource service investment management and trust fees increased by 68 million or 22 in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to higher balances of client assets participating in advisory and managed account services programs 

  

net interest revenue 

  

net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on funding sources net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies the company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall ie interestearning assets generally reprice more quickly than interestbearing liabilities in the event of falling interest rates the company might attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lockin asset yields as well as by lowering rates paid to clients on interestbearing liabilities since the company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients as well as the rates charged on receivables from brokerage clients and also controls the composition of its investment securities it has some ability to manage its net interest spread however the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition for discussion of the impact of current market conditions on net interest revenue see “current market environment” 

  

in clearing its clients’ trades schwab holds cash balances payable to clients in most cases schwab pays its clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment and may invest these funds and earn interest revenue receivables from brokerage clients consist primarily of margin loans to brokerage clients margin loans are loans made by schwab to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities pursuant to sec regulations client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients 

  

when investing segregated client cash balances schwab must adhere to sec regulations that restrict investments to securities guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the us government participation certificates mortgagebacked securities guaranteed by the government national mortgage association certificates of deposit issued by us banks and thrifts and resale agreements collateralized by qualified securities additionally schwab has established policies for the minimum credit quality and maximum maturity of these investments schwab bank also maintains investment portfolios for liquidity as well as to invest funding from deposits raised in excess of loans to banking clients schwab bank’s securities available for sale include mortgagebacked securities corporate debt securities certificates of deposit assetbacked securities and us agency notes schwab bank’s securities held to maturity include assetbacked securities schwab bank lends funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans these loans are largely funded by interestbearing deposits from banking clients 

  

the company’s interestearning assets are financed primarily by brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients other funding sources include noninterestbearing brokerage client cash balances and proceeds from stocklending activities as well as stockholders’ equity 

  

the amount of excess cash held in certain schwab brokerage client accounts that is swept into money market deposit accounts at schwab bank and through may 2007 at us trust has increased significantly since the program’s inception in 2003 average interestbearing banking deposits increased 72 billion or 59 to 192 billion in 2008 from 2007 and 29 billion or 32 to 120 billion in 2007 from 2006 as a result the average securities available for sale balances increased 44 billion or 60 to 118 billion in 2008 from 2007 and 12 billion or 20 to 73 billion in 2007 from 2006 while the average balance of loans to banking clients increased 20 billion or 73 to 48 billion in 2008 from 2007 and 629 million or 29 to 28 billion in 2007 from 2006

the following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interestearning assets and funding sources on the consolidated balance sheet 

  

  

   

   

the increases in net interest revenue in the last two years were primarily due to higher average interestearning assets including increases in securities available for sale and loans to banking clients partially offset by higher average balances on deposits from banking clients in addition the increase in net interest revenue in 2008 was also partially offset by a decrease in receivables from brokerage clients as well as generally lower yields on interestearning assets net interest revenue in 2007 included incremental interest revenue generated from temporarily investing the proceeds from the sale of us trust consistent with declines in general market interest rates prevalent in 2008 the company experienced declines in the yields of all interestearning assets during 2008 as compared to 2007 and 2006 accordingly the average interest rates on deposits from banking clients and payables to brokerage clients also decreased during 2008 compared to 2007 and 2006 the decline in the average interest rate on longterm debt was due to the additional debt issued at lower interest rates as part of the company’s capital restructuring in 2007 

  

certain interestbearing assets and liabilities of us trust retained by the company in 2007 and 2006 the excess cash held in certain schwab brokerage client accounts was previously swept into a money market deposit account at us trust in may 2007 schwab terminated this arrangement and moved all of these balances to a similar existing arrangement with schwab bank the interest expense related to these client deposit balances maintained at us trust is included in interest expense from continuing operations on the company’s consolidated statements of income for 2007 and 2006 the interest expense was 4 million and 11 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively the corresponding interest revenue on the invested cash balances related to these deposits is included in interest revenue from continuing operations on the company’s consolidated statements of income for 2007 and 2006 the interest revenue was 14 million and 38 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively the interest revenue amount was calculated using the company’s funds transfer pricing methodology

other revenue 

  

other revenue includes realized gains and losses on sales of securities available for sale service fees and software maintenance fees other revenue decreased by 79 million or 61 in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to losses of 75 million related to two corporate debt securities in the company’s securities available for sale portfolio in 2008 on september 15 2008 lehman brothers holdings inc lehman filed a chapter 11 bankruptcy petition and on september 25 2008 the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic seized washington mutual bank as a result of these events the company sold these debt securities in 2008 

  

expenses excluding interest

csc is a savings and loan holding company and schwab bank csc’s depository institution is a federal savings bank csc and schwab bank are both subject to supervision and regulation by the office of thrift supervision 

  

liquidity 

  

csc 

  

as a savings and loan holding company csc is not subject to specific statutory capital requirements however csc is required to maintain capital that is sufficient to support the holding company and its subsidiaries’ business activities and the risks inherent in those activities to manage capital adequacy csc currently utilizes a target tier 1 leverage ratio as defined by the board of governors of the federal reserve board of at least 6 at december 31 2008 csc’s tier 1 leverage ratio was 86 

  

csc’s liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries as well as cash provided by external financing csc maintains excess liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits to cover daily funding needs and to support growth in the company’s business generally csc does not hold liquidity at its subsidiaries in excess of amounts deemed sufficient to support the subsidiaries’ operations including any regulatory capital requirements schwab and schwab bank are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with csc management believes that funds generated by the operations of csc’s subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting csc’s liquidity needs providing adequate liquidity to meet schwab bank’s capital guidelines and maintaining schwab’s net capital 

  

csc has liquidity needs that arise from its senior mediumterm notes series a mediumterm notes and junior subordinated notes as well as from the funding of cash dividends acquisitions and other investments the mediumterm notes of which 458 million was outstanding at december 31 2008 have maturities ranging from 2009 to 2017 and fixed interest rates ranging from 6375 to 805 with interest payable semiannually the mediumterm notes are rated a2 by moody’s investors service moody’s a by standard  poor’s ratings group sp and a by fitch ibca inc fitch at december 31 2008 300 million of junior subordinated notes were outstanding and have a fixed interest rate of 750 until 2017 and a floating rate thereafter the junior subordinated notes are not rated however the trust preferred securities related to these notes are rated a3 by moody’s bbb by sp and a by fitch for further discussion of the issuance of the junior subordinated notes see “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – 12 borrowings”

csc has authorization from its board of directors to issue unsecured commercial paper notes commercial paper notes not to exceed 15 billion management has set a current limit for the commercial paper program of 800 million the maturities of the commercial paper notes may vary but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue the commercial paper is not redeemable prior to maturity and is not subject to voluntary prepayment the proceeds of the commercial paper program are to be used for general corporate purposes csc commenced issuing commercial paper notes in april 2008 average borrowings for the year ended december 31 2008 were 40 million there were no commercial paper notes outstanding at december 31 2008 csc’s ratings for these shortterm borrowings are p1 by moody’s a1 by sp and f1 by fitch 

  

csc maintains an 800 million committed unsecured credit facility with a group of fourteen banks which is scheduled to expire in june 2009 csc plans to establish a similar facility to replace this one when it expires this facility was unused in 2008 any issuances under csc’s commercial paper program will reduce the amount available under this facility the funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes including repayment of the commercial paper notes discussed above the financial covenants under this facility require schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio as defined schwab bank to be well capitalized as defined and csc to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity at december 31 2008 the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was 26 billion management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on its ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements 

  

csc also has direct access to 10 billion of the 11 billion uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines discussed below that are primarily utilized by schwab to manage shortterm liquidity the amount available to csc under these lines is lower than the amount available to schwab because the credit line provided by one of these banks is only available to schwab these lines were not used by csc in 2008 

  

in addition schwab provides csc with a 10 billion credit facility maturing in 2009 no funds were drawn under this facility at december 31 2008 

  

schwab 

  

schwab is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of brokerdealers these regulations prohibit schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings to csc paying cash dividends or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent or employees if such payment would result in net capital of less than 5 of aggregate debit balances or less than 120 of its minimum dollar requirement of 250000 at december 31 2008 schwab’s net capital was 12 billion 16 of aggregate debit balances which was 11 billion in excess of its minimum required net capital and 840 million in excess of 5 of aggregate debit balances 

  

most of schwab’s assets are readily convertible to cash consisting primarily of shortterm ie less than 150 days investmentgrade interestearning investments the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements receivables from brokerage clients and receivables from brokers dealers and clearing organizations client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities receivables from and payables to brokers dealers and clearing organizations primarily represent current open transactions which usually settle or can be closed out within a few business days 

  

liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts which were 192 billion 195 billion and 199 billion at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for schwab in the future 

  

the company has a finance lease obligation related to an office building and land under a 20year lease the remaining finance lease obligation of 116 million at december 31 2008 is being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term of approximately 16 years 

  

to manage shortterm liquidity schwab maintains uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines with a group of six banks totaling 11 billion at december 31 2008 the need for shortterm borrowings arises primarily from timing differences

the evaluation of whether otherthantemporary impairment exists is a matter of judgment the evaluation includes the assessment of several factors including 1 whether the unrealized loss is solely due to changes in interest rates 2 the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost 3 the financial condition of the issuer if applicable 4 the credit ratings of the issuer or security 5 the credit characteristics of the collateral underlying the security including the credit default experience delinquency rates cumulative losses to date and the ratio of credit enhancement available under the terms of the security to expected losses for nonagency mortgagebacked securities and 6 the company’s intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery additionally management utilizes cash flow models for securities that exhibit deteriorating credit characteristics to estimate the expected cash flow from the securities in order to assess whether it is probable that the company will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the security these cash flow models require management to estimate future principal prepayments default rates and default loss severities based on underlying collateral and future housing price changes further deterioration of these characteristics could result in the recognition of otherthantemporary impairment

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

market risk is the potential for changes in revenue or the value of financial instruments held by the company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or market conditions 

  

for the company’s market risk related to interest rates a sensitivity analysis referred to as a net interest revenue simulation model is shown below the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interestearning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources which finance these assets 

  

net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interest bearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and long term interest rates interest earningassets include residential real estate loans and mortgage backed securities these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and to changes to prepayment levels which tend to increase in a declining rate environment 

  

to mitigate the risk of loss the company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interestearning assets and funding sources to remain within these guidelines the company manages the maturity repricing and cash flow characteristics of its investment portfolios because the company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients the rates charged on margin loans and controls the composition of its investment securities it has some ability to manage its net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions 

  

the company is also subject to market risk as a result of fluctuations in equity prices the company’s direct holdings of equity securities and its associated exposure to equity prices are not material the company is indirectly exposed to equity market fluctuations in connection with securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers and customer securities loaned out as part of the company’s securities lending activities equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity margin borrowing and overall client engagement with the company additionally the company earns mutual fund service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the company 

  

financial instruments held by the company are also subject to liquidity risk – that is the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument recent conditions in the credit markets have significantly reduced market liquidity in a wide range of financial instruments including the types of instruments held by the company and fair value can differ significantly from the value implied by the credit quality and actual performance of the instrument’s underlying cash flows 

  

financial instruments held by the company are also subject to valuation risk as a result of changes in valuations of the underlying collateral such as housing prices in the case of residential real estate loans and mortgagebacked securities 

  

for discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees net interest and securities available for sale see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – current market environment” 

  

the company’s market risk related to financial instruments held for trading interest rate swaps related to a portion of its fixed interest rate mediumterm notes and forward sale and interest rate lock commitments related to its loans held for sale portfolio is not material 

  

net interest revenue simulation 

  

the company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulation model the model includes all interestsensitive assets and liabilities as well as interest rate swap agreements utilized by the company to hedge its interest rate risk key variables in the model include the repricing of financial instruments prepayment and reinvestment assumptions and product pricing assumptions the company uses

the charles schwab corporation 

  

constant balances and market rates in the model assumptions in order to minimize the number of variables and to better isolate risks the simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and as a result cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies including changes in asset and liability mix 

  

as represented by the simulations presented below the company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall ie interestearning assets generally reprice more quickly than interestbearing liabilities 

  

the simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as the company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood the company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the results of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to the company’s current market rates forecast on simulated net interest revenue over the next 12 months at december 31 2008 and 2007 while the company typically uses a gradual 200 basis point change it revised the methodology at march 31 2008 due to the current low levels of interest rates the company will use a gradual 100 basis point change until such time as the level of interest rates justifies a return to the previous methodology 

  

   

the sensitivity shown in the 100 basis point decrease scenario reflects the fact that the rates paid on brokerage client cash balances and banking deposits had reached minimal levels by yearend 2008 with liability costs essentially fixed lower rates earned on interestbearing assets would have a direct impact on net interest income the company remains positioned to experience increases in net interest revenue as rates rise and decreases as rates fall

regulation 

  

on november 15 2007 schwab bank converted its charter from a national association to a federal savings bank as a result of this conversion csc became a savings and loan holding company as a federal savings bank and savings and loan holding company respectively schwab bank and csc are both subject to supervision and regulation by the office of thrift supervision ots prior to the conversion csc was a financial holding company which is a type of bank holding company subject to supervision and regulation by the federal reserve board under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended and schwab bank was a national association subject to supervision and regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency

csc is required to maintain capital that is sufficient to support the holding company and its subsidiaries’ business activities and the risks inherent in those activities schwab bank is required to maintain a capital level that at least equals minimum capital levels specified in federal banking laws and regulations failure to meet the minimum levels will result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on the bank 

  

the securities industry in the united states is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws schwab and 401k investment services inc a subsidiary of the 401k companies inc are registered as brokerdealers with the securities and exchange commission sec the fifty states and the district of columbia and puerto rico schwab and csim are registered as investment advisors with the sec additionally schwab is regulated by the commodities futures trading commission cftc with respect to the futures and commodities trading activities it conducts as an introducing broker 

  

much of the regulation of brokerdealers has been delegated to selfregulatory organizations sros namely the national securities exchanges financial industry regulatory authority inc finra resulting from the consolidation of the national association of securities dealers nasd and new york stock exchange member regulation and the municipal securities rulemaking board msrb schwab is a member of several national securities exchanges and is consequently subject to their rules and regulations the primary regulators of schwab and 401k investment services inc are finra and for municipal securities the msrb the cftc has

the charles schwab corporation 

  

designated the national futures association nfa as schwab’s primary regulator for futures and commodities trading activities the company’s business is also subject to oversight by regulatory bodies in other countries in which the company operates 

  

the principal purpose of regulating brokerdealers and investment advisors is the protection of clients and the securities markets the regulations to which brokerdealers and investment advisors are subject cover all aspects of the securities business including among other things sales and trading practices publication of research margin lending uses and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities capital adequacy recordkeeping and reporting fee arrangements disclosure to clients fiduciary duties owed to advisory clients and the conduct of directors officers and employees 

  

as registered brokerdealers schwab and 401k investment services inc are subject to sec rule 15c31 the uniform net capital rule and related sro requirements the cftc and nfa also impose net capital requirements the uniform net capital rule specifies minimum capital requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of brokerdealers because csc itself is not a registered brokerdealer it is not subject to the uniform net capital rule however if schwab failed to maintain specified levels of net capital such failure would constitute a default by csc under certain debt covenants 

  

the uniform net capital rule limits brokerdealers’ ability to transfer capital to parent companies and other affiliates compliance with the net capital rule could limit schwab’s operations and its ability to repay subordinated debt to csc which in turn could limit csc’s ability to repay debt pay cash dividends and purchase shares of its outstanding stock

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

the company faces a variety of risks that may affect its operations or financial results and many of those risks are driven by factors that the company cannot control or predict the following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant although there may be other risks that could arise or may prove to be more significant than expected that may affect the company’s operations or financial results 

  

for a discussion of the company’s risk management including technology and operating risk credit risk concentration risk and legal and regulatory risk see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – risk management” 

  

developments in the business economic and geopolitical environment could negatively impact the company’s business 

  

the company’s business can be adversely affected by the general environment – economic corporate securities market regulatory and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations trading activity interest rates and overall investor engagement and are outside of the company’s control the recent deterioration in the housing and credit markets decline of shortterm interest rates and significant securities market volatility could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

a significant decrease in the company’s liquidity could negatively affect the company’s business and financial management as well as reduce client confidence in the company 

  

maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to the business operations of the company including margin lending mortgage lending and transaction settlement among other liquidity needs also a reduction in csc’s liquidity position could adversely affect csc’s ability to repay debt pay cash dividends and repurchase shares of its stock if the company’s brokerdealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to csc any such limitations could have an adverse effect on csc which depends primarily on cash generated by its subsidiaries in order to fulfill its debt service obligations and otherwise meet its liquidity needs in addition a reduction in the company’s liquidity position could reduce client confidence in the company which could result in the loss of client accounts the company attempts to manage liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient liquid financial resources to fund its balance sheet and meet its obligations the company meets its liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by operations as well as cash provided by external financing fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances as well as changes in market conditions may affect the company’s ability to meet its liquidity needs 

  

specific risk factors which may adversely affect the company’s liquidity position include 

  

   

   

   

significant interest rate changes could affect the company’s profitability and financial condition 

  

the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interestearning assets such as margin loans customer mortgages and securities and its funding sources such as customer deposits and company borrowings changes in interest rates generally affect the interest earned on interestearning assets differently than the interest the company pays on its interestbearing liabilities overall the company is positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment the company could be adversely affected by a decline in interest rates if the rates that the company earns on interestearning assets decline more than the rates that the company pays on interestbearing liabilities or if prepayment rates increase on the mortgages and mortgagebacked securities that the company holds the company may also be limited in the amount it can reduce interest rates on deposit accounts and still offer a competitive return in the event prevailing shortterm

the charles schwab corporation 

  

interest rates declined to the point where yields available on money market mutual funds approached the level of management fees on those funds the company could find itself in the position of having to reduce its management fees so that it could continue to pay clients a competitive return on their assets 

  

the company may suffer significant losses from its credit exposures 

  

the company’s businesses are subject to the risk that a client or counterparty will fail to perform its contractual obligations or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate while the company has policies and procedures designed to manage this risk the policies and procedures may not be fully effective the company’s exposure mainly results from margin lending activities securities lending activities mortgage lending activities its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds that the company sponsors 

  

the company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale portfolio which includes us agency and nonagency collateralized mortgage obligations and corporate debt securities among other investments the company’s loans to banking clients primarily consist of firstlien mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit housing price declines increases in delinquency and default rates changes in the interest rate environment and other economic factors can result in writedowns on such loans and the loss of value of securities available for sale 

  

heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments concentration risk can increase the company’s risk of loss examples of the company’s credit concentration risk include 

  

   

   

   

the company may also be subject to concentration risk when lending to a particular counterparty borrower or issuer 

  

the company sponsors a number of proprietary money market funds during 2007 several financial institutions provided credit or liquidity support for their sponsored money market funds although the company has no obligation to do so the company could decide for competitive reasons to provide credit or liquidity support to its funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings such support could cause the company to take significant charges and could reduce the company’s liquidity if the company chose not to provide credit or liquidity support in such a situation the company could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected  

  

the company’s industry is characterized by aggressive price competition 

  

the company continually monitors its pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjusts commission rates interest rates and other fee structures to enhance its competitive position increased competition including pricing pressure could harm the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

the industry in which the company competes has undergone a period of consolidation 

  

the company faces intense competition for the clients that it serves and the products and services it offers there has been significant consolidation as financial institutions with which the company competes have been acquired by or merged into or acquired other firms this consolidation may continue competition is based on many factors including the range of products and services offered pricing customer service brand recognition reputation and perceived financial strength consolidations may enable other firms to offer a broader range of products and services than the company does or offer such products at more competitive prices

the charles schwab corporation 

  

the company faces intense competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees especially for employees who are key to the company’s ability to build and enhance client relationships 

  

the market for quality professionals and other personnel in the company’s business is highly competitive competition is particularly strong for financial consultants who build and sustain the company’s client relationships the company’s ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon its ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs 

  

technology and operational failures could subject the company to losses litigation and regulatory actions 

  

the company faces technology and operating risk which is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems of the company or its vendors that constrain the company’s ability to gather process and communicate information and process client transactions efficiently and securely without interruptions this risk also includes the risk of human error employee misconduct external fraud computer viruses terrorist attacks and natural disaster the company’s business and operations could be negatively impacted by any significant technology and operational failures moreover instances of fraud or other misconduct including improper use or disclosure of confidential client employee or company information might also negatively impact the company’s reputation and client confidence in the company in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances despite the company’s efforts to identify areas of risk oversee operational areas involving risk and implement policies and procedures designed to manage risk there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer unexpected losses reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures including those of its vendors 

  

the company also faces risk related to its security guarantee which covers client losses from unauthorized account activity such as those caused by external fraud involving the compromise of clients’ login and password information losses reimbursed under the guarantee could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations 

  

the company relies on outsourced service providers to perform key functions 

  

the company relies on service providers to perform certain key technology processing and support functions these service providers also face technology and operating risk and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of the company’s confidential client employee or company information could cause the company to incur losses and could harm the company’s reputation the company also faces the risk that a service provider could without adequate notice cease to provide services which could disrupt the company’s operations switching to an alternative service provider may also require a transition period and result in less efficient operations 

  

potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on the company’s financial position 

  

the company evaluates potential strategic transactions including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions any such transaction could have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows the process of evaluating negotiating and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert management’s attention from other business concerns and might cause the loss of key clients employees and business partners moreover integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties including the need to integrate operational financial and management information systems and management controls integrate relationships with clients and business partners and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas in addition an acquisition may cause the company to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation further the company may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition and any future acquisition could be dilutive to the company’s current stockholders’ percentage ownership or to earnings per share eps

the charles schwab corporation 

  

the company’s acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business operations or financial condition of the entity being acquired or sold to the extent the company enters into an agreement to buy or sell an entity there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected or at all if a material transaction does not close the company’s stock price could decline 

  

extensive regulation of the company’s businesses limits the company’s activities and may subject it to significant penalties 

  

as a participant in the securities banking and financial services industries the company is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws by governmental agencies supervisory authorities and sros such regulation continues to become more extensive and complex the requirements imposed by the company’s regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets the safety and soundness of financial institutions and the protection of clients these regulations often serve to limit the company’s activities by way of capital customer protection and market conduct requirements and restrictions on the businesses in which the company may operate despite the company’s efforts to comply with applicable regulations there are a number of risks particularly in areas where applicable regulations may be unclear or where regulators revise their previous guidance any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by the company’s regulators against the company or its affiliates officers or employees could result in fines penalties cease and desist orders enforcement actions or suspension or expulsion any of which could harm the company’s reputation and adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively impact the company’s business and financial results 

  

new legislation rule changes or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal state and sro rules and regulations may directly affect the operation and profitability of the company or its specific business lines the profitability of the company could also be affected by rules and regulations which impact the business and financial communities generally including changes to the laws governing taxation electronic commerce client privacy and security of client data 

  

in the ordinary course of business the company is subject to litigation and may not always be successful in defending itself against such claims 

  

the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business which can result in settlements awards and injunctions it is inherently difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters particularly in cases in which claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages and a substantial judgment settlement fine or penalty could be material to the company’s operating results or cash flows for a particular future period depending on the company’s results for that period 

  

from time to time the company is subject to litigation claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights eg patents such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources if the company was found to have infringed a thirdparty patent or other intellectual property rights it could incur substantial liability and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology or providing certain products or services 

  

the company’s stock price has fluctuated historically and may continue to fluctuate 

  

the company’s stock price can be volatile among the factors that may affect the company’s stock price are the following

the company believes it has strong defenses in all significant matters currently pending and is vigorously contesting liability and the damages claimed nevertheless some of these matters may result in adverse judgments or awards including penalties injunctions or other relief and the company may also determine to settle a matter because of the uncertainty and risks of litigation predicting the outcome of a matter is inherently difficult particularly where claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages or when investigations or legal proceedings are at an early stage in many cases including those matters described below it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred or to estimate the range of that loss until the matter is close to resolution

however based on current information and consultation with counsel management believes that the resolution of matters currently pending including those described below will not have a material adverse impact on the financial condition or cash flows of the company but could be material to the company’s operating results for a particular future period depending on results for that period

asset management and administration fees 

  

asset management and administration fees include mutual fund service fees as well as fees for other assetbased financial services provided to individual and institutional clients the company earns mutual fund service fees for transfer agent services shareholder services administration and investment management provided to its proprietary funds and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to thirdparty funds these fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in thirdparty funds and the company’s proprietary funds the company also earns asset management fees for advisory and managed account services which are based on the daily balances of client assets subject to the specific fee for service the fair values of client assets which include proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data asset management and administration fees may vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and levels of net new client assets 

  

the increase in asset management and administration fees from 2005 to 2007 was primarily due to higher mutual fund advisory and managed account asset balances the 329 million or 21 increase in mutual fund service fees from 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to a 26 rise in the company’s proprietary mutual fund asset balances and an 11 increase in asset balances in schwab’s mutual fund onesource service the 221 million or 16 increase in mutual fund service fees from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to a 28 rise in the company’s proprietary mutual fund asset balances and an 18 increase in asset balances in schwab’s mutual fund onesource service the 68 million or 22 and 82 million or 36 increase in investment management and trust fees from 2006 to 2007 and 2005 to 2006 respectively was primarily due to higher balances of client assets participating in advisory and managed account services programs at december 31 2007 the company’s total client assets increased 2063 billion or 17 from december 31 2006 due to 1602 billion of net new client assets and 461 billion of net market gains at december 31 2006 the company’s total client assets increased 1857 billion or 18 from december 31 2005 due to 833 billion of net new client assets and 1024 billion of net market gains 

  

net interest revenue 

  

net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on certain assets mainly margin loans to clients investments of segregated client cash balances loans to banking clients and securities available for sale and interest paid on supporting liabilities mainly deposits from banking clients and brokerage client cash balances net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies the company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall ie interestearning assets generally reprice more quickly than interestbearing liabilities in the event of falling interest rates the company might attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lockin asset yields as well as by lowering rates paid to clients on interestbearing liabilities the company’s flexibility in repricing these liabilities is increasingly constrained as short term rates approach zero 

  

in clearing its clients’ trades schwab holds cash balances payable to clients in most cases schwab pays its clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment and may invest these funds and earn interest revenue margin loans arise when schwab lends funds to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities pursuant to sec regulations client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients 

  

when investing segregated client cash balances schwab must adhere to sec regulations that restrict investments to us government securities participation certificates mortgagebacked securities guaranteed by the government national mortgage association certificates of deposit issued by us banks and thrifts and resale agreements collateralized by qualified securities schwab’s policies for credit quality and maximum maturity

requirements are more restrictive than these sec regulations schwab bank also maintains investment portfolios for liquidity as well as to invest funding from deposits raised in excess of loans to clients schwab bank invests in securities available for sale including commercial paper collateralized mortgage obligations cmos corporate debt and us government securities schwab bank lends funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans these loans are largely funded by interestbearing deposits from banking clients 

  

the company’s interestearning assets are financed primarily by interestbearing brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients other funding sources include noninterestbearing brokerage client cash balances proceeds from stocklending activities and longterm debt as well as stockholders’ equity clientrelated daily average balances interest rates and average net interest spread are summarized as follows 

  

  

   

   

the increases in net interest revenue in the last two years were primarily due to changes in the composition of interestearning assets including increases in securities available for sale loans to banking clients and margin loan balances as well as generally higher yields on earning assets partially offset by higher average balances on banking deposits 

  

since the company establishes the rates paid on brokerage client cash balances and certain banking deposits and the rates charged on margin loans it has some ability to manage its net interest spread however the spread

the increases in compensation and benefits expense from 2005 to 2007 were primarily due to an increase in fulltime equivalent employees and higher levels of incentive compensation the following table shows a comparison of certain compensation and benefits components and employee data 

  

  

    

the increases in incentive compensation expense from 2005 to 2007 were primarily due to the increased cost of performancebased incentive plans as a result of the company’s improved financial results and stockbased compensation 

  

for 2007 net revenue growth outpaced compensation and benefits expense growth resulting in a declining ratio of compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total net revenues 

  

expenses excluding compensation and benefits 

  

the increases in professional services expense from 2005 to 2007 were primarily due to higher levels of fees paid to outsourced service providers and consultants the increase in occupancy and equipment expense from 2006 to 2007 was due to increases in data processing equipment and maintenance expense of 17 million and occupancy expense of 5 million the increases in advertising and market development expense from 2005 to 2007 were primarily due to the company’s media and marketing spending related to its “talk to chuck™” national advertising campaign during 2006 and 2007 the increase in communications expense from 2006 to 2007 was due to higher levels of postage and printing costs of 15 million and news and quotes services of 5 million other expenses increased from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to increases in regulatory fees of 7 million bank service charges of 7 million and charitable contributions of 4 million

as a savings and loan holding company csc is not subject to the consolidated regulatory capital guidelines applicable to a financial holding company csc is required to maintain capital that is sufficient to support the holding company and its subsidiaries’ business activities and the risks inherent in those activities to manage capital adequacy csc currently utilizes a target tier 1 leverage ratio as defined by the federal reserve board of at least 6 as csc’s depository institution subsidiary schwab bank is required to maintain a capital level that at least equals minimum capital levels specified in federal banking laws and regulations failure to meet the minimum levels will result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that if undertaken could have a direct effect on the bank based on its regulatory capital ratios at december 31 2007 and 2006 schwab bank is considered well capitalized 

  

liquidity 

  

csc 

  

csc’s liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries as well as cash provided by external financing schwab and schwab bank are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with csc management believes that funds generated by the operations of csc’s subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting csc’s liquidity needs providing adequate liquidity to meet schwab bank’s capital guidelines and maintaining schwab’s net capital 

  

csc has liquidity needs that arise from its senior mediumterm notes series a mediumterm notes as well as from the funding of cash dividends acquisitions and other investments in september 2007 csc issued 250 million of 6375 mediumterm notes due in 2017 the mediumterm notes of which 473 million was outstanding at december 31 2007 have maturities ranging from 2008 to 2017 and fixed interest rates ranging from 638 to 805 with interest payable semiannually the mediumterm notes are rated a2 by moody’s investors service moody’s a by standard  poor’s ratings group sp and a by fitch ibca inc fitch

available under this facility the funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes and csc pays a commitment fee on the unused balance of this facility the financial covenants in this facility require csc to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio as defined and schwab bank to be well capitalized as defined management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on its ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements 

  

csc also has direct access to 811 million of the 861 million uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines provided by eight banks that are primarily utilized by schwab to manage shortterm liquidity the amount available to csc under these lines is lower than the amount available to schwab because the credit line provided by one of these banks is only available to schwab these lines were not used by csc in 2007

to manage shortterm liquidity schwab maintains uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines with a group of eight banks totaling 861 million at december 31 2007 the need for shortterm borrowings arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements scheduled liquidation of interestbearing investments and movements of cash to meet segregation requirements schwab used such borrowings for seventeen days in 2007 with daily amounts borrowed averaging 177 million there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at december 31 2007

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

market risk is the potential for loss due to a change in the value of a financial instrument held by the company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates or equity prices 

  

for the company’s market risk related to interest rate fluctuations it has disclosed below a sensitivity analysis referred to as a net interest revenue simulation model the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interestearning assets mainly margin loans to clients investments loans to banking clients mortgagebacked securities and other fixedrate investments and its funding sources including brokerage client cash balances banking deposits proceeds from stocklending activities and longterm debt which finance these assets to mitigate the risk of loss the company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk and by monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interestearning assets and funding sources to remain within these guidelines the company manages the maturity repricing and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios the company also has the ability to adjust the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and certain banking deposits and the rates charged on margin loans 

  

the company has market risk as a result of fluctuations in equity prices however the company’s exposure to equity prices is not material additionally the company’s market risk related to financial instruments held for trading financial instruments held for purposes other than trading interest rate swaps related to a portion of its fixed interest rate mediumterm notes and forward sale and interest rate lock commitments related to its loans held for sale portfolio is not material 

  

net interest revenue simulation 

  

the company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulation model the model includes all interestsensitive assets and liabilities as well as interest rate swap agreements utilized by the company to hedge its interest rate risk key variables in the model include the repricing of financial instruments prepayment and reinvestment assumptions and product pricing assumptions historically the company included additional variables eg changes in the balances of client loans deposits brokerage client cash and changes in the level and term structure of interest rates in the model assumptions effective in 2007 for all periods presented the company uses constant balances and market rates in the model assumptions in order to minimize the number of variables and to better isolate risks the simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and as a result cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies including changes in asset and liability mix 

  

as represented by the simulations presented below the company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall ie interestearning assets generally reprice more quickly than interestbearing liabilities 

  

the simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as the company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood the company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the results of a graduated 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates relative to the company’s current market rates forecast on simulated net interest revenue over the next twelve months at december 31 2007 and 2006

the simulations show an increase in exposure to rate changes at december 31 2007 from december 31 2006 and the company remains positioned to experience increases in net interest revenue as rates rise and decreases as rates fall

csc is a financial holding company which is a type of bank holding company subject to supervision and regulation by the federal reserve board under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended the act csc’s depository institution subsidiaries including schwab bank and affiliates of us trust currently reflected as a discontinued operation for financial statement purposes are subject to regulation and supervision and to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state laws including regulatory capital guidelines among other things these requirements govern transactions with csc and its nondepository institution subsidiaries including loans and other extensions of credit investments or asset purchases dividends and investments the federal banking agencies have broad powers to enforce these regulations including the power to terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver 

  

to maintain its status as a financial holding company each of csc’s depository institution subsidiaries must be kept “well capitalized” and “well managed” in addition each of csc’s insured depository institution subsidiaries must be rated “satisfactory” or better in meeting the requirements of the community reinvestment act of 1977 in order for csc to engage in new financial activities or enter into certain acquisitions of companies engaged in financial activities 

  

the securities industry in the united states is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws schwab and cybertrader are registered as brokerdealers with the securities and exchange commission sec the fifty states and the district of columbia and puerto rico schwab and csim are registered as investment advisors with the sec additionally schwab is regulated by the commodities futures trading commission cftc with respect to the futures and commodities trading activities it conducts as an introducing broker 

  

much of the regulation of brokerdealers has been delegated to selfregulatory organizations sros namely the national securities exchanges the national association of securities dealers nasd and the municipal securities rulemaking board msrb schwab is a member of several national securities exchanges and is consequently subject to their rules and regulations the primary regulators of schwab and cybertrader are the nasd and for municipal securities the msrb the cftc has designated the national futures association nfa as schwab’s primary regulator for futures and commodities trading activities the company’s business is also subject to oversight by regulatory bodies in other countries in which the company operates 

  

the principal purpose of regulating brokerdealers and investment advisors is the protection of clients and the securities markets the regulations to which brokerdealers and investment advisors are subject cover all aspects of the securities business including among other things sales and trading practices publication of research margin lending uses and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities capital adequacy recordkeeping and reporting fee arrangements disclosure to clients fiduciary duties owed to advisory clients and the conduct of directors officers and employees 

  

as registered brokerdealers certain subsidiaries of csc including schwab are subject to sec rule 15c31 the net capital rule and related sro requirements the cftc and nfa also impose net capital requirements the net capital rule specifies minimum capital requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of brokerdealers because csc itself is not a registered brokerdealer it is not subject to the net capital rule however if schwab failed to maintain specified levels of net capital such failure would constitute a default by csc under certain debt covenants 

  

the net capital rule limits brokerdealers’ ability to transfer capital to parent companies and other affiliates compliance with the net capital rule could limit schwab’s operations and its ability to repay subordinated debt to csc which in turn could limit csc’s ability to repay debt pay cash dividends and purchase shares of its outstanding stock

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

the company faces a variety of risks that may affect its operations or financial results and many of those risks are driven by factors that the company cannot control or predict the following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant although there may be other risks that could arise or may prove to be more significant than expected that may affect the company’s operations or financial results 

  

for a discussion of the company’s risk management including technology and operating risk and legal and regulatory risk see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – risk management” 

  

there has been aggressive price competition in the company’s industry which may continue in the future 

  

the company continually monitors its pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjusts commission rates interest rates and other fee structures to enhance its competitive position increased competition including pricing pressure could harm the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

the industry in which the company competes has undergone a period of consolidation and the company now faces stronger competitors 

  

the company faces intense competition for the clients that it serves and the products and services it offers there has been significant consolidation as financial institutions with which the company competes have been acquired by or merged into or acquired other firms this consolidation may continue competition is based on many factors including the range of products and services offered pricing customer service brand recognition reputation and perceived financial strength consolidations may enable other firms to offer a broader range of products and services than the company does or offer such products at more competitive prices

the company faces intense competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees especially for employees who are key to the company’s ability to build and enhance client relationships 

  

the market for quality professionals and other personnel in the company’s business is highly competitive competition is particularly strong for financial consultants who build and sustain the company’s client relationships the company’s ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon its ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs 

  

extensive regulation of the company’s businesses limits the company’s activities and may subject it to significant penalties 

  

as a participant in the securities and financial services industries the company is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws by governmental agencies supervisory authorities and sros such regulation continues to become more extensive and complex the requirements imposed by the company’s regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect clients these regulations often serve to limit the company’s activities by way of net capital customer protection and market conduct requirements and restrictions on the businesses in which the company may operate despite the company’s efforts to comply with applicable regulations there are a number of risks particularly in areas where applicable regulations may be unclear or where regulators revise their previous guidance any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by the company’s regulators against the company or its affiliates officers or employees could result in fines penalties cease and desist orders enforcement actions or suspension or expulsion any of which could harm the company’s reputation and adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

in the ordinary course of business the company is subject to litigation and may not always be successful in defending itself against such claims 

  

the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business which can result in settlements awards and injunctions it is inherently difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters particularly in cases in which claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages and a substantial judgment settlement fine or penalty could be material to the company’s operating results or cash flows for a particular future period depending on the company’s results for that period 

  

from time to time the company is subject to litigation claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights eg patents such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources if the company was found to have infringed a thirdparty patent or other intellectual property rights it could incur substantial liability and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology or providing certain products or services 

  

legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively impact the company’s business and financial results 

  

new legislation rule changes or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal state and sro rules and regulations may directly affect the operation and profitability of the company or its specific business lines the profitability of the company could also be affected by rules and regulations which impact the business and financial communities generally including changes to the laws governing taxation electronic commerce client privacy and security of client data

a significant decrease in the company’s liquidity could negatively affect the company’s business as well as reduce client confidence in the company 

  

maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to the business operations of the company including margin lending mortgage lending and transaction settlement among other liquidity needs a reduction in the company’s liquidity position could also reduce client confidence in the company which could result in the loss of client accounts in addition if the company’s brokerdealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines regulators could limit the company’s operations and its ability to repay debt pay cash dividends and repurchase shares of its stock in particular any such limitations could have an adverse effect on csc which depends primarily on cash generated by its subsidiaries in order to fulfill its debt service obligations and otherwise meet its liquidity needs the company attempts to manage liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient liquid financial resources to fund its balance sheet and meet its obligations the company meets its liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by operations as well as cash provided by external financing fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances as well as changes in market conditions may affect the company’s ability to meet its liquidity needs 

  

specific risk factors which may adversely affect the company’s liquidity position include 

  

   

   

   

technology and operational failures could subject the company to losses litigation and regulatory actions 

  

the company faces technology and operating risk which is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems of the company or its vendors that constrain the company’s ability to gather process and communicate information and process client transactions efficiently and securely without interruptions this risk also includes the risk of human error employee misconduct external fraud computer viruses terrorist attacks and natural disaster the company’s business and operations could be negatively impacted by any significant technology and operational failures moreover instances of fraud or other misconduct including improper use or disclosure of confidential client or employee information might also negatively impact the company’s reputation and client confidence in the company in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances despite the company’s efforts to identify areas of risk oversee operational areas involving risk and implement policies and procedures designed to manage risk there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer unexpected losses due to technology or other operational failures including those of its vendors 

  

the company also faces risk related to its security guarantee which covers client losses from unauthorized account activity such as those caused by external fraud involving the compromise of clients’ login and password information losses reimbursed under the guarantee could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations 

  

the company relies on outsourced service providers to perform key functions 

  

the company relies on service providers to perform certain key technology processing and support functions these service providers also face technology and operating risk and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of the company’s confidential client or employee information could cause the company to incur losses and could harm the company’s reputation the company also faces the risk that a service provider could without adequate notice cease to provide services which could disrupt the company’s operations switching to an alternative service provider may also require a transition period and result in less efficient operations

the charles schwab corporation 

  

the company may suffer significant losses from its credit exposures 

  

the company’s businesses are subject to the risk that a client or counterparty will fail to perform its contractual obligations or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate the company’s exposure mainly results from margin lending activities securities lending activities its role as a counterparty in financial contracts investing activities banking loan portfolios and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the company’s proprietary funds 

  

significant interest rate changes could affect the company’s profitability and financial condition 

  

the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interestearning assets such as margin loans and customer mortgages and its funding sources such as customer deposits and company borrowings changes in interest rates could affect the interest earned on interestearning assets differently than the interest the company pays on its interestbearing liabilities in general the company is positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment and could be adversely affected by a general decline in interest rates although any potential reduction in net interest income may be offset by growth in the company’s loan portfolio and inflows of client cash in addition in the event prevailing shortterm interest rates declined to the point where yields available on money market mutual funds approached the level of management fees on those funds the company could find itself in the position of having to reduce its management fees so that it could continue to pay clients a competitive return on their assets 

  

potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on the company’s financial position 

  

the company evaluates potential strategic transactions including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions any such transaction could have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows the process of evaluating negotiating and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert management’s attention from other business concerns and might cause the loss of key clients employees and business partners moreover integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties including the need to integrate operational financial and management information systems and management controls integrate relationships with clients and business partners and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas in addition an acquisition may cause the company to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation further the company may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition including the acquisition of the 401k company and any future acquisition could be dilutive to the company’s current stockholders’ percentage ownership or to earnings per share eps 

  

the company’s acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business operations or financial condition of the entity being acquired or sold to the extent the company enters into an agreement to buy or sell an entity including the existing agreement to sell us trust there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected or at all if a material transaction does not close the company’s stock price could decline 

  

the company’s stock price has fluctuated historically and may continue to fluctuate 

  

the company’s stock price can be volatile among the factors that may affect the company’s stock price are the following 

  

   

   

   

changes in the stock market generally or as it concerns the company’s industry as well as geopolitical economic and business factors unrelated to the company may also affect the company’s stock price

developments in the business economic and geopolitical environment could negatively impact the company’s business 

  

the company’s business can be significantly affected by the general environment – economic corporate securities market regulatory and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations trading activity interest rates and overall investor engagement these factors are outside of the control of the company and could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations and financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business including arbitrations class actions and other litigation some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages the company is also the subject of inquiries investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies in addition the company is responding to certain litigation claims brought against former subsidiaries pursuant to indemnities it has provided to purchasers of those entities

including penalties injunctions or other relief and the company may also determine to settle a matter because of the uncertainty and risks of litigation predicting the outcome of a matter is inherently difficult particularly where claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages or when investigations or legal proceedings are at an early stage in many cases including most class action lawsuits it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred or to estimate the range of that loss until the matter is close to resolution however based on current information and consultation with counsel management believes that the resolution of matters currently pending including those described below will not have a material adverse impact on the financial condition or cash flows of the company but could be material to the company’s operating results for a particular future period depending on results for that period

during 2006 interest rates stabilized and the sp 500 index and nasdaq composite index marked their fourth consecutive year of gains overall market returns for the year showed doubledigit gains for the three major indices – the dow jones industrial average increased 16 the standard and poor’s 500 index increased 14 and the nasdaq composite index increased 10 coupled with the strong market returns in 2006 the company experienced a general improvement in client asset flows and trading volume as the year progressed 

  

the company strengthened its operating and financial performance in 2006 by focusing on significantly improving the client experience in each of its two segments additionally reflecting a commitment to deliver a value proposition that includes high quality products and services at competitive prices the company reduced its commission pricing for a wide range of clients and eliminated certain fees in 2006 assets in client accounts were 1239 trillion at december 31 2006 up 18 from 2005 net new client assets in the schwab investor services and schwab institutional segments totaled 873 billion for the year up 33 from a year ago 

  

overall the company’s success in attracting client assets and building stronger client relationships as well as the interest rate environment and improved market performance led to a 24 increase in assetbased and other revenues and total net revenue growth of 19 expenses increased by 9 over 2005 levels primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense professional services expense and advertising and market development expense the company achieved an increase in its pretax profit margin from continuing operations due to revenue growth outpacing expense growth in 2006 return on stockholders’ equity grew in 2006 due to both a 69 increase in net income to 12 billion the highest level in the company’s history and its capital management activities including the repurchase of 859 million of common stock

in 2006 the company recorded an income tax benefit of 205 million related to the estimated difference between the tax and book bases of the company’s us trust stock this amount is included in income from discontinued operations net of tax on the company’s consolidated statements of income when calculating the company’s gain on the sale of us trust for income tax purposes the tax basis will be the basis of us trust’s prior stockholders in their shares as of the date us trust was acquired by the company since the transaction qualified as a taxfree exchange this tax benefit is management’s current estimate and is based on publicly available information including information on the composition of us trust’s stockholders at the acquisition date and the market price of us trust stock during relevant periods the final amount of the basis difference which could differ from management’s estimate will be determined following a survey of former us trust stockholders that the company expects to complete in mid2007 

  

the results of operations net of income taxes and cash flows of us trust have been presented as discontinued operations on the company’s consolidated statements of income and of cash flows respectively and the assets and liabilities of us trust have been combined and presented as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the company’s consolidated balance sheets the company’s consolidated prior period revenues expenses taxes on income assets liabilities and cash flows also reflect this presentation

results of operations 

  

 nm not meaningful 

  

the increase in assetbased and other revenues from 2005 was primarily due to an increase in asset management and administration fees resulting from higher levels of client assets and an increase in net interest revenue resulting from yields on assets increasing faster than those on liabilities the increase in trading revenues from 2005 was primarily due to higher client trading activity partially offset by lower average revenue earned per revenue trade resulting from reductions in the company’s commission pricing which were effective in the third quarter of 2006

the increase in expenses excluding interest from 2005 was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense professional services expense and advertising and market development expense the increases in the effective income tax rates from 2004 to 2006 were primarily due to higher state taxes 

  

the increase in income from continuing operations before taxes on income from 2005 was primarily due to higher assetbased and other revenues the higher income from continuing operations combined with the income from discontinued operations resulted in a 69 increase in net income 

  

certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current presentation all references to eps information in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflect diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted 

  

segment information 

  

the company evaluates the performance of its segments on a pretax basis excluding items such as restructuring charges impairment charges discontinued operations and extraordinary items 

  

as detailed in “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – 21 segment information” income from continuing operations before taxes on income was 15 billion for 2006 up 449 million or 44 from 2005 primarily due to increases of 278 million or 37 in the schwab investor services segment 87 million or 27 in the schwab institutional segment and an 84 million increase in unallocated and other income from continuing operations the increases in the schwab investor services and schwab institutional segments were primarily due to growth in net interest revenue and higher asset management and administrative fees combined with expense growth that was lower than revenue growth the increase in unallocated and other income from continuing operations was primarily due to the receipt of 25 million related to the confidential resolution of a legal matter in 2006 and restructuring charges recorded in 2005 

  

net revenues 

  

the company categorizes its revenues as either assetbased and other revenues or trading revenue as shown in the following table assetbased and other revenues trading revenue and total net revenues increased from 2005

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tabular amounts in millions except ratios and as noted 

  

schwab investor services and schwab institutional segments generate both assetbased and other revenues and trading revenues net revenues by segment are as shown in the following table 

  

   

the increase in net revenues in both the schwab investor services and schwab institutional segments was primarily due to higher levels of client assets and higher interest rate spreads the increase in unallocated and other income from continuing operations was primarily due to the receipt of 25 million related to the confidential resolution of a legal matter in 2006 

  

asset management and administration fees 

  

asset management and administration fees include mutual fund service fees as well as fees for other assetbased financial services provided to individual and institutional clients the company earns mutual fund service fees for transfer agent services shareholder services administration and investment management provided to its proprietary funds and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to thirdparty funds these fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in thirdparty funds and upon the average daily net assets of the company’s proprietary funds the company also earns asset management and administration fees for financial services provided to individual and institutional clients including trust and custody services 

  

the increase in asset management and related service fees from 2004 to 2006 was primarily due to higher levels of client assets in the company’s proprietary mutual funds and higher volumes of assetbased fees from certain client relationships including increases in average assets in schwab’s mutual fund onesource service 

  

net interest revenue 

  

net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on certain assets mainly margin loans to clients investments of segregated client cash balances loans to banking clients and securities available for sale and interest paid on supporting liabilities mainly deposits from banking clients and brokerage client cash balances net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies the company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall ie interestearning assets reprice more quickly than interestbearing liabilities in the event of falling interest rates the company might attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lockin asset yields as well as by lowering rates paid to clients on interestbearing liabilities 

  

in clearing its clients’ trades schwab holds cash balances payable to clients in most cases schwab pays its clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment and may invest these funds and earn interest revenue margin loans arise when schwab lends funds to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities pursuant to sec regulations client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients 

  

when investing segregated client cash balances schwab must adhere to sec regulations that restrict investments to us government securities participation certificates mortgagebacked securities guaranteed by the government national mortgage association certificates of deposit issued by us banks and thrifts and resale agreements

collateralized by qualified securities schwab’s policies for credit quality and maximum maturity requirements are more restrictive than these sec regulations schwab bank also maintains investment portfolios for liquidity as well as to invest funding from deposits raised in excess of loans to clients schwab bank invests in securities available for sale including commercial paper collateralized mortgage obligations corporate debt and us government securities schwab bank lends funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans these loans are largely funded by interestbearing deposits from banking clients 

  

the company’s interestearning assets are financed primarily by interestbearing brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients other funding sources include noninterestbearing brokerage client cash balances proceeds from stocklending activities and longterm debt as well as stockholders’ equity clientrelated daily average balances interest rates and average net interest spread are summarized as follows 

  

    

the increases in net interest revenue in the last two years were primarily due to changes in the composition of interestearning assets including increases in securities available for sale loans to banking clients and margin loan balances as well as generally higher yields on earning assets partially offset by higher interest rates on banking deposits

since the company establishes the rates paid on brokerage client cash balances and certain banking deposits and the rates charged on margin loans it manages a substantial portion of its net interest spread however the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition the company’s average net interest spread increased from 2004 to 2006 as the average yield on interestearning assets primarily clientrelated investments increased more than the average interest rate on funding sources

other revenue 

  

other revenue generally includes net gains and losses on certain investments service fees and software maintenance fees 

  

trading revenue 

  

trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues commission revenues are affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade principal transaction revenues are primarily comprised of revenues from client fixed income securities trading activity factors that influence principal transaction revenues include the volume of client trades market price volatility and changes in regulations and industry practices the increase in trading revenue from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades partially offset by lower average revenue earned per revenue trade as a result of reductions in commission pricing in 2006 and 2005 the decrease in trading revenue from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to lower average revenue earned per revenue trade as a result of reductions in commission pricing for a wide range of clients in 2005 and 2004 partially offset by higher daily average revenue trades 

  

as shown in the following table daily average revenue trades executed by the company increased 18 in 2006 average revenue earned per revenue trade decreased 14 from 2005 to 2006 and 41 from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the pricing changes discussed above

expenses excluding interest 

  

as shown in the table below total expenses excluding interest increased in 2006 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense professional services expense and advertising and market development expense 

  

   

compensation and benefits 

  

compensation and benefits expense includes salaries and wages incentive compensation and related employee benefits and taxes incentive compensation is tied to the achievement of specified objectives including revenue growth profit margin and eps therefore a significant portion of compensation and benefits expense will fluctuate with these measures 

  

the increase in compensation and benefits expense from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to higher levels of incentive compensation the decrease in compensation and benefits expense from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to a reduction in fulltime employees through the company’s past restructuring initiatives partially offset by higher levels of incentives to employees as a result of the company’s improved financial performance the following table shows a comparison of certain compensation and benefits components and employee data

expenses excluding compensation and benefits 

  

the increase in professional services expense from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to higher levels of fees paid to outsourced service providers and consultants the decrease in occupancy and equipment expense from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to the company’s past restructuring initiatives and other expense reduction measures the increase in advertising and market development expense from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to the company’s media spending related to its “talk to chuck™” national advertising campaign during 2006 the decrease in communications from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to decreases in telecommunication services news and quotes services and market data fees

liquidity 

  

csc 

  

csc’s liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries as well as cash provided by external financing schwab and schwab bank are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with csc management believes that funds generated by the operations of csc’s subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting csc’s liquidity needs providing adequate liquidity to meet schwab bank’s capital guidelines and maintaining schwab’s net capital 

  

csc has liquidity needs that arise from its senior mediumterm notes series a mediumterm notes as well as from the funding of cash dividends acquisitions and other investments the mediumterm notes of which 262 million was

csc also has direct access to 792 million of the 842 million uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines provided by eight banks that are primarily utilized by schwab to manage shortterm liquidity the amount available to csc under these lines is lower than the amount available to schwab because the credit line provided by one of these banks is only available to schwab these lines were not used by csc in 2006

technology and operating risk 

  

technology and operating risk is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems that constrain the company’s ability to gather process and communicate information and process client transactions efficiently and securely without interruptions the company’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and the company’s success depends in part on its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its technology in anticipation of evolving client needs to the extent the company experiences system interruptions errors or downtime which could result from a variety of causes including changes in client use patterns technological failure changes to its systems linkages with thirdparty systems and power failures the company’s business and operations could be significantly negatively impacted additionally rapid increases in client demand may strain the company’s ability to enhance its technology and expand its operating capacity to minimize business interruptions schwab has two data centers intended in part to further improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency the company is committed to an ongoing process of upgrading enhancing and testing its technology systems this effort is focused on meeting client needs meeting market and regulatory changes and deploying standardized technology platforms

derivative instruments and hedging activities as part of its asset and liability management process the company has entered into swaps that effectively convert the interest rate characteristics of a portion of the company’s mediumterm notes from fixed to variable the company has designated such swaps as fair value hedges as allowed by sfas no 133 – accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities since the notional amount fixed interest rate and maturity of these swaps exactly match the terms of the corresponding mediumterm notes the company has concluded that these swaps are completely effective in achieving the desired hedging results as permitted under sfas no 133 consequently changes in the fair value of these swaps totaling an aggregate of approximately 500000 and 2 million asset at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively are completely offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged mediumterm notes accordingly there has not been any impact on earnings as a result of this hedging program except for the conversion from a fixed to a floating rate of interest on a portion of the mediumterm notes

schwab bank’s loans held for sale portfolio consists of fixed and adjustablerate mortgages which are subject to a loss in value when market interest rates rise schwab bank uses forward sale commitments to manage this risk these forward sale commitments have been designated as cash flow hedging instruments of the loans held for sale accordingly the fair values of these forward sale commitments are recorded on the company’s consolidated balance sheet with gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income loss 

  

additionally schwab bank uses forward sale commitments to hedge interest rate lock commitments issued on mortgage loans that will be held for sale schwab bank considers the fair value of these commitments to be zero at the commitment date with subsequent changes in fair value determined solely based on changes in market interest rates any changes in fair value of the interest rate lock commitments are completely offset by changes in fair value of the related forward sale commitments 

  

at both december 31 2006 and 2005 the derivative assets and liabilities recorded by schwab bank for these forward sale and interest rate lock commitments were immaterial 

  

allowance for credit losses the company regularly evaluates its portfolio of loans to banking clients and provides allowances for the portion management believes may be uncollectible several factors are taken into consideration in this evaluation including current economic conditions the composition of the loan portfolio past loss experience and risks inherent in the loan portfolio for schwab bank’s portfolio which primarily consists of mortgage loans a riskbased methodology is used to determine the allowance for credit losses mortgage loans are categorized into portfolios by loan type and risk characteristics a probable loss rate based on company and industry experience is used to determine the credit allowance at december 31 2006 and 2005 the company’s allowance for credit losses was 4 million and 3 million on loan portfolios of 23 billion and 19 billion respectively 

  

legal reserve  reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter after considering among other factors the progress of the case prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases available defenses insurance coverage and indemnification and the opinions and views of legal counsel in many cases including most class action lawsuits it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred or to estimate the range of that loss until the matter is close to resolution in which case no accrual is made until that time reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved 

  

stockbased compensation the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r – sharebased payment under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected term of stock options the expected volatility of the company’s common stock and expected dividends significant changes in these assumptions for future awards could materially impact stockbased compensation expense and the company’s results of operations in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and the company’s results of operations could be impacted 

  

longterm incentive compensation eligible officers may receive cash longterm incentive plan units under a longterm incentive plan ltip these awards are restricted from transfer or sale and generally vest over a three to fouryear period each award provides for a onetime cash payment for an amount that varies based upon the company’s cumulative eps over the respective performance period of each grant the company accrues the estimated total cost for each grant on a straightline basis over each ltip’s vesting period with periodic cumulative adjustments to expense as estimates of the total grant cost are revised the estimated total cost of each grant will vary based upon changes in

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

market risk is the potential for loss due to a change in the value of a financial instrument held by the company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or currency exchange rates 

  

the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interestearning assets mainly margin loans to clients investments loans to banking clients mortgagebacked securities and other fixedrate investments and its funding sources including brokerage client cash balances banking deposits proceeds from stocklending activities and longterm debt which finance these assets to mitigate the risk of loss the company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk and by monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interestearning assets and funding sources the company also has the ability to adjust the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and certain banking deposits and the rates charged on margin loans the company’s exposure to equity price and currency exchange risks is not material 

  

financial instruments held for trading purposes 

  

the company holds fixed income securities which include municipal and government securities and corporate bonds in inventory to meet clients’ trading needs the fair value of such inventory was approximately 76 million and 74 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively these securities and the associated interest rate risk are not material to the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

financial instruments held for purposes other than trading 

  

debt issuances 

  

at december 31 2006 csc had 262 million aggregate principal amount of mediumterm notes outstanding with fixed interest rates ranging from 652 to 805 at december 31 2005 csc had 330 million aggregate principal amount of mediumterm notes outstanding with fixed interest rates ranging from 621 to 805 

  

the company has fixed cash flow requirements regarding these longterm debt obligations due to the fixed rate of interest the fair value of these obligations at december 31 2006 and 2005 based on estimates of market rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities was 277 million and 352 million respectively compared to their carrying amounts of 262 million and 332 million respectively 

  

interest rate swaps 

  

as part of its consolidated asset and liability management process the company utilizes swaps to effectively convert the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its medium term notes from fixed to variable for a discussion of such swaps see “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – 19 financial instruments subject to offbalance sheet risk credit risk or market risk” 

  

forward sale and interest rate lock commitments

net interest revenue simulation 

  

the company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulation model the model includes all interestsensitive assets and liabilities as well as swaps utilized by the company to hedge its interest rate risk key variables in the model include assumed balance growth or decline for client loans deposits brokerage client cash changes in the level and term structure of interest rates the repricing of financial instruments prepayment and reinvestment assumptions and product pricing assumptions the simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and as a result cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue actual results may differ from simulated results due to the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies including changes in asset and liability mix 

  

as demonstrated by the simulations presented below the company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall ie interestearning assets are repricing more quickly than interestbearing liabilities 

  

the forwardlooking simulations in the following table exclude all of us trust’s net interest revenue in 2006 and assume that the sale will close early in the third quarter of 2007 in addition the simulations assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as the company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood the company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the results of a gradual 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates relative to the company’s current base rate forecast on simulated net interest revenue over the next twelve months at december 31 2006 and 2005 

  

   

the simulations show an increase in exposure to rate changes at december 31 2006 from december 31 2005 and the company remains positioned to experience increases in net interest revenue as rates rise and decreases as rates fall if us trust’s net interest revenue is excluded from the 2005 simulations the simulations would have shown net interest revenue increasing 75 for an increase of 200 basis points and decreasing 75 for a decline of 200 basis points

the securities industry in the united states is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws schwab and cybertrader are registered as brokerdealers with the securities and exchange commission sec the fifty states and the district of columbia and puerto rico schwab and csim are registered as investment advisors with the sec additionally schwab is regulated by the commodities futures trading commission cftc with respect to the futures and commodities trading activities it conducts as an introducing broker 

  

much of the regulation of brokerdealers has been delegated to selfregulatory organizations sros namely the national securities exchanges the national association of securities dealers nasd and the municipal securities rulemaking board msrb schwab is a member of several national securities exchanges and is consequently subject to their rules and regulations the primary regulators of schwab and cybertrader are the nasd and for municipal securities the msrb the cftc has designated the national futures association nfa as schwab’s primary regulator for futures and commodities trading activities the company’s business is also subject to oversight by regulatory bodies in other countries in which the company operates 

  

the principal purpose of regulating brokerdealers and investment advisors is the protection of clients and the securities markets the regulations to which brokerdealers and investment advisors are subject cover all aspects of the securities business including among other things sales and trading practices publication of research margin lending uses and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities capital adequacy recordkeeping and reporting fee arrangements disclosure to clients fiduciary duties owed to advisory clients and the conduct of directors officers and employees

as registered brokerdealers certain subsidiaries of csc including schwab are subject to sec rule 15c31 the net capital rule and related sro requirements the cftc and nfa also impose net capital requirements the net capital rule specifies minimum capital requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of brokerdealers because csc itself is not a registered brokerdealer it is not subject to the net capital rule however if schwab failed to maintain specified levels of net capital such failure would constitute a default by csc under certain debt covenants 

  

the net capital rule limits brokerdealers’ ability to transfer capital to parent companies and other affiliates compliance with the net capital rule could limit schwab’s operations and its ability to repay subordinated debt to csc which in turn could limit csc’s ability to repay debt pay cash dividends and purchase shares of its outstanding stock

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

the company faces a variety of risks that may affect its operations or financial results and many of those risks are driven by factors that the company cannot control or predict the following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant although there may be other risks that could arise or may prove to be more significant than expected that may affect the company’s operations or financial results 

  

for a discussion of the company’s risk management including technology and operating risk and legal and regulatory risk see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – risk management” 

  

there has been aggressive price competition in the company’s industry which may continue in the future 

  

the company continually monitors its pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjusts commission rates interest rates and other fee structures to enhance its competitive position increased competition including pricing pressure could harm the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

the industry in which the company competes has recently undergone a period of consolidation and the company now faces stronger competitors 

  

the company faces intense competition for the clients that it serves and the products and services it offers there has recently been significant consolidation as financial institutions with which the company competes have been acquired by or merged 

  

 5  

the charles schwab corporation 

  

into or acquired other firms this consolidation may continue competition is based on many factors including the range of products and services offered pricing customer service brand recognition reputation and perceived financial strength consolidations may enable other firms to offer a broader range of products and services than the company does or offer such products at more competitive prices 

  

the company faces intense competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees especially for employees who are key to the company’s ability to build and enhance client relationships 

  

the market for quality professionals and other personnel in the company’s business is highly competitive competition is particularly strong for financial consultants who build and sustain the company’s client relationships the company’s ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon its ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs 

  

extensive regulation of the company’s businesses limits the company’s activities and may subject it to significant penalties 

  

as a participant in the securities and financial services industries the company is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws by governmental agencies supervisory authorities and sros such regulation continues to become more extensive and complex the requirements imposed by the company’s regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect clients these regulations often serve to limit the company’s activities by way of net capital customer protection and market conduct requirements and restrictions on the businesses in which the company may operate despite the company’s efforts to comply with applicable regulations there are a number of risks particularly in areas where applicable regulations may be unclear or where regulators revise their previous guidance any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by the company’s regulators could result in fines penalties cease and desist orders enforcement actions or suspension or expulsion of an affiliate its officers or employees any of which could harm the company’s reputation and adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

in the ordinary course of business the company is subject to litigation and may not always be successful in defending itself against such claims 

  

the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business which can result in settlements and awards it is inherently difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters particularly in cases in which claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages and a substantial judgment settlement fine or penalty could be material to the company’s operating results for a particular future period depending on the company’s results for that period 

  

changes in legislation rules and regulations could negatively impact the company’s business and financial results 

  

new legislation rule changes or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal state and sro rules and regulations may directly affect the operation and profitability of the company the profitability of the company could also be affected by rules and regulations which impact the business and financial communities generally including changes to the laws governing taxation electronic commerce and security of client data 

  

a significant decrease in the company’s liquidity could negatively affect the company’s business as well as reduce client confidence in the company 

  

maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to the business operations of the company including margin lending mortgage lending and transaction settlement among other liquidity needs a reduction in the company’s liquidity position could also reduce client confidence in the company which could result in the loss of client accounts in addition if the company’s brokerdealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines regulators could limit the company’s operations and its ability to repay debt pay cash dividends and repurchase shares of its stock in particular any such limitations could have an adverse effect on csc which depends primarily on cash generated by its subsidiaries in order to fulfill its debt service obligations and otherwise meet its liquidity needs the company attempts to manage liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient liquid financial resources to fund its balance sheet and meet its obligations the company’s liquidity needs are met primarily through cash generated by operations as well as cash provided by external financing risks in meeting these needs may arise with fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances as well as changes in market conditions 

  

 6  

the charles schwab corporation 

  

specific risk factors which may adversely affect the company’s liquidity position include 

  

   

   

   

technology and operational failures could subject the company to losses litigation and regulatory actions 

  

the company faces technology and operating risk which is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems of the company or its outsourced service providers that constrain the company’s ability to gather process and communicate information efficiently and securely without interruptions this risk also includes the risk of human error employee misconduct external fraud computer viruses terrorist attacks and natural disaster the company’s business and operations could be negatively impacted by any significant technology and operational failures moreover instances of fraud or other misconduct might also negatively impact the company’s reputation and client confidence in the company in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances despite the company’s efforts to identify areas of risk oversee operational areas involving risk and implement policies and procedures designed to mitigate risk there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer unexpected losses due to technology or other operational failures including those of outsourced service providers 

  

the company may suffer significant losses from its credit exposures 

  

the company’s businesses are subject to the risk that a client or counterparty will fail to perform its contractual obligations or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate the company’s exposure mainly results from margin lending activities securities lending activities its role as a counterparty in financial contracts investing activities banking loan portfolios and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the company’s proprietary funds 

  

significant interest rate changes could affect the company’s profitability and financial condition 

  

the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interestearning assets such as margin loans and customer mortgages and its funding sources such as customer deposits and company borrowings changes in interest rates could affect the interest earned on interestearning assets differently than the interest the company pays on its interestbearing liabilities in general the company is positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment and could be adversely affected by a general decline in interest rates although any potential reduction in net interest income may be offset by growth in the company’s loan portfolio and inflows of client cash in addition in the event prevailing shortterm interest rates declined to the point where yields available on money market mutual funds approached the level of management fees on those funds the company could find itself in the position of having to reduce its management fees so that it could continue to pay clients a competitive return on their assets 

  

potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on the company’s financial position 

  

from time to time the company evaluates potential strategic transactions including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions any such transaction could have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows the process of evaluating negotiating and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert management’s attention from other business concerns and might cause the loss of key clients employees and business partners moreover the integration of any acquisition may create unforeseen challenges for the company’s operational financial and management information systems as well as unforeseen expenditures and other risks including difficulties in managing facilities and employees in different geographic areas in addition an acquisition may cause the company to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation further the company may not realize a positive return on any acquisition and any future acquisition could be dilutive to the company’s current stockholders’ percentage ownership or to earnings per share eps

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

overview 

  

management of the company focuses on several key financial and nonfinancial metrics in evaluating the company’s financial position and operating performance results for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 are shown in the following table 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the company’s revenues are classified into assetbased and other ie asset management and administration fees net interest revenue and other revenue and trading categories the company generates assetbased and other revenues primarily through asset management and administration fees earned through its proprietary and thirdparty mutual fund offerings as well as feebased investment management and advisory services and interest revenue earned on margin loans loans to banking clients and investments assetbased and other revenues are impacted by securities valuations interest rates the company’s ability to attract new clients and client activity levels the company generates trading revenues through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenues from trading activity in fixed income securities trading revenues are impacted by trading volumes the volatility of equity prices in the securities markets and commission rates 

  

energy prices inflation concerns and shortterm interest rates increased throughout 2005 while overall market returns were mixed for much of the year with the dow jones industrial average ending 1 lower and the standard and poor’s 500 index and the nasdaq composite index ending up a modest 3 and 1 respectively the company experienced a general improvement in client asset flows and trading volume as the year progressed

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tabular amounts in millions except ratios and as noted 

  

following four years of restructuring and costcutting efforts management focused on returning to profitable growth in 2005 by enhancing the company’s personal service capabilities and developing stronger relationships with clients additionally reflecting a commitment to deliver a value proposition that includes high quality products and services at competitive prices the company significantly reduced its commission pricing for a wide range of clients over the course of the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first three quarters of 2005 schwab also invested for growth by eliminating account service fees for most accounts and order handling fees in the fourth quarter of 2005 as well as launching a significant new national advertising campaign assets in client accounts were 1199 trillion at december 31 2005 up 11 from 2004 net new client assets brought to the company totaled 750 billion for the year up 49 from a year ago 

  

overall the company’s price cuts contributed to a 24 decline in trading revenues for 2005 yet continued success in attracting client assets and building stronger client relationships as well as the rising interest rate environment led to a 16 increase in assetbased and other revenues and total revenue growth of 6 expenses decreased by 8 over 2004 levels primarily due to restructuring charges recorded in 2004 related to the company’s restructuring initiatives the company achieved a significant increase in its pretax profit margin from continuing operations due to the combination of higher revenues and lower expenses in 2005 return on stockholders’ equity grew in 2005 due to both a 153 increase in net income to 725 million the highest level in the company’s history and its capital management activities including the repurchase of 688 million of common stock 

  

subsequent events 

  

on january 26 2006 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 300 million of csc’s common stock in addition to the remaining authorization previously granted by the board of directors on july 28 2005 

  

on january 26 2006 on the recommendation of the nominating and corporate governance committee the board of directors elected marjorie magner to the board of directors to serve as a member of the class of directors whose term expires at the annual meeting of stockholders in 2006 

  

results of operations 

  

   

the increase in assetbased and other revenues from 2004 was primarily due to an increase in asset management and administration fees resulting from higher levels of client assets and an increase in net interest revenue resulting from yields on assets increasing faster than those on liabilities the decrease in trading revenues from 2004 was primarily due to lower average revenue earned per revenue trade resulting from reductions in the company’s commission pricing partially offset by higher client trading activity

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tabular amounts in millions except ratios and as noted 

  

the decrease in expenses excluding interest from 2004 was primarily due to lower restructuring charges occupancy and equipment expense and communications expense the increase in the effective income tax rate from 2004 was primarily due to higher state taxes in 2005 and a favorable tax settlement in 2004 

  

the increase in income from continuing operations before taxes on income from 2004 was primarily due to the combination of factors discussed above – higher assetbased and other revenue and lower restructuring charges the higher income from continuing operations as well as a lower loss from discontinued operations resulted in a 153 increase in net income 

  

effective october 1 2005 the company eliminated account service fees for most accounts and orderhandling fees based on the company’s thencurrent account base the impact of these eliminations is approximately 50 million of annualized revenues 

  

certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current presentation all references to eps information in this management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition reflect diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted 

  

segment information 

  

the company evaluates the performance of its segments on a pretax basis excluding items such as restructuring charges impairment charges discontinued operations and extraordinary items 

  

as detailed in “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – 24 segment information” income from continuing operations before taxes on income was 12 billion for 2005 up 540 million or 84 from 2004 primarily due to increases of 282 million or 59 in the schwab investor services segment 38 million or 14 in the schwab institutional segment 34 million or 49 in the us trust segment and a 186 million increase in unallocated income from continuing operations the increase in the schwab investor services segment was primarily due to lower expenses related to the company’s past restructuring initiatives as well as growth in assetbased and other revenue partially offset by lower trading revenue as a result of the company’s series of commission price reductions the increase in both the schwab institutional and us trust segments was primarily due to revenue growth outpacing expense growth the increase in unallocated income from continuing operations was primarily due to the restructuring charges recorded in 2004

while the schwab investor services and schwab institutional segments generate both assetbased and other revenues and trading revenues the us trust segment generates primarily assetbased and other revenues revenues by segment are as shown in the following table 

  

   

the increase in revenues in both the schwab investor services and schwab institutional segments was primarily due to higher levels of client assets and higher interest rate spreads resulting from the rising interest rate environment the increase in revenues in the us trust segment was primarily due to higher levels of client assets 

  

asset management and administration fees 

  

asset management and administration fees include mutual fund service fees as well as fees for other assetbased financial services provided to individual and institutional clients the company earns mutual fund service fees for transfer agent services shareholder services administration and investment management provided to its proprietary funds and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to thirdparty funds these fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in thirdparty funds and upon the average daily net assets of the company’s proprietary funds each of the company’s segments generates mutual fund service fees the company also earns asset management and administration fees for financial services provided to individual and institutional clients including investment management and consulting trust and fiduciary services custody services financial and estate planning and private banking services each of the company’s segments generates these fees which are primarily based on the value and composition of assets under management 

  

the increase in asset management and related service fees from 2003 to 2005 was primarily due to higher levels of client assets and higher assetbased fees from certain client relationships including increases in average assets in schwab’s mutual fund onesource service 

  

net interest revenue 

  

net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on certain assets mainly margin loans to clients investments of segregated client cash balances loans to banking clients and securities available for sale and interest paid on supporting liabilities mainly deposits from banking clients and brokerage client cash balances net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and hedging strategies the company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall ie interestearning assets are repricing more quickly than interestbearing liabilities in the event of falling interest rates the company might attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lockin asset yields as well as by lowering rates paid to clients on interestbearing liabilities each of the company’s segments generates net interest revenue 

  

in clearing its clients’ trades schwab holds cash balances payable to clients in most cases schwab pays its clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment and may invest these funds and earn interest revenue margin loans arise when schwab lends funds to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities pursuant to sec regulations client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients 

  

when investing segregated client cash balances schwab must adhere to sec regulations that restrict investments to us government securities participation certificates mortgagebacked securities guaranteed by the government national mortgage association certificates of deposit issued by us banks and thrifts and resale agreements collateralized by qualified

securities schwab’s policies for credit quality and maximum maturity requirements are more restrictive than these sec regulations in each of the last three years resale agreements accounted for over 50 of schwab’s investments of segregated client cash balances the average maturities of schwab’s total investments of segregated client cash balances were 155 days for 2005 148 days for 2004 and 161 days for 2003 us trust and schwab bank also maintain investment portfolios for liquidity as well as to invest funding from deposits raised in excess of loans to clients us trust and schwab bank lend funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans these loans are largely funded by interestbearing deposits from banking clients 

  

the company’s interestearning assets are financed primarily by interestbearing brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients other funding sources include noninterestbearing brokerage client cash balances proceeds from stocklending activities shortterm borrowings and longterm debt as well as stockholders’ equity clientrelated daily average balances interest rates and average net interest spread are summarized as follows 

  

   

the increases in net interest revenue in the last two years were primarily due to higher levels of and changes in the composition of interestearning assets including increases in margin loan balances loans to banking clients and securities available for sale as well as generally higher yields on earning assets partially offset by higher interest rates on brokerage client cash balances due to changes in the interest rate environment 

  

since the company establishes the rates paid on brokerage client cash balances and certain banking deposits and the rates charged on margin loans it manages a substantial portion of its net interest spread however the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition the company’s average net interest spread increased

from 2003 to 2005 as the average yield on interestearning assets primarily clientrelated investments increased more than the average interest rate on funding sources 

  

other revenue 

  

other revenue includes net gains and losses on certain investments service fees and software maintenance fees each of the company’s segments generates other revenue 

  

trading revenue 

  

trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues the schwab investor services and schwab institutional segments generate commission revenues by executing client trades these revenues are affected by the number of client accounts that trade and the average revenue earned per revenue trade principal transaction revenues are primarily comprised of revenues from client fixed income securities trading activity which are included in the schwab investor services and schwab institutional segments factors that influence principal transaction revenues include the volume of client trades market price volatility and changes in regulations and industry practices the decrease in trading revenue from 2003 to 2005 was primarily due to lower average revenue earned per revenue trade as a result of significant reductions in commission pricing for a wide range of clients in 2005 and 2004 partially offset by higher daily average revenue trades 

  

as shown in the following table daily average revenue trades executed by the company increased 27 in 2005 average revenue earned per revenue trade decreased 41 from 2004 to 2005 and 23 from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to the pricing changes discussed above

expenses excluding interest 

  

as shown in the table below total expenses excluding interest decreased in 2005 primarily due to lower restructuring charges occupancy and equipment expense and communications expense 

  

   

compensation and benefits 

  

compensation and benefits expense includes salaries and wages incentive and variable compensation and related employee benefits and taxes variable compensation is tied to the achievement of specified objectives primarily revenue growth and profit margin therefore a significant portion of compensation and benefits expense will fluctuate with these measures 

  

the increase in compensation and benefits expense from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to higher levels of incentive and variable compensation partially offset by a reduction in fulltime employees through the company’s 2004 cost reduction effort the increase in compensation and benefits expense from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to higher levels of discretionary bonuses to employees employee benefits and incentive compensation the following table shows a comparison of certain compensation and benefits components and employee data 

  

    

employee benefits and other expense decreased from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to a reduction in fulltime employees through the company’s past restructuring initiatives employee benefits and other expense increased from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to the reinstatement of the company’s 401k employee contribution match which was suspended in 2003 except for a discretionary award to certain nonofficer employees made in the fourth quarter of 2003

expenses excluding compensation and benefits 

  

the decreases in occupancy and equipment expense from 2003 to 2005 were primarily due to the company’s past restructuring initiatives and other expense reduction measures the increase in professional services expense from 2003 to 2004 were primarily due to higher levels of consulting fees in several areas including new and expanded products and services and information technology projects the increase in advertising and market development expense from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to the company’s increased print and other media spending 

  

restructuring 

  

during 2001 to 2004 the company carried out a series of restructuring initiatives which were designed to strengthen its productivity and efficiency and increase profitability these initiatives included workforce reductions reductions in operating facilities the removal of certain systems hardware software and equipment from service and the withdrawal from certain international operations the company completed its 2004 cost reduction effort in the first half of 2005 

  

as of december 31 2005 the company has recorded facilities restructuring reserves of 169 million net of estimated future sublease income of approximately 305 million this estimated future sublease income amount is determined based upon a number of factors including current and expected commercial real estate lease rates in the respective properties’ real estate markets and estimated vacancy periods prior to execution of tenant subleases at december 31 2005 and 2004 approximately 90 and 80 respectively of the total square footage targeted for sublease under these restructuring initiatives has been subleased the actual costs of the remaining restructuring reserves could differ from the estimated costs depending primarily on the company’s ability to sublease properties

on october 29 2004 the company completed the sale of its capital markets business to ubs and thereby eliminated the revenues and expenses unique to the capital markets business including commissions earned on trades from institutional clients principal transaction revenues on otc listed and nasdaq marketmaking operations and commission expense and floorbrokerage expense on institutional client trading activity in connection with the sale the company entered into eightyear order routing and execution services agreements with ubs for handling of schwab’s equity and listed options order flow ubs generally executes equity and options orders without commission or other charges certain ongoing fees apply for orders that require special handling or entail additional costs and such fees have been insignificant

liquidity and capital resources 

  

csc conducts substantially all of its business through its whollyowned subsidiaries the capital structure among csc and its subsidiaries is designed to provide each entity with capital and liquidity to meet its operational needs and regulatory requirements 

  

csc is a financial holding company which is a type of bank holding company subject to supervision and regulation by the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve board under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended csc and its depository institution subsidiaries which include us trust and schwab bank are subject to the federal reserve board’s riskbased and leverage capital guidelines these regulations require banks and bank holding companies to maintain minimum levels of capital in addition csc’s depository institution subsidiaries are subject to limitations on the amount of dividends they can pay to csc based on their respective regulatory capital ratios at december 31 2005 and 2004 the company and its depository institution subsidiaries are considered well capitalized 

  

liquidity 

  

csc 

  

csc’s liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries as well as cash provided by external financing csc’s depository institution subsidiaries and schwab are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with csc management believes that funds generated by the operations of csc’s subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting csc’s liquidity needs providing adequate liquidity to meet csc’s depository institution subsidiaries’ capital guidelines and maintaining schwab’s net capital 

  

csc has liquidity needs that arise from its senior mediumterm notes series a mediumterm notes as well as from the funding of cash dividends acquisitions and other investments the mediumterm notes of which 330 million was issued and outstanding at december 31 2005 have maturities ranging from 2006 to 2010 and fixed interest rates ranging from 621 to 805 with interest payable semiannually the mediumterm notes are rated a2 by moody’s investors service moody’s a by standard  poor’s ratings group sp and a by fitch ibca inc fitch 

  

csc has a prospectus supplement on file with the sec enabling csc to issue up to 750 million in senior or senior subordinated mediumterm notes series a at december 31 2005 all of these notes remained unissued 

  

csc has a registration statement under the securities act of 1933 on form s3 on file with the sec relating to a universal shelf registration for the issuance of up to 10 billion aggregate amount of various securities including common stock preferred stock debt securities and warrants at december 31 2005 all of these securities remained unissued 

  

csc has authorization from its board of directors to issue commercial paper up to the amount of csc’s committed unsecured credit facility see below not to exceed 15 billion at december 31 2005 no commercial paper had been issued csc’s ratings for these shortterm borrowings are p1 by moody’s a2 by sp and f1 by fitch 

  

csc maintains an 800 million committed unsecured credit facility with a group of eighteen banks which is scheduled to expire in june 2006 csc plans to establish a similar facility to replace this one when it expires these facilities were unused in 2005 any issuances under csc’s commercial paper program will reduce the amount available under this facility the funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes and csc pays a commitment fee on the unused balance of this facility the financial covenants in this facility require csc to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio as defined and csc’s depository institution subsidiaries to be well capitalized as defined management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on its ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements 

  

csc also has direct access to 794 million of the 844 million uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines provided by eight banks that are primarily utilized by schwab to manage shortterm liquidity the amount available to csc under these lines is 

  

 22  

the charles schwab corporation

tabular amounts in millions except ratios and as noted 

  

lower than the amount available to schwab because the credit line provided by one of these banks is only available to schwab these lines were not used by csc in 2005 

  

schwab 

  

most of schwab’s assets are readily convertible to cash consisting primarily of shortterm ie less than 150 days investmentgrade interestearning investments the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements receivables from brokerage clients and receivables from brokers dealers and clearing organizations client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities receivables from and payables to brokers dealers and clearing organizations primarily represent current open transactions which usually settle or can be closed out within a few business days 

  

liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts which were 242 billion 270 billion and 256 billion at december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for schwab in the future 

  

the company has a lease financing liability related to an office building and land under a 20year lease the remaining lease financing liability of 130 million at december 31 2005 is being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term 

  

to manage shortterm liquidity schwab maintains uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines with a group of eight banks totaling 844 million at december 31 2005 the need for shortterm borrowings arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements and the scheduled liquidation of interestbearing investments schwab used such borrowings for two days in 2005 with daily amounts borrowed averaging 39 million there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at december 31 2005 

  

to satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the options clearing corporation occ schwab has unsecured letter of credit agreements with eight banks in favor of the occ aggregating 630 million at december 31 2005 schwab pays a fee to maintain these arrangements in connection with its securities lending activities schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients schwab satisfies the collateral requirements by arranging letters of credit locs in favor of these brokerage clients that are guaranteed by multiple banks at december 31 2005 the outstanding value of these locs totaled 130 million no funds were drawn under these locs at december 31 2005 

  

schwab is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of brokerdealers these regulations prohibit schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings to csc paying cash dividends or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent or employees if such payment would result in net capital of less than 5 of aggregate debit balances or less than 120 of its minimum dollar requirement of 250000 at december 31 2005 schwab’s net capital was 11 billion 10 of aggregate debit balances which was 916 million in excess of its minimum required net capital and 576 million in excess of 5 of aggregate debit balances schwab has historically targeted net capital to be at least 10 of its aggregate debit balances which primarily consist of client margin loans 

  

to manage schwab’s regulatory capital requirement csc provides schwab with a 14 billion subordinated revolving credit facility which is scheduled to expire in september 2006 the amount outstanding under this facility at december 31 2005 was 220 million borrowings under this subordinated lending arrangement qualify as regulatory capital for schwab 

  

us trust 

  

the liquidity needs of us trust are generally met through deposits from banking clients equity capital and borrowings 

  

the excess cash held in certain schwab brokerage client accounts is swept into a money market deposit account at us trust at december 31 2005 these balances totaled 711 million

the company’s cash position reported as cash and cash equivalents on the company’s consolidated balance sheet and cash flows are affected by changes in brokerage client cash balances and the associated amounts required to be segregated under federal or other regulatory guidelines timing differences between cash and investments actually segregated on a given date and the amount required to be segregated for that date may arise in the ordinary course of business and are addressed by the company in accordance with applicable regulations other factors which affect the company’s cash position and cash flows include investment activity in securities levels of capital expenditures acquisition activity banking client deposit activity brokerage and banking client loan activity financing activity in shortterm borrowings and longterm debt payments of dividends and repurchases of csc’s common stock the combination of these factors can cause significant fluctuations in the levels of cash and cash equivalents during specific time periods for example cash and cash equivalents during the first nine

months of 2005 decreased by 889 million or 32 to 19 billion but during the full year 2005 cash and cash equivalents decreased by just 448 million or 16 to 23 billion 

  

in 2005 cash and cash equivalents decreased 448 million or 16 to 23 billion primarily due to increases in loans to banking clients and securities available for sale repurchases of common stock and movements of brokerage clientrelated funds to meet segregation requirements these changes were partially offset by increases in deposits from banking clients primarily related to sweep money market deposit accounts 

  

the excess cash held in certain schwab brokerage client accounts is swept into these money market deposit accounts at schwab bank or us trust at december 31 2005 these sweep deposit balances totaled 66 billion up 20 billion from december 31 2004 this sweep deposit activity is reflected on the company’s consolidated statement of cash flows as a cash outflow from payables to brokerage clients classified as an operating activity and a cash inflow to deposits from banking clients classified as a financing activity 

  

the company’s capital expenditures were 120 million or 100 million net of proceeds from the sale of fixed assets in 2005 and 198 million or 194 million net of proceeds from the sale of fixed assets in 2004 capital expenditures net as a percentage of revenues totaled 2 and 5 in 2005 and 2004 respectively in 2005 85 of capital expenditures were for information technology and 15 for facilities expansion and improvements capital expenditures include capitalized costs for developing internaluse software of 45 million in 2005 and 79 million in 2004 

  

management currently anticipates that 2006 capital expenditures will be approximately 25 higher than 2005 spending as has been the case in recent years the company may adjust its capital expenditures from period to period as business conditions change management believes that funds generated by its operations will continue to be the primary funding source of its capital expenditures

risk management 

  

overview 

  

the company’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks including technology and operations risk credit market and liquidity risks and legal and reputational risk identification and management of these risks are essential to the success and financial soundness of the company 

  

senior management takes an active role in the company’s risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying measuring and controlling various risks oversight of risk management has been delegated to the global risk committee which is comprised of senior managers of major business and control functions the global risk committee is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the company’s risk exposures and leading the continued development of the company’s risk management policies and practices

the global risk committee reports regularly to the audit committee of the board of directors audit committee which reviews major risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures 

  

the company’s disclosure committee is responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of the company’s a disclosure controls and procedures and b internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter the disclosure committee reports on this evaluation to the ceo and cfo prior to their certification required by sections 302 and 906 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 

  

additionally the company’s compliance finance internal audit legal and risk and credit management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating testing and monitoring the company’s risk management 

  

risk is inherent in the company’s business consequently despite the company’s efforts to identify areas of risk oversee operational areas involving risk and implement policies and procedures designed to mitigate risk there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer unexpected losses due to operating or other risks the following discussion highlights the company’s policies and procedures for identification assessment and mitigation of the principal areas of risk in its operations 

  

technology and operating risk 

  

technology and operating risk is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems that constrain the company’s ability to gather process and communicate information efficiently and securely without interruptions the company’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and the company’s success depends in part on its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its technology in anticipation of evolving client needs to the extent the company experiences system interruptions errors or downtime which could result from a variety of causes including changes in client use patterns technological failure changes to its systems linkages with thirdparty systems and power failures the company’s business and operations could be significantly negatively impacted additionally rapid increases in client demand may strain the company’s ability to enhance its technology and expand its operating capacity to minimize business interruptions schwab has two data centers intended in part to further improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency the company is committed to an ongoing process of upgrading enhancing and testing its technology systems this effort is focused on meeting client needs meeting market and regulatory changes and deploying standardized technology platforms 

  

technology and operating risk also includes the risk of human error employee misconduct external fraud computer viruses terrorist attack and natural disaster employee misconduct could include fraud and misappropriation of client or company assets improper use or disclosure of confidential client or company information and unauthorized activities such as transactions exceeding acceptable risks or authorized limits external fraud includes misappropriation of client or company assets by third parties including through unauthorized access to company systems and data and client accounts the frequency and sophistication of such fraud attempts continue to increase

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tabular amounts in millions except ratios and as noted 

  

the company has specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk and uses periodic risk selfassessments and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls the company maintains backup and recovery functions including facilities for backup and communications and conducts periodic testing of disaster recovery plans the company also maintains policies and procedures and technology to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to systems and data 

  

despite the company’s risk mitigation efforts it is not always possible to deter or prevent technological or operational failure or fraud or other misconduct and the precautions taken by the company may not be effective in all cases the company may be subject to litigation losses and regulatory actions in such cases and may be required to expend significant additional resources to remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures 

  

the company also faces technology and operating risk when it employs the services of various external vendors including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology processing and support functions the company manages its exposure to such outsourcing risks through contractual agreements and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance 

  

the company is actively engaged in the research and development of new technologies services and products the company endeavors to protect its research and development efforts and its brands through the use of copyrights patents trade secrets and contracts from time to time the company may be subject to litigation claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights eg patents such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources if the company were found to have infringed a thirdparty patent or other intellectual property rights it could incur substantial liability and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology or providing certain products or services

primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business guidance and control are provided through the creation approval and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various fiduciary risk committees 

  

legal and regulatory risk 

  

the company faces significant legal and compliance risk in its business and the volume of litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed have been increasing among other things these risks relate to the suitability of client investments disclosure obligations and performance expectations for company products and services supervision of employees and the adequacy of the company’s controls claims against the company may increase due to a variety of factors such as if clients suffer losses during a period of deteriorating equity market conditions as the company increases the level of advice it provides to clients and as the company enhances the services it provides to ias in addition the company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal state and foreign regulatory authorities and sros and such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex 

  

the company attempts to mitigate legal and compliance risk through policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid litigation claims and prevent or detect violations of applicable legal and regulatory requirements these procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics sales and trading practices marketing and communications extension of credit client funds and securities books and records antimoney laundering client privacy employment policies and contracts management despite the company’s efforts to maintain an effective compliance program and internal controls legal breaches and rule violations even if unintentional could result in reputational harm significant losses and disciplinary sanctions including limitations on the company’s business activities 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

the consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us while the majority of the company’s revenues expenses assets and liabilities are not based on estimates there are certain critical accounting policies that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position and reported financial results these critical accounting policies are described below management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the company’s financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy 

  

valuation of goodwill  under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 – goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually or whenever indications of impairment exist an impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value resulting in an impairment charge for this excess 

  

the company has elected april 1 as its annual goodwill impairment testing date in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on april 1 2005 management estimated the fair value of each of the company’s reporting units generally defined as the company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management and compared this value to the carrying value of the reporting unit the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was greater than its carrying value and therefore management concluded that no amount of goodwill was impaired the estimated fair value of the reporting units was established using a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit adverse changes in the company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition a loss of key personnel the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the company’s recorded goodwill the company’s goodwill balances net of accumulated amortization were 809 million and 811 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the decrease in goodwill in 2005 was primarily due to a purchase price adjustment related to us trust’s acquisition of state street corporation’s private asset management group in 2003 

  

valuation and estimated useful lives of intangible assets other than goodwill the company’s intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill principally the value of client relationships management generally obtains independent valuations to estimate the initial valuation and expected amortization

period for clientrelated intangible assets these valuations are primarily based on the present value of the estimated net cash flows expected to be derived from the client relationships and assumptions about future client attrition at each balance sheet date management compares the actual and estimated attrition for clientrelated intangible assets to evaluate whether revisions to the amortization period are necessary also management evaluates the clientrelated intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable therefore higher than expected client attrition may result in higher future amortization charges or an impairment charge for clientrelated intangible assets the company’s intangible asset balances net of accumulated amortization were 143 million and 153 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

restructuring reserves a portion of the reserves under the company’s restructuring initiatives are based on assumptions including the company’s ability to successfully sublease certain real estate properties the initial restructuring reserves and any subsequent changes in estimates of such reserves are recorded in restructuring charges on the company’s consolidated statement of income factors and uncertainties which may adversely affect the estimates of sublease income include deterioration in the respective properties’ real estate markets prolonged vacancy periods prior to execution of tenant subleases and subtenant default the company’s total facilities reserves related to its restructuring initiatives were 169 million and 248 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

pension and other postretirement benefits under us trust’s trusteed noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan the benefit obligation and related plan assets are based on certain estimates – years of employee service rate of increase in salary discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets – which are made by management with recommendations by actuaries in addition to the years of employee service rate of increase in salary and discount rate us trust’s postretirement medical and life insurance benefit obligation is based on the health care cost trend rate which is an actuarial estimated rate of future increases in per capita cost of health care benefits the company’s pension benefit obligation was 335 million and 312 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the related pension expense is included in compensation and benefits on the company’s consolidated statement of income and was 6 million 7 million and 8 million for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

derivative instruments and hedging activities as part of its asset and liability management process the company uses swaps to manage interest rate risk 

  

us trust uses liborbased swaps to hedge the interest rate risk associated with its variablerate deposits from banking clients and shortterm borrowings the company has designated these swaps as cash flow hedges as allowed by sfas no 133 – accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities therefore principally all of the cumulative change in the fair value of these swaps from inception totaling a net 14 million asset and 6 million liability at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss which is a component of stockholders’ equity that is not recognized in current earnings any actual hedge ineffectiveness which was immaterial for 2005 2004 and 2003 is recorded in interest expense on the company’s consolidated statement of income in order to maintain hedge accounting treatment management performs a quarterly assessment of its expectation that these swaps are effective in achieving the desired hedging results 

  

additionally the company has entered into swaps that effectively convert the interest rate characteristics of a portion of the company’s mediumterm notes from fixed to variable the company has designated such swaps as fair value hedges as allowed by sfas no 133 since the notional amount fixed interest rate and maturity of these swaps exactly match the terms of the corresponding mediumterm notes the company has concluded that these swaps are completely effective in achieving the desired hedging results as permitted under sfas no 133 consequently changes in the fair value of these swaps totaling an aggregate 2 million and 13 million asset at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively are completely offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged mediumterm notes accordingly there has not been any impact on earnings as a result of this hedging program except for the conversion from a fixed to a floating rate of interest on a portion of the mediumterm notes 

  

allowance for credit losses the company regularly evaluates its portfolio of loans to banking clients and provides allowances for the portion management believes may be uncollectible several factors are taken into consideration in this evaluation including current economic conditions the composition of the loan portfolio past loss experience and risks inherent in the loan portfolio for schwab bank and us trust portfolios which primarily consist of mortgage loans a risk

based methodology is used to determine the allowance for credit losses mortgage loans are categorized into portfolios by loan type and risk characteristics a probable loss rate based on company and industry experience is used to determine the credit allowance for each portfolio of loans at december 31 2005 and 2004 the company’s allowance for credit losses was 29 million and 27 million on loan portfolios of 85 billion and 68 billion respectively 

  

legal reserve  the company is subject to legal regulatory and other proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of its business the company establishes a reserve for potential losses that may arise out of these proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated the amount of the reserve which is determined on a casebycase basis represents the company’s best estimate of probable losses after considering among other factors the progress of each case experience in similar cases available defenses insurance coverage and the opinions and views of legal counsel however significant judgment is required in making this estimate and the actual cost of resolving a claim may be higher or lower than the amount of the recorded reserve 

  

stockbased compensation the company applies accounting principles board opinion apb no 25 – accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations for its stockbased employee compensation plans because the company grants stock option awards at an exercise price not less than market value there is no compensation expense recorded when the awards are granted effective january 1 2006 the company will account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r – sharebased payment under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected term of stock options the expected volatility of the company’s common stock and expected dividends significant changes in these assumptions for future awards could materially impact stockbased compensation expense and the company’s results of operations in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and the company’s results of operations could be impacted see “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – 2 significant accounting policies – new accounting standards” for a discussion of future compensation expense related to stock option awards including unvested stock options outstanding at december 31 2005 

  

longterm incentive compensation eligible officers may receive cash longterm incentive plan units under a longterm incentive plan ltip these awards are restricted from transfer or sale and generally vest over a three to fouryear period each award provides for a onetime cash payment for an amount that varies based upon the company’s cumulative eps over the respective performance period of each grant generally three to four years the company accrues the estimated total cost for each grant on a straightline basis over each ltip’s vesting period with periodic cumulative adjustments to expense as estimates of the total grant cost are revised the estimated total cost of each grant will vary based upon changes in estimated and actual cumulative eps amounts over each ltip’s performance period grants were issued under this ltip in 2003 2004 and 2005 with performance periods ending december 31 2006 2007 and 2008 respectively the ltip liability was 61 million and 24 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the ltip expense included in compensation and benefits expense on the company’s consolidated statement of income was 37 million 15 million and 9 million for the years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

market risk is the potential for loss due to a change in the value of a financial instrument held by the company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or currency exchange rates 

  

the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interestearning assets mainly margin loans to clients investments loans to banking clients mortgagebacked securities and other fixedrate investments and its funding sources including brokerage client cash balances banking deposits proceeds from stocklending activities and longterm debt which finance these assets to mitigate the risk of loss the company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk and by monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interestearning assets and funding sources the company also has the ability to adjust the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and certain banking deposits and the rates charged on margin loans additionally the company uses swaps to mitigate interest rate exposure associated with shortterm floating interestrate deposits the company’s exposure to equity price and currency exchange risks is not material 

  

financial instruments held for trading purposes 

  

the company holds fixed income securities which include municipal and government securities and corporate bonds in inventory to meet clients’ trading needs the fair value of such inventory was approximately 74 million and 54 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively these securities and the associated interest rate risk are not material to the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

financial instruments held for purposes other than trading 

  

debt issuances 

  

at december 31 2005 csc had 330 million aggregate principal amount of mediumterm notes outstanding with fixed interest rates ranging from 621 to 805 at december 31 2004 csc had 386 million aggregate principal amount of mediumterm notes outstanding with fixed interest rates ranging from 621 to 805 at both december 31 2005 and 2004 us trust had 52 million trust preferred capital securities outstanding with a fixed interest rate of 841 

  

the company has fixed cash flow requirements regarding these longterm debt obligations due to the fixed rate of interest the fair value of these obligations at december 31 2005 and 2004 based on estimates of market rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities was 407 million and 485 million respectively compared to their carrying amounts of 384 million and 451 million respectively 

  

interest rate swaps 

  

as part of its consolidated asset and liability management process the company utilizes swaps to manage interest rate risk for a discussion of such swaps see “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – 22 financial instruments subject to offbalance sheet risk credit risk or market risk”

net interest revenue simulation 

  

the company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulation model the model includes all interestsensitive assets and liabilities as well as swaps utilized by the company to hedge its interest rate risk key variables in the model include assumed balance growth or decline for client loans deposits brokerage client cash changes in the level and term structure of interest rates the repricing of financial instruments prepayment and reinvestment assumptions and product pricing assumptions the simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and as a result cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue actual results may differ from simulated results due to the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies including changes in asset and liability mix 

  

as demonstrated by the simulations presented below the company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and conversely a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall ie interestearning assets are repricing more quickly than interestbearing liabilities 

  

the simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as the company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood the company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the results of a gradual 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates relative to the company’s current base rate forecast on simulated net interest revenue over the next twelve months at december 31 2005 and 2004 

  

   

while the simulations show a reduction in exposure to rate changes at december 31 2005 from december 31 2004 the company remains positioned to experience increases in net interest revenue as rates rise and decreases as rates fall

     competition  in serving  investors  looking  for an  advisory  relationship
involves  a variety  of  traditional  brokerage  asset  management  and wealth
advisory firms  management believes that the companys competitive strengths in
this arena revolve  around its ability to provide  clients with an  individually

do business with the firm  another important aspect of the companys ability to
compete is its ongoing focus on efficiency and productivity as lower costs give
the company greater  pricing  flexibility  management  believes that this focus
remains  important in light of the recent  competitive  environment  in which a
number of competitors  reduced online trading commission rates and account fees
additionally   the  companys  nationwide  marketing  effort  is  an  important
competitive  tool because it reinforces the  attributes of the  schwabr  us

description of business

overview

     securities market returns were mixed for much of 2004 due to the cumulative
effects of ongoing  geopolitical  economic  and  energy  market  uncertainties
concerns about rising interest rates and a close presidential  election  while
this environment weighed on client engagement  the company actively pursued its
strategy of  refocusing on its core client base  improving  product and service
offerings for those clients  lowering  pricing  and  streamlining  its overall
infrastructure  in addition the company embarked on a firmwide cost reduction
effort  designed to mitigate the effects of its price  reductions and to improve
overall efficiency and productivity
     during the fourth  quarter of 2004  the  election  was  decided and market
returns turned positive in this improved  environment  client asset valuations
recovered and daily average  revenue trades rose by 39 over third quarter lows
the dow jones  industrial  average  the standard and poors 500 index  and the
nasdaq composite index ended 2004 up 3 9 and 9 respectively  total client
assets housed at the company rose by 12 during 2004 to 108 trillion  net new
client  assets  brought  to the  company  totaled  503 billion  for the  year
including 168 billion in the fourth quarter the highest in 13 quarters
     overall  the companys price cuts  contributed to a 14 decline in trading
revenues  for 2004  yet  continued  success  in  attracting  client  assets and
building  stronger  client  relationships  led to a 17 increase in  nontrading
revenues and total revenue growth of 8  expenses rose by 12 over 2003 levels
reflecting the  reinstatement  of the companys  401k match and the payment of
higher discretionary bonuses an increased marketing communications  investment
and the  recognition  of  261 million  in  aftertax  charges  relating  to the
companys exit from the capital markets business and its cost reduction  effort
as a result net income declined by 39 from 2003 and the companys 2004 profit
margin was 68  compared with 121 in the prior year the companys 2004 cost
reduction effort enabled the firm to steadily reduce its operating  expense base
throughout  2004  and  about  300 million  in  annualized  cost  savings  were
identified and implemented by year end
     the company  generates cash primarily through the revenues of its brokerage
and banking  subsidiaries  these revenues are classified  into  nontrading and
trading categories the company earns nontrading revenues primarily through
o    asset management and administration fees earned through its proprietary and
     thirdparty  mutual  fund  offerings   as  well  as  feebased  investment
     management and advisory services and
o    interest  revenue  earned on margin loans  loans to banking  clients  and
     investments
     nontrading revenues are impacted by securities valuations interest rates
the companys  ability to attract new clients  and client activity levels  the
company earns trading revenues through
o    commissions earned for executing trades for clients and
o    principal  transaction  revenues  for  trading  activity  in  fixed  income
     securities
     trading revenues are impacted by trading volumes  the volatility of equity
prices in the securities markets and commission rates
     management   of  the  company   focuses  on  several  key   financial   and
nonfinancial  metrics  as  shown in the  following  table in  evaluating  the
companys financial position and operating performance

     components  of client assets eg  money market funds  directly  impacts
     asset management and administration fee revenues
o    schwabs daily average  revenue trades dart is deemed by management to be
     a key indicator of client  engagement with securities  markets and the most
     prominent driver of commission revenues

     on stockholders  equity provide broad indicators of the companys  overall
     financial health operating efficiency  and ability to generate acceptable
     returns
o    revenue per average  fulltime  equivalent  employee  revenue  per fte is
     considered  by  management  to  be  the  companys   broadest   measure  of
     productivity  with the companys  restructuring  initiatives over the past
     four years revenue per fte has steadily improved to 269000 in 2004
o    revenue on client assets is defined as  annualized  basis points of revenue

2003 the companys  nontrading  revenues totaled 32 billion in 2004 up 471
million  or 17  from 2003  this increase was primarily due to an increase in
asset management and administration  fees resulting primarily from higher levels

from higher levels of and changes in the composition of interestearning assets
trading revenues  totaled 10 billion in 2004 down 165 million  or 14 from

partially offset by higher client trading activity
     total  expenses  excluding  interest  for 2004 were 36  billion  up 378
million  or 12 from 2003  this increase was primarily due to a 212 million
or 13  increase in  compensation  and benefits  expense  resulting from higher

charges
     income from continuing  operations before taxes on income and extraordinary
gain for 2004 was 645 million  down 72 million  or 10 from 2003  primarily

principles  nongaap  income  measure which excludes  items  described  below
management  believes that adjusted operating income is a useful indicator of the
ongoing  financial  performance of the companys  segments  and a tool that can
provide  meaningful  insight into financial  performance  without the effects of
certain material items that are not expected to be an ongoing part of operations
eg  extraordinary  items  nonoperating  revenues  restructuring  charges
impairment charges  acquisition and mergerrelated  charges  and discontinued
operations
     in 2004 net income of 286 million  included the following  items which in
total had the  effect of  decreasing  aftertax  income  by 252  million  133
million of aftertax  restructuring  charges a 128 million aftertax loss from
discontinued  operations  and a 9 million aftertax gain on an investment  in
2003 net income of 472 million included the following items which in total had

the sale of us trusts corporate trust business
     as detailed  in item 8  financial  statements  and  supplementary  data 
notes to  consolidated  financial  statements  26  segment  information  the
companys  adjusted  operating income before taxes was 845 million for 2004 up
64 million  or 8 from 2003 due to increases of  58 million  or 13 in the
individual investor segment  and 9 million or 23 in the us trust segment
partially  offset by a  decrease  of  21 million  or 7 in the  institutional
investor segment  the increase in the individual investor segment was primarily
due to higher  revenues  resulting  from increased  client trading  activity and
levels of client assets the decrease in the institutional  investor segment was
primarily due to growth in expenses  outpacing growth in revenues primarily as a
result of higher client acquisition and servicing costs

1  primarily consists of pretax gains on investments

     the increase in revenues in the us trust segment was primarily due to the
acquisition  of state street  corporations  private asset  management  group in
october  2003 and  higher  levels of  client  assets  see  item 8   financial
statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements

and  institutional  clients  the company  earns  mutual fund  service  fees for
transfer agent services  shareholder services  administration  and investment
management  provided to its proprietary funds and recordkeeping and shareholder
services  provided  to  thirdparty  funds  these fees are based upon the daily
balances of client  assets  invested in  thirdparty  funds and upon the average
daily net assets of the companys  proprietary  funds  mutual fund service fees
are earned through each of the companys segments  the company also earns asset
management and administration fees for financial services provided to individual
and institutional clients including investment management and consulting trust
and fiduciary  services  custody services  financial and estate planning  and
private  banking  services  these  fees are  primarily  based on the  value and
composition  of assets  under  management  and are  earned  through  each of the
companys segments
     the increase in asset management and related service fees from 2003 to 2004
was primarily due to higher levels of client assets and higher  assetbased fees
from certain client relationships the increase in mutual fund service fees from

earned on  schwabs  mutual  fund  onesourcer service the  increase  in asset
management  and  related  service  fees from 2002 to 2003 was  primarily  due to
higher assetbased fees from certain client relationships partially offset by a

through the  individual  investor and  institutional  investor  segments  these
revenues are affected by the number of client  accounts that trade  the average
number of revenuegenerating  trades per account and the average revenue earned
per revenue trade
     the decrease in commission  revenues from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to
lower  average  revenue  earned  per  revenue  trade as a result of  significant
reductions in commission pricing for a wide range of clients in 2004  partially
offset by higher  daily  average  revenue  trades  the  increase in  commission
revenues from 2002 to 2003 was  primarily  due to higher daily  average  trades
partially offset by lower revenue per revenue trade
     effective in june 2004  the company  lowered its online equity  pricing to
995 for clients with more than 1 million in assets at schwab and also lowered
commission pricing for a wide range of other clients additionally effective in
november 2004 the company lowered its base online equity commission  pricing to
1995  expanded  access  to  995  online  equity  commissions  and  lowered
commissions on online and brokerassisted trades of options contracts primarily
as a result of these pricing changes  the companys  average revenue earned per
revenue trade declined from 3097 in may 2004 to 1882 in december 2004

net interest revenue
     net interest  revenue is the difference  between interest earned on certain
assets  mainly margin loans to clients  investments of segregated  client cash
balances  loans to banking  clients  and  securities  available  for sale and
interest paid on supporting  liabilities  mainly  deposits from banking clients
and brokerage client cash balances net interest revenue is affected by changes
in  the  volume  and  mix  of  these  assets  and  liabilities  as  well  as by
fluctuations in interest rates and hedging strategies
     the companys net interest  revenue is earned through each of its segments
in clearing its clients trades  schwab holds cash balances payable to clients
in most  cases  schwab  pays its clients  interest  on cash  balances  awaiting
investment  and may invest these funds and earn interest revenue  margin loans
arise  when  schwab  lends  funds to  clients  on a  secured  basis to  purchase
securities  pursuant to sec regulations client cash balances that are not used
for margin lending are generally  segregated into  investment  accounts that are
maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients
     when investing  segregated client cash balances  schwab must adhere to sec
regulations   that  restrict   investments   to  us   government   securities
participation   certificates   mortgagebacked  securities  guaranteed  by  the
government national mortgage association certificates of deposit issued by us
banks and thrifts and resale agreements collateralized by qualified securities
schwabs policies for credit quality and maximum maturity  requirements are more
restrictive than these sec regulations  in each of the last three years resale
agreements  accounted for over 65 of schwabs  investments of segregated client
cash  balances   the  average  maturities  of  schwabs  total  investments  of
segregated  client cash balances were 142 days for 2004  161 days for 2003 and
66 days for 2002  us trust  and schwab  bank lend  funds to  banking  clients
primarily  in the form of mortgage  loans  these  loans are  largely  funded by
interestbearing deposits from banking clients

     the increase in net interest revenue from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to
higher  levels of and changes in the  composition  of  interestearning  assets
including  increases  in margin  loan  balances  loans to banking  clients  and
securities  available for sale  partially  offset by higher  interest  rates on
brokerage client cash balances due to changes in the interest rate  environment
the decrease in net  interest  revenue  from 2002 to 2003 was  primarily  due to
changes in the composition of interestearning  assets including the decline in
margin  loan  balances  and  the   corresponding   increase  in   clientrelated
investments  additionally the decline in yields on interestearning assets due
to changes in the interest rate environment from 2002 to 2003 was only partially
offset by lower yields on funding sources
     since the  company  establishes  the rates paid on  brokerage  client  cash

compensation and benefits
     compensation and benefits expense  includes  salaries and wages  incentive
and variable  compensation  related employee  benefits and taxes and retention
program costs arising from certain  acquisitions and mergers  employees receive
variable  compensation that is tied to the achievement of specified  objectives
primarily related to revenue growth and profit margin  therefore a significant
portion of compensation and benefits expense will fluctuate with these measures
     the increase in  compensation  and  benefits  expense from 2003 to 2004 was
primarily due to higher levels of discretionary  bonuses to employees  employee
benefits and incentive compensation  the decrease in compensation and benefits
expense  from  2002  to 2003  was  primarily  due to a  reduction  in  fulltime
equivalent  employees through the companys expense reduction measures and lower
levels of employee  benefits  partially  offset by higher  levels of  incentive
compensation and discretionary bonuses to employees the following table shows a

     employee  benefits and other expense  increased from 2003 to 2004 primarily
due to the  reinstatement of the companys 401k employee  contribution  match
which  was  suspended  in 2003  except  for a  discretionary  award to  certain
nonofficer employees made in the fourth quarter of 2003 employee benefits and
other expense decreased from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to the suspension of the
companys 401k employer contribution in 2003 as discussed above additionally
employee  benefits and other expense  includes net pension expense of 7 million
in 2004 and 8 million in 2003 related to  us trusts  defined benefit pension
plan  compared  to net pension  income of less than  1 million  for 2002  the
increase  in  pension  expense in 2003 was  primarily  due to changes in certain
assumptions used to calculate  pension  expense  including the expected rate of
return on pension plan assets and the discount rate both effective in 2003

expenses excluding compensation and benefits
     the  decreases in occupancy  and  equipment  expense from 2002 to 2004 were

reduction measures see description of business  restructuring
     the  increases  in  professional  services  expense  from 2002 to 2004 were

     the  companys   effective  income  tax  rate  on  income  from  continuing
operations  was 358 in 2004  336 in 2003 and 402 in 2002 the increase in
the  effective  income  tax  rate  from  2003 to 2004 was  primarily  due to tax
benefits in 2003 related to the  deductibility  of certain costs associated with
the  companys  merger  with  us  trust  and the  companys  sale of its  uk
marketmaking operation the decrease in the effective income tax rate from 2002
to 2003 was primarily due to the tax benefits in 2003 discussed  above  as well
as an  impairment  charge in 2002 related to the  companys  uk  marketmaking
operation  which was not  deductible  for tax purposes  management  expects the
companys effective income tax rate in 2005 to be approximately 38

utilized by schwab to manage shortterm  liquidity  the amount available to csc
under  these  lines is lower than the amount  available  to schwab  because  the

schwab
     most of  schwabs  assets  are  readily  convertible  to  cash  consisting
primarily  of   shortterm   ie   less  than  150  days   investmentgrade
interestearning  investments  the  majority  of which are  segregated  for the
exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory  requirements  receivables
from  brokerage  clients  and  receivables  from brokers  dealers and clearing
organizations  client  margin  loans are  demand  loan  obligations  secured by
readily marketable securities receivables from and payables to brokers dealers
and clearing organizations primarily represent current open transactions  which
usually settle or can be closed out within a few business days
     liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing  activities
are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts which were
270 billion  256 billion and 249 billion at december 31 2004 2003 and

december 31  2004 as noted  previously  781 million  of these lines are also
available for csc to use the need for shortterm  borrowings  arises primarily
from  timing  differences  between  cash  flow  requirements  and the  scheduled
liquidation of interestbearing investments  schwab used such borrowings for 15
days in 2004 with the daily amounts borrowed averaging 46 million  there were
no borrowings outstanding under these lines at december 31 2004

connection with its securities lending activities schwab is required to provide
collateral  to  certain  brokerage  clients  schwab  satisfies  the  collateral
requirements by arranging  letters of credit locs in favor of these brokerage
clients  that are  guaranteed by multiple  banks  at  december 31  2004  the
outstanding value of these locs totaled  52 million  no funds were drawn under

     schwab is subject to  regulatory  requirements  that are intended to ensure
the  general  financial   soundness  and  liquidity  of  brokerdealers   these
regulations prohibit schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings to csc paying
cash dividends or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent or employees
if such payment  would result in net capital of less than 5 of aggregate  debit
balances or less than 120 of its minimum dollar  requirement of 1 million  at
december 31 2004 schwabs net capital was 12 billion 12 of aggregate debit
balances  which was 10 billion in excess of its minimum required net capital
and  723 million  in excess  of 5 of  aggregate  debit  balances  schwab  has
historically  targeted  net  capital to be at least 10 of its  aggregate  debit
balances which primarily consist of client margin loans
     to manage schwabs regulatory capital requirement csc provides schwab with
a  14 billion  subordinated  revolving  credit  facility which is scheduled to
expire  in  september 2005  the  amount  outstanding  under  this  facility  at
december 31  2004 was 220 million  borrowings under this subordinated lending

liquidity risk factors
     the  company  manages  risk  by  maintaining  sufficient  liquid  financial
resources  to fund its balance  sheet and meet its  obligations  the  companys
liquidity needs are met primarily through cash generated by operations  as well
as cash provided by external  financing  risks in meeting these needs may arise
with  fluctuations  in client  cash or deposit  balances  as well as changes in
market conditions
     specific  risk factors which may affect the  companys  liquidity  position
include
o    a dramatic increase in the companys client lending  activities  including
     margin  mortgage  and personal  lending  which may reduce the  companys
     liquid resources and capital position
o    a reduction in cash held in banking or brokerage  client accounts which may
     affect the amount of the companys liquid assets and
o    a  significant  downgrade  in the  companys  credit  ratings  which  could
     increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets

cash and capital resources
     the companys cash position  reported as cash and cash  equivalents on the
companys  consolidated balance sheet and cash flows are affected by changes in
brokerage  client  cash  balances  and the  associated  amounts  required  to be
segregated  under federal or other  regulatory  guidelines  timing  differences
between cash and investments  actually segregated on a given date and the amount
required  to be  segregated  for that date may arise in the  ordinary  course of
business  and  are  addressed  by the  company  in  accordance  with  applicable
regulations  other factors  which affect the  companys  cash position and cash
flows  include  investment

risk management

overview

     the  companys  business  activities  expose  it  to  a  variety  of  risks
including but not limited to those discussed below identification assessment
and  management  of these  risks are  essential  to the  success  and  financial
soundness of the company
     senior  management  takes an active role in the companys  risk  management
process and has developed  policies and procedures under which specific business
and control units are responsible for  identifying  measuring  and controlling
various  risks  oversight of risk  management  has been delegated to the global
risk steering committee  which is comprised of managers who lead major business
and control  functions  the global risk steering  committee is responsible  for
reviewing and monitoring the companys risk exposures  leading in the continued
development  of the  companys  risk  management  policies  and  practices  and
reviewing changes in regulation and other riskrelated developments  the global
risk  steering  committee  regularly  reports  on risk  management  to the audit
committee of the board of directors  which reviews major risk exposures and the
steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures
     the company  also has a number of  functional  risk  subcommittees  which
report  into the global  risk  steering  committee  on a frequent  basis  these
subcommittees include
o    technology and operations risk committee which focuses on the integrity of
     operational controls and operating capacity of the companys technology and
     operations systems
o    financial risk oversight  committee  which focuses on the credit exposures
     resulting from client activity eg  margin lending  activities and loans

     additionally the companys compliance finance internal audit legal and
risk and credit  management  departments  assist management and the various risk
committees in evaluating testing and monitoring the companys risk management
     risk is  inherent  in the  companys  business  consequently  despite the
companys efforts to identify areas of risk oversee operational areas involving
risk and implement policies and procedures designed to mitigate risk there can
be no  assurance  that the  company  will not  suffer  unexpected  losses due to
operating or other risks
     the following discussion  highlights the companys principal risks and some
of  the  policies  and  procedures  for  risk  identification  assessment  and
mitigation  see liquidity  and capital  resources for a discussion on liquidity

credit risk and market risk

technology and operating risk
     technology and operating risk is the potential for loss due to deficiencies
in control processes or technology  systems that constrain the companys ability
to gather process and communicate information efficiently and securely without
interruptions the companys operations are highly dependent on the integrity of
its  technology  systems and the  companys  success  depends  in part  on its
ability  to  make  timely  enhancements  and  additions  to  its  technology  in
anticipation  of evolving  client needs  to the extent the company  experiences
system  interruptions  errors or downtime which could result from a variety of
causes including changes in client use patterns technological failure changes
to its systems  linkages with thirdparty  systems  and power  failures  the
companys  business and operations could be significantly  negatively  impacted
additionally  rapid increases in client demand may strain the companys ability
to enhance  its  technology  and  expand its  operating  capacity  to  minimize
business  interruptions  schwab  has two data  centers  intended  in part  to
further  improve  the  recovery  of  business  processing  in  the  event  of an
emergency  the  company  is  committed  to an  ongoing  process  of  upgrading
enhancing and testing its technology systems this effort is focused on meeting
client needs meeting market and regulatory changes and deploying  standardized
technology platforms
     technology  and  operating  risk  also  includes  the risk of human  error
employee  misconduct  external fraud  computer viruses  terrorist attack and
natural disaster  employee misconduct could include fraud and  misappropriation
of client or company assets  improper use or disclosure of confidential  client
or  company  information  and  unauthorized  activities  such as  transactions
exceeding  acceptable  risks  or  authorized  limits  external  fraud  includes
misappropriation of client or company assets by third parties including through
unauthorized  access  to  company  systems  and data and  client  accounts  the
frequency and sophistication of such fraud attempts continue to increase
     the company has  specific  policies and  procedures  to identify and manage
operational  risk  and uses periodic risk  selfassessments  and internal audit
reviews to evaluate the  effectiveness of these internal  controls  the company
maintains  backup and recovery  functions  including  facilities for backup and
communications  and conducts  periodic testing of disaster  recovery plans the
company also maintains policies and procedures and technology to protect against
fraud and unauthorized access to systems and data
     despite the companys risk mitigation efforts it is not always possible to
deter  or  prevent  technological  or  operational  failure  or  fraud or other
misconduct and the precautions taken by the company may not be effective in all
cases the company may be subject to litigation  losses and regulatory actions
in such cases and may be required to expend significant additional resources to
remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures
     the company also faces  technology  and operating  risk when it employs the
services of various  external  vendors  including  domestic  and  international
outsourcing of certain technology processing and support functions the company
manages its exposure to such outsourcing  risks through  contractual  agreements
and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance
     the company is actively  engaged in the  research  and  development  of new
technologies  services  and  products  the company  endeavors  to protect its
research and development efforts and its brands through the use of copyrights
patents  trade secrets  and  contracts  from time to time the company may be
subject to litigation  claims from third parties alleging  infringement of their
intellectual  property rights eg  patents  such litigation can require the
expenditure of significant company resources  if the company were found to have
infringed a thirdparty patent or other intellectual  property rights it could
incur substantial liability and in some circumstances could be enjoined from

credit risk
     credit  risk is the  potential  for loss due to a  client  or  counterparty
failing to perform its contractual obligations  or the value of collateral held
to secure obligations proving to be inadequate the companys direct exposure to
credit risk mainly results from margin lending  activities  securities  lending
activities  its role as a counterparty  in financial  contracts  and investing
activities  and  indirectly  from the  investing  activities  of certain of the
companys  proprietary  funds to mitigate the risks of such losses the company
has  established  policies  and  procedures  which  include   establishing  and
reviewing   credit   limits   monitoring   of  credit  limits  and  quality  of
counterparties  and adjusting margin  requirements for certain  securities  in
addition  most of the  companys  credit  extensions  such as margin  loans to
clients  securities lending agreements and resale agreements are supported by
collateral  arrangements  these  arrangements  are subject to  requirements  to
provide additional  collateral in the event that market  fluctuations  result in
declines in the value of collateral received
     additionally  the company has exposure to credit risk  associated with the
companys  banking loan  portfolios  held at  us trust  and schwab bank  this
client credit  exposure is actively  managed  through  individual  and portfolio
reviews  performed  by account  officers  and senior line  management  periodic
assessment  of the  validity of credit  ratings  credit  quality and the credit
management  process is conducted by a credit review department which is separate
from  the loan  origination  and  monitoring  department  management  regularly
reviews asset quality including  concentrations  delinquencies  nonperforming
loans  to  banking  clients  losses  and  recoveries  all are  factors  in the
determination of an appropriate  allowance for credit losses  which is reviewed

fiduciary risk
     fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational  loss through
the breaching of fiduciary duties to a client fiduciary activities include but
are not limited to individual and institutional trust  investment  management
custody  and cash and securities  processing  the company attempts to mitigate
this risk by establishing  procedures to ensure that  obligations to clients are
discharged  faithfully and in compliance  with  applicable  legal and regulatory
requirements  business units have the primary  responsibility  for adherence to
the procedures  applicable to their business  guidance and control are provided
through the creation  approval  and ongoing  review of applicable  policies by
business units and various fiduciary risk committees

market risk
     see  discussion of market risk at item 7a  quantitative  and  qualitative
disclosures about market risk

legal and regulatory risk
     the company faces  significant  legal and compliance  risk in its business
and the  volume of  litigation  and  regulatory  proceedings  against  financial
services  firms and the amount of damages  claimed have been  increasing  among
other  things  these risks  relate to the  suitability  of client  investments
disclosure  obligations and performance  expectations  for company  products and
services  supervision of employees and the adequacy of the companys controls
claims against the company may increase due to a variety of factors  such as if
clients suffer losses during a period of deteriorating equity market conditions
as the company increases the level of advice it provides to clients  and as the
company  enhances the services it provides to ias in addition  the company and
its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal state and foreign
regulatory authorities and selfregulatory  organizations  and such regulation
is becoming increasingly extensive and complex
     the company attempts to mitigate legal and compliance risk through policies
and procedures  reasonably  designed to avoid  litigation  claims and prevent or
detect  violations  of  applicable  legal  and  regulatory  requirements  these
procedures address issues such as business conduct and

potential strategic transactions
     the company from time to time engages in the evaluation  consideration and
negotiation  of a wide  array of  potential  strategic  transactions  including
business combinations acquisitions and dispositions any such transaction could
have  a  material  impact  on  the  companys  financial  position  results  of
operations eps or cash flows
     the process of integrating any acquisition may create unforeseen challenges
for the companys operational  financial and management information systems as
well  as  unforeseen  expenditures  and  other  risks  including  diversion  of
managements  attention from other business concerns  the potential loss of key
clients   employees  and  business  partners   and  difficulties  in  managing
facilities  and  employees  in  different  geographic  areas  in  addition  an
acquisition  may cause the company to assume  liabilities  or become  subject to
litigation  further  there can be no assurance that the company will realize a
positive  return on any  acquisition  or that  future  acquisitions  will not be
dilutive to the companys current stockholders percentage ownership or to eps


critical accounting policies

     the consolidated  financial statements of the company have been prepared in
accordance with accounting  principles  generally accepted in the us while the
majority of the companys  revenues  expenses  assets and  liabilities are not
based on estimates  there are certain critical accounting policies that require
management  to  make  estimates   regarding   matters  that  are  uncertain  and
susceptible to change where such change may result in a material  adverse impact
on the  companys  financial  position and  reported  financial  results  these
critical accounting policies are described below  management  regularly reviews
the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the companys financial
statements for reasonableness and adequacy

valuation of goodwill under the provisions of statement of financial accounting
standards  sfas no 142  goodwill and other  intangible  assets  goodwill is
required to be tested for impairment at least annually  or whenever indications
of impairment  exist an impairment  exists when the carrying amount of goodwill
exceeds  its implied  fair value  resulting  in an  impairment  charge for this
excess the companys goodwill balances net of accumulated  amortization  were
811 million and 810 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively
     the company has elected april 1 as its annual goodwill  impairment  testing
date  in testing for a  potential  impairment  of  goodwill  on april 1  2004
management  estimated  the fair value of each of the companys  reporting  units
generally defined as the companys  businesses for which financial  information
is available and reviewed  regularly by  management  and compared this value to
the carrying  value of the  reporting  unit  the  estimated  fair value of each
reporting  unit was greater than its carrying  value  and therefore  management
concluded  that no amount of goodwill was impaired  the estimated fair value of
the  reporting  units was  established  using a discounted  cash flow model that
includes  significant  assumptions  about the future operating  results and cash
flows of each reporting unit  adverse changes in the companys planned business
operations such as unanticipated  competition a loss of key personnel the sale
of a  reporting  unit or a  significant  portion of a reporting  unit  or other
unforeseen  developments could result in an impairment of the companys recorded
goodwill

valuation and estimated  useful lives of intangible  assets other than goodwill
the companys  intangible  assets represent  purchased assets that lack physical
substance  but can be  distinguished  from  goodwill  principally  the value of
client  relationships  management  generally obtains independent  valuations to
estimate   the  initial   valuation   and  expected   amortization   period  for
clientrelated  intangible  assets  these valuations are primarily based on the
present value of the  estimated  net cash flows  expected to be derived from the
client  relationships  and assumptions about future client  attrition  at each
balance sheet date  management  compares the actual and estimated attrition for
clientrelated   intangible   assets  to  evaluate  whether   revisions  to  the
amortization period are necessary also management evaluates the clientrelated
intangible  assets for impairment  whenever  events or changes in  circumstances
indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of the  asset  may  not  be  recoverable
therefore  higher than  expected  client  attrition may result in higher future
amortization  charges  or an  impairment  charge for  clientrelated  intangible
assets   the  companys   intangible   asset   balances   net  of  accumulated
amortization  were 153 million and 141 million at december 31 2004 and 2003
respectively

restructuring   reserves   a  portion  of  the  reserves  under  the  companys
restructuring  initiatives  are based on  assumptions  including  the companys
ability to successfully  sublease  certain real estate  properties  the initial
restructuring  reserves and any subsequent changes in estimates of such reserves
are recorded in restructuring charges on the companys consolidated statement of
income  factors and  uncertainties  which may adversely affect the estimates of
sublease income include deterioration in the respective  properties real estate
markets  including  northern  california  texas and new jersey and prolonged
vacancy  periods prior to execution of tenant  subleases  the  companys  total
facilities  reserves related to its restructuring  initiatives were 248 million
and 213 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively
     as of december 31  2004 the remaining facilities restructuring reserve is
net of estimated  future sublease  income of  approximately  310 million  this
estimated  future  sublease  income amount is determined  based upon a number of
factors  including  current and expected  commercial real estate lease rates in
the respective  properties real estate markets  and estimated  vacancy periods
prior to execution of tenant  subleases  at year end  approximately 80 of the
total square footage targeted for sublease under the  restructuring  initiatives
has been subleased up from approximately 65 at december 31 2003 the increase
in  subleased  square  footage is  primarily  due to the  subleasing  of certain
property in new jersey to a real estate  investment  trust in the second quarter
of 2004 partially offset by the addition of properties as part of the 2004 cost
reduction  effort  for a  further  discussion  on the  companys  restructuring

pension  and  other  postretirement   benefits   under  us trusts  trusteed
noncontributory  qualified defined benefit pension plan the benefit obligation
and  related  plan  assets are based on certain  estimates   years of  employee
service  rate of increase in salary  discount rate and expected rate of return
on plan assets  which are made by management with recommendations by actuaries
in addition to the years of employee  service  rate of increase in salary  and
discount rate  us trusts  postretirement  medical and life insurance benefit
obligation  is based on the health  care cost  trend rate which is an  actuarial
estimated  rate of future  increases in per capita cost of health care benefits
the companys benefit obligation at december 31  2004 and 2003 was 312 million
and 283 million respectively the related pension expense credit is included
in compensation and benefits on the companys  consolidated  statement of income
and was 7 million  8 million  and less than 1 million for 2004 2003 and
2002 respectively

derivative  instruments  and  hedging  activities  as  part  of its  asset  and
liability  management  process  the company uses swaps to manage  interest rate
risk
     us trust  uses  liborbased   swaps  to  hedge  the  interest  rate  risk
associated with  us trusts  variable rate deposits from banking clients  the
company  has  designated  these  swaps  as  cash  flow  hedges  as  allowed  by
sfas no 133   accounting for derivative  instruments  and hedging  activities
therefore  principally all of the cumulative  change in the fair value of these
swaps from  inception  totaling a net 6 million and  33 million  liability at
december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively has been recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive  loss  which is a component of  stockholders  equity that is not
recognized  in current  earnings  any actual hedge  ineffectiveness  which was
immaterial  for  2004  is  recorded  in  interest   expense  on  the  companys
consolidated  statement  of  income  in  order  to  maintain  hedge  accounting
treatment  management  performs a quarterly  assessment of its expectation that
these swaps are effective in achieving the desired hedging results
     additionally  the company has entered into swaps that effectively  convert
the  interest  rate  characteristics  of  a  portion  of  the  companys  senior
mediumterm  notes  series a  mediumterm  notes from fixed to variable  the
company  has  designated  such  swaps  as  fair  value  hedges  as  allowed  by
sfas no 133  since the notional  amount  fixed interest rate and maturity of
these swaps exactly match the terms of the corresponding  mediumterm notes the
company has concluded that these swaps are completely effective in achieving the
desired hedging results as permitted under sfas no 133  consequently changes
in the  fair  value  of these  swaps  totaling  an  aggregate  13 million  and
19 million asset at december 31  2004 and 2003  respectively  are completely
offset  by  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  hedged   mediumterm  notes
accordingly  there  has not been any  impact  on  earnings  as a result of this
hedging  program  except for the  conversion  from a fixed to a floating rate of
interest on a portion of the mediumterm notes

legal reserve the company is subject to legal regulatory and other proceedings
and claims arising from the conduct of its business  the company  establishes a
reserve  for  potential  losses that may arise out of these  proceedings  to the
extent that such losses are  probable  and can be  estimated  the amount of the
reserve  which is determined on a casebycase basis  represents the companys
best estimate of probable  losses after  considering  among other factors  the
progress  of  each  case  experience  in  similar  cases  available  defenses
insurance  coverage  and the  opinions  and  views of legal  counsel  however
significant  judgment is required in making this estimate and the actual cost of
resolving  a claim  may be  higher  or lower  than the  amount  of the  recorded
reserve

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     market  risk is the  potential  for loss due to a change  in the value of a
financial instrument held by the company as a result of fluctuations in interest
rates equity prices or currency exchange rates
     the company is exposed to interest rate risk  primarily from changes in the
interest rates on its  interestearning  assets mainly margin loans to clients
investments  loans to banking clients  mortgagebacked  securities  and other
fixedrate investments and its funding sources including brokerage client cash
balances   banking  deposits   proceeds  from  stocklending  activities  and
longterm  debt which finance these assets  to mitigate the risk of loss  the
company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines
on the  amount  of net  interest  revenue  at risk  and by  monitoring  the net
interest margin and average maturity of its interestearning  assets and funding
sources  the  company  also has the ability to adjust the rates paid on certain
brokerage  client cash  balances  and  certain  banking  deposits  and the rates
charged on margin  loans  additionally  the  company  uses  swaps to  mitigate
interest  rate  exposure  associated  with  shortterm  floating   interestrate
deposits  the companys exposure to equity price and currency exchange risks is
not material
     additional  qualitative and quantitative  disclosures about market risk are
summarized in the following  paragraphs  see item 8  financial statements and
supplementary data  notes to consolidated  financial statements  24 financial
instruments  subject to offbalance  sheet risk credit risk or market risk for
an additional discussion on market risk


                 financial instruments held for trading purposes

     the company  holds fixed income  securities  which  include  municipal and
government  securities  and  corporate  bonds  in inventory  to meet  clients
trading needs  the fair value of such inventory was  approximately  54 million
and 74 million at december 31  2004 and 2003 respectively  these securities
and the  associated  interest  rate  risk  are not  material  to the  companys
financial position results of operations or cash flows


           financial instruments held for purposes other than trading

debt issuances
     at december 31  2004 csc had 386 million  aggregate  principal amount of
mediumterm notes  outstanding  with fixed interest rates ranging from 621 to
805 at december 31  2003 csc had 466 million aggregate principal amount of
mediumterm notes  outstanding  with fixed interest rates ranging from 604 to
805 at december 31 2004 and 2003 us trust had 52 million trust preferred
capital securities outstanding with a fixed interest rate of 841
     the company has fixed cash flow requirements regarding these longterm debt
obligations  due to the  fixed  rate  of  interest  the  fair  value  of  these
obligations at  december 31  2004 and 2003  based on estimates of market rates
for debt with similar  terms and  remaining  maturities  was  485 million  and
584 million   respectively  which  approximated  their  carrying  amounts  of
451 million and 537 million respectively

interest rate swaps
     as part of its consolidated  asset and liability  management  process  the
company  utilizes  swaps to manage  interest rate risk for a discussion of such
swaps  see item 8  financial  statements  and  supplementary  data  notes to
consolidated  financial  statements    24  financial  instruments  subject  to
offbalance sheet risk credit risk or market risk

loans held for sale
     schwab  banks  loans  held for  sale  portfolio  consists  of  fixed  and
adjustablerate  mortgages  which are  subject to a loss in value  when  market
interest  rates rise  schwab bank uses forward sale  commitments to manage this
risk at december 31 2004 the forward sale commitments were designated as cash
flow  hedging  instruments  of the loans  held for sale  accordingly  the fair
values  of  the  forward  sale   commitments   are  recorded  on  the  companys
consolidated balance sheet with gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive
income loss at december 31  2004 and 2003 the derivative liability recorded
by schwab bank for these forward sale commitments was immaterial


                         net interest revenue simulation

     the company uses net interest  revenue  simulation  modeling  techniques to
evaluate and manage the effect of changing  interest rates the simulation model
the model includes all interestsensitive  assets and liabilities  as well as
swaps  utilized by the company to hedge its interest rate risk key variables in
the model include assumed balance growth or decline for client loans  deposits
and brokerage  client cash  changes in the level and term structure of interest
rates  the  repricing of financial  instruments  prepayment  and  reinvestment
assumptions   and  product  pricing   assumptions   the  simulations   involve
assumptions  that are inherently  uncertain and as a result  cannot  precisely
estimate  net

                         the charles schwab corporation


interest revenue or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on
net interest  revenue  actual results may differ from simulated  results due to
the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes
in market conditions and management  strategies  including changes in asset and
liability mix
     as  demonstrated  by  the  simulations  presented  below  the  company  is
positioned so that the  consolidated  balance sheet  produces an increase in net
interest  revenue when interest  rates rise and  conversely  a decrease in net
interest  revenue when interest  rates fall ie  interestearning  assets are
repricing more quickly than interestbearing liabilities
     the  simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability
structure of the consolidated  balance sheet would not be changed as a result of
the simulated  changes in interest  rates as the company  actively  manages its
consolidated  balance sheet and interest rate  exposure  in all  likelihood the
company  would take steps to manage any  additional  interest rate exposure that
could result from changes in the interest rate environment  the following table
shows the results of a gradual 100 basis point  increase or decrease in interest
rates  relative to the  companys  current base rate  forecast on simulated  net
interest revenue over the next twelve months at december 31  2004 and 2003 the
following  table also shows the results of a gradual 200 basis point increase or
decrease in interest  rates  relative to the companys  current  forecast of net
interest revenue over the twelve months ending december 31  2005 historically
the  company  had used a gradual 200 basis  point  change  when  evaluating  its
sensitivity  however  the company  changed to a 100 basis point  simulation in
december 2001 due to low levels of interest rates  given the recent increase in
interest  rates  the company will again report its  interest  rate  sensitivity
using a gradual 200 basis point change


december 31                                                    2004      2003

increase of 100 basis points                                    29      17
decrease of 100 basis points                                   28    64
increase of 200 basis points                                    57       na
decrease of 200 basis points                                   59      na

na  not applicable

     the down 100 basis  point  simulation  shows  reduced  exposure  to falling
interest rates at december 31 2004 compared to december 31 2003  this reduced
sensitivity  results from higher  interest  rates and an expectation of interest
rates  continuing  to  increase  both of which  lessen  the  impact  of  spread
compression between  interestearning  assets and brokerage client cash balances
and banking deposits

affect  the method of  operation  and  profitability  of the  companys  foreign
operations
     as registered brokerdealers certain subsidiaries of csc including schwab
and scm  are subject to the uniform net capital  rule rule  15c31  under the
securities  exchange  act of 1934 the net  capital  rule  which has also been
adopted  through  incorporation  by reference in nyse rule 325 the cftc and nfa
also impose net capital requirements the net capital rule specifies minimum net
capital requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness
and  liquidity of  brokerdealers  failure to maintain the required net capital
may subject a firm to suspension or expulsion by the nyse and the nasd  certain
punitive  actions by the sec and other  regulatory  bodies  and  ultimately may
require  a  firms   liquidation   because  csc  itself  is  not  a  registered
brokerdealer  it is not subject to the net capital rule however if schwab or
scm failed to maintain  specified  levels of net  capital  such  failure  would
constitute a default by csc under certain debt covenants
     net   capital  is   essentially   defined  as  net  worth  assets  minus
liabilities  plus qualifying subordinated borrowings  less certain deductions
that result from excluding assets that are not readily convertible into cash and
from  conservatively  valuing  certain other assets  these  deductions  include
charges  that  discount  the value of firm  security  positions  to reflect  the
possibility of adverse changes in market value prior to disposition
     the net capital rule requires  notice of equity  capital  withdrawals to be
provided to the sec prior to and  subsequent to  withdrawals  exceeding  certain
sizes such rule prohibits  withdrawals that would reduce a brokerdealers  net
capital to an amount less than 25 of its deductions required by the net capital
rule as to its  security  positions  the net capital  rule also allows the sec
under limited circumstances to restrict a brokerdealer from withdrawing equity
capital for up to twenty business days
     schwab and scm have elected the  alternative  method of  calculation  under
paragraph  a1ii of the net capital rule which requires a brokerdealer to
maintain  minimum net capital equal to the greater of 2 of its aggregate debit
items  computed in accordance  with the formula for  determination  of reserve
requirements  for brokers and dealers  under rule  15c33  or a minimum  dollar
amount  which is based on the type of business  conducted by the brokerdealer
the minimum  dollar  amount for both  schwab and scm is 1  million  aggregate
debit items are assets that have as their  source  transactions  with  clients
primarily margin loans  under the alternative method of the net capital rule a
brokerdealer  may not a pay  or permit  the  payment or  withdrawal  of any
subordinated borrowings or b pay cash dividends or permit equity capital to be
removed if after giving effect to such payment withdrawal or removal its net
capital would be less than 5 of its aggregate debit items
     under nyse rule 326  schwab is required to reduce its  business if its net
capital  is less  than  4 of  aggregate  debit  items  for  more  than  fifteen
consecutive  business  days  nyse  rule 326 also  prohibits  the  expansion  of
business if net capital is less than 5 of  aggregate  debit items for more than
fifteen  consecutive  business days the provisions of nyse rule 326 also become
operative if capital withdrawals including scheduled maturities of subordinated
borrowings  during the  following  six months  would result in a reduction of a
firms net capital to the levels indicated
     if compliance  with  applicable net capital rules were to limit schwabs or
scms  operations and their ability to repay  subordinated  debt to csc this in
turn could limit cscs  ability to repay debt  pay cash  dividends and purchase
shares of its outstanding stock see also managements  discussion and analysis

however  for purchases of certain types of  securities  such as certain mutual
fund  shares  a client must have a cash or money  market fund balance in his or
her account  sufficient  to pay for the trade prior to  execution  when selling
securities  a client is required to deliver the securities  and is entitled to
receive the proceeds  on settlement  date in an account  authorized for margin
trading  schwab  may lend a client a portion  of the  market  value of  certain
securities up to the limit  established by the federal reserve board  which for
most equity  securities is initially 50 these loans are  collateralized by the
securities in the clients account short sales of securities represent sales of
borrowed  securities  and create an  obligation  for the client to purchase  the
securities  at a later  date  clients  may  sell  securities  short in a margin
account  subject to minimum equity and applicable  margin  requirements  and the
availability of such securities to be borrowed and delivered interest on margin
loans to clients provides an important source of revenue to schwab during 2001

regulations  for margin  transactions  schwab  in the event of such an adverse
change  requires the client to deposit  additional  securities or cash so that
the amount of the clients obligation is not greater than specified  percentages
of the cash and market values of the  securities in the account  as a matter of
policy  schwab generally requires its clients to maintain higher percentages of
collateral values than the minimum percentages required under these regulations

other clients  pursuant to the requirements of rule 15c33 under the securities
exchange act of 1934 rule  15c33  the portion of such cash balances not used

                                   technology

     the  companys  ongoing  investment  in  technology  is a  key  element  in
expanding its product and service  offerings  enhancing  its delivery  systems
providing fast and consistent  client service  reducing  processing  costs and
facilitating  the companys  ability to handle  significant  increases in client
activity  without a  corresponding  rise in staffing  levels  the company  uses
technology  to empower its clients to manage  their  financial  affairs and is a
leader in driving technological advancements in the financial services industry
     the companys  operations  rely heavily on its  information  processing and
communications  systems  the  companys  system  for  processing  a  securities
transaction is highly automated registered representatives equipped with online
computer  terminals can access client  account  information  obtain  securities
prices and related information and enter orders online
     to  support  its  multichannel   delivery   systems   as  well  as  other
applications such as clearing functions account administration  recordkeeping

sophisticated computer network connecting all of the offices and regional client
telephone service centers  the companys computers are also linked to the major
registered  us   securities   markets   the  national   securities   clearing
corporation and the depository trust company
     failure of the companys information  processing or communications  systems
for a significant  period of time could limit the  companys  ability to process
its large volume of  transactions  accurately and rapidly  this could cause the
company to be unable to satisfy its obligations to clients and other  securities
firms and could result in regulatory  violations  external events  such as an
earthquake or power failure loss of external information feeds such as security
price  information  as well as internal  malfunctions  such as those that could
occur during the  implementation of system  modifications  could render part or
all of such systems inoperative
     to enhance the reliability of the system and integrity of data the company
maintains backup and recovery  functions  these include logging of all critical
files  intraday  duplication  and storage of all  critical  data outside of its
central computer site every twentyfour hours and maintenance of facilities for
backup and  communications  they also  include  the  maintenance  and  periodic
testing of a disaster  recovery plan that  management  believes would permit the
company to recommence essential computer operations if its central computer site
were to become inaccessible to minimize business interruptions the company has
data  centers  intended  in part  to further  improve the recovery of business
processing in the event of an emergency

                              business environment

     the companys business like that of other securities brokerage and related
financial services firms is directly affected by the fluctuations in securities
trading volumes and price levels that occur in fundamentally  cyclical financial
markets  as well as by changes in government  monetary policies that impact the
growth of bank loans and investments and the level of interest charged for loans
and paid on deposits  and other  funding  sources  the  company may  experience
significant variations in revenues from period to period depending on changes in
these factors and the overall business  environment  the companys  nontrading
revenues are less cyclical than its trading revenues but would be impacted by a
sustained downturn in the securities  markets  the company adjusts its expenses
in anticipation of and in response to changes in financial market conditions and
client trading patterns  certain of the companys expenses  including variable
compensation  portions of communications  and commissions clearance and floor
brokerage vary directly with changes in financial performance or client trading
activity  expenses relating to the level of contractors  temporary  employees
overtime hours  advertising and market development  and professional  services
are  adjustable  over the short term to help the company  achieve its  financial
objectives additionally development spending which includes media and project
spending  is discretionary and can be altered in response to market conditions
however  a significant  portion of the companys  expenses such as salaries and
wages  occupancy and equipment  and  depreciation and amortization do not vary
directly  at  least  in the  short  term  with  fluctuations  in  revenues  or
securities trading volumes  also the company views its development spending as
essential for future growth and therefore  prefers to avoid major adjustments in
such spending unless faced with a sustained  slowdown in revenue  growth  given
the prevailing market conditions and the companys  financial  performance  the
company reduced its development  spending in 2001 to approximately 406 million
down 23 from 2000  additionally in 2001 the company initiated a restructuring
plan  to  reduce  operating   expenses   for  a  discussion  of  the  companys

     the companys  business is also subject to  regulation by various  nonus
governments  securities exchanges and regulatory bodies particularly in those

affect  the method of  operation  and  profitability  of the  companys  foreign
operations
     as  registered   brokerdealers   certain  subsidiaries  of  the  company
including  schwab and scm  are subject to the  uniform  net capital  rule rule
15c31 under the securities  exchange act of 1934 the net capital rule which
has also been adopted through  incorporation  by reference in nyse rule 325 the
cftc and nfa also  impose net capital  requirements  schwab is a member firm of
the nyse  the nasd and the nfa  and scm is a member firm of the nasd  the net
capital rule  specifies  minimum net capital  requirements  that are intended to
ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of brokerdealers  failure
to  maintain  the  required  net capital  may  subject a firm to  suspension  or
expulsion  by the nyse and the nasd  certain  punitive  actions  by the sec and
other  regulatory  bodies  and  ultimately  may  require a firms  liquidation
because csc itself is not a registered  brokerdealer  it is not subject to the
net capital rule  however if schwab or scm failed to maintain specified levels
of net capital  such failure  would  constitute a default by csc under  certain
debt covenants
     net   capital  is   essentially   defined  as  net  worth  assets  minus
liabilities  plus qualifying subordinated borrowings  less certain deductions
that result from excluding assets that are not readily convertible into cash and
from  conservatively  valuing  certain other assets  these  deductions  include
charges  that  discount  the value of firm  security  positions  to reflect  the
possibility of adverse changes in market value prior to disposition
     the net capital rule requires  notice of equity  capital  withdrawals to be
provided to the sec prior to and  subsequent to  withdrawals  exceeding  certain
sizes such rule prohibits  withdrawals that would reduce a brokerdealers  net
capital to an amount less than 25 of its deductions required by the net capital
rule as to its  security  positions  the net capital  rule also allows the sec
under limited circumstances to restrict a brokerdealer from withdrawing equity
capital for up to twenty business days
     schwab and scm have elected the  alternative  method of  calculation  under
paragraph  a1ii of the net capital rule which requires a brokerdealer to
maintain  minimum net capital equal to the greater of 2 of its aggregate debit
items  computed in accordance  with the formula for  determination  of reserve
requirements for brokers and dealers rule 15c33 under the securities  exchange
act of 1934 or a minimum dollar amount which is based on the type of business
conducted by the  brokerdealer  the minimum  dollar amount for both schwab and
scm is 1 million  aggregate debit items are assets that have as their source
transactions with clients  primarily margin loans under the alternative method
of the net capital rule a brokerdealer  may not a pay or permit the payment
or  withdrawal  of any  subordinated  borrowings  or b pay cash  dividends or
permit  equity  capital to be removed if after giving  effect to such  payment

     renovate the building by issuing  longterm debt 235 million and raising
     equity capital 10 million  the subsidiarys  lease payments  which are
     guaranteed by csc to the trust vary with  fluctuations  in interest  rates
     and are  structured  to cover the  interest on the debt  obligations  and a
     specified  return on the equity  this financing  arrangement is known as a
     synthetic  lease  csc  has  provided  the  trust  with  a  residual  value
     guarantee which means that if the building is sold to a third party csc is

     client financing  clients securities transactions are conducted on either
a cash or margin basis  generally  a client  buying  securities in a cashonly
brokerage account is required to make payment by settlement date  usually three
business  days after the trade is executed  however  for  purchases of certain
types of securities  such as certain  mutual fund shares  a client must have a
cash or money  market fund balance in his or her account  sufficient  to pay for
the trade prior to execution  when selling securities  a client is required to
deliver the securities  and is entitled to receive the proceeds  on settlement
date in an account  authorized for margin  trading  schwab may lend a client a
portion of the market value of certain securities up to the limit imposed by the
federal reserve board  which for most equity securities is initially 50 these
loans are collateralized by the securities in the clients account  short sales
of securities  represent  sales of borrowed  securities and create an obligation
for the client to purchase  the  securities  at a later  date  clients may sell
securities  short in a margin  account  subject to minimum equity and applicable
margin  requirements  and the availability of such securities to be borrowed and
delivered
     interest on margin loans to clients provides an important source of revenue
to schwab  during 2000  schwabs  outstanding margin loans to clients averaged
198 billion  after  increasing from 1998 to 1999 and reaching a peak of 223
billion in april 2000  margin  loans to clients  declined  to 158  billion at
december 31 2000 along with the decline in equity  valuations in the securities
markets
     in permitting a client to engage in transactions  schwab faces credit risk
if the  client  fails to meet his or her  obligations  in the  event of  adverse
changes in the market value of the  securities  positions in his or her account
under applicable rules and regulations for margin  transactions  schwab in the
event of such an adverse  change  requires  the  client to  deposit  additional
securities or cash so that the amount of the clients obligation is not greater
than  specified  percentages  of the cash and market values of the securities in
the account  as a matter of policy  schwab  generally  requires its clients to
maintain higher  percentages of collateral  values than the minimum  percentages
required under these regulations
     schwab may use cash balances in client  accounts to extend margin credit to
other clients  pursuant to the requirements of rule 15c33 under the securities
exchange act of 1934 rule  15c33  the portion of such cash balances not used
to extend margin credit increased or decreased by certain other  clientrelated
balances must be held in segregated investment accounts  the balances in these
segregated investment accounts must be invested in cash or qualified securities
as defined by rule 15c33  to the extent client cash balances are available for
use by schwab at interest  costs lower than  schwabs  costs of  borrowing  from
alternative  sources  schwabs  cost of funds is reduced  and its net income is
enhanced   such  interest   savings   contribute   substantially   to  schwabs
profitability  and if a  significant  reduction of client cash balances were to
occur  schwabs  borrowings  from other  sources may have to increase  and such
profitability  would decline  to the extent schwabs clients elect to have cash
balances in their  brokerage  accounts swept into certain  schwabfundsr  money
market  funds  the cash  balances  available to schwab for  investments  or for
financing  margin loans are reduced  however  schwab receives asset management
and  administration  fees from such funds  based  upon  average  daily  invested
balances

other securities schwab and scm maintain inventories in such securities on both
a long and short basis  while long inventory  positions  represent schwabs and
scms ownership of securities  short inventory positions represent  obligations
of schwab and scm to deliver specified  securities at a contracted price  which
may differ  from  market  prices  prevailing  at the time of  completion  of the
transaction  accordingly both long and short inventory positions may result in
gains or losses as market values of such securities fluctuate

                               information systems

     schwabs  operations  rely  heavily  on  its  information   processing  and
communications systems  schwabs system for processing a securities transaction
is highly automated  registered  representatives  equipped with online computer
terminals can access client account  information  obtain  securities prices and
related information and enter orders online
     to  support  its  multichannel   delivery   systems   as  well  as  other
applications such as clearing functions  account administration  recordkeeping
and  direct  client  access  to  investment  information   schwab  maintains  a
sophisticated computer network connecting all of the offices and regional client
telephone service centers  schwabs computers are also linked to scm the major
registered  us   securities   exchanges   the  national  securities  clearing
corporation the depository trust company and the redibook ecn via scm
     failure of schwabs information  processing or communications systems for a
significant  period of time could  limit  schwabs  ability to process its large
volume of  transactions  accurately  and rapidly  this could cause schwab to be
unable to satisfy its  obligations to clients and other  securities  firms  and
could result in regulatory violations
     external events  such as an earthquake or power failure  loss of external
information  feeds  such as  security  price  information  as well as  internal
malfunctions such as those that could occur during the  implementation of system
modifications could render part or all of such systems inoperative
     to enhance the  reliability  of the system and  integrity  of data  schwab
maintains backup and recovery  functions  these include logging of all critical
files  intraday  duplication  and storage of all  critical  data outside of its
central computer site every twentyfour hours and maintenance of facilities for
backup and  communications  they also  include  the  maintenance  and  periodic
testing of a disaster recovery plan that management believes would permit schwab
to recommence essential computer operations if its central computer site were to
become inaccessible  to minimize business  interruptions  the company has data
centers  intended  in  part  to  further  improve  the  recovery  of  business
processing in the event of an emergency
     in  addition  ustc has an  outsourcing  agreement  with a third party that
provides data processing  security processing  custodial and other operational
support services  under the terms of the outsourcing agreement the thirdparty
provider has the right to terminate the contract upon the change in control that
resulted  from the merger of csc with ustc  the company  plans to repatriate to
the companys systems  substantially  all of the service  functions  provided by
this third  party  and the company and us  trust expect to be able to provide
for an orderly repatriation of such functions  the transition is expected to be
completed before the end of the third quarter of 2001 while management believes
that there will be a  successful  transition  there is a  possibility  that the
transition  could result in a significant  disruption to us trusts ability to
service its clients and as a  consequence  could  result in lost  business and a
deterioration in us trusts fee revenues

                                   regulation

     the  securities  industry  in the united  states is  subject  to  extensive
regulation  under both  federal  and state laws  the  securities  and  exchange
commission  sec is the  federal  agency  charged  with  administration  of the
federal  securities  laws  schwab  scm and  cybercorp  inc a subsidiary  of
cybercorp  are registered as  brokerdealers  with the sec schwab and csim are
registered  as  investment  advisors  with  the  sec  additionally  schwab  is
regulated by the commodities  futures trading  commission cftc with respect to
its introduced futures and commodities trading activities
     much  of  the   regulation  of   brokerdealers   has  been   delegated  to
selfregulatory   organizations   principally   the  national   association  of
securities dealers  inc nasd and the national  securities  exchanges such as
the new york stock  exchange  nyse  which has been  designated  by the sec as
schwabs primary regulator with respect to its securities  activities  the nasd
has been  designated by the sec as scms primary  regulator  with respect to its
securities  activities  the  chicago  board  options  exchange  cboe has been
designated as schwabs  primary  regulator  with respect to its options  trading
activities for 2000 and 2001 the national  futures  association  nfa has been
designated by the cftc as schwabs primary regulator with respect to its futures
and commodities trading activities  these  selfregulatory  organizations adopt
rules  subject to  approval  by the sec or cftc  governing  the  industry  and
conduct  periodic  examinations  of  brokerdealers  securities  firms are also
subject to regulation  by state  securities  authorities  in the states in which
they do business  in addition to its  membership in the nyse  schwab is also a
member of most other major us securities exchanges and is consequently subject
to their rules and regulations schwab and scm were registered as brokerdealers
in fifty  states  the  district of columbia  and puerto rico as of december 31
2000
     the principal purpose of regulations and discipline of  brokerdealers  and
investment  advisors is the  protection of clients and the  securities  markets
rather than  protection  of creditors and  stockholders  of  brokerdealers  and
investment  advisors  the  regulations to which  brokerdealers  and investment
advisors are subject  cover all aspects of the  securities  business  including
sales methods  trading practices among brokerdealers  uses and safekeeping of
clients  funds  and  securities   capital   structure  of  securities   firms
recordkeeping and reporting  fee arrangements  disclosure to clients  and the
conduct of directors officers and employees as registered investment advisors
schwab and csim are subject to the  requirements of the investment  advisers act
of 1940 and the  regulations  thereunder  which  impose  among  other  things
various  recordkeeping   reporting  and  disclosure  requirements  and  impose
limitations  on fees and  principal  transactions  between  an  advisor  and its
clients  the  state  securities  law  requirements   applicable  to  registered
investment  advisors are in certain cases more  comprehensive than those imposed
under the federal securities laws
     additional  legislation  changes in rules  promulgated  by the sec  other
federal and state regulatory authorities and selfregulatory  organizations  or
changes in the  interpretation  or  enforcement  of existing  laws and rules may
directly affect the method of operation and profitability of brokerdealers  and
investment advisors the profitability of brokerdealers and investment advisors
could also be affected by rules and  regulations  which  impact the business and
financial  communities  in  general  including  changes  to the laws  governing
taxation   antitrust  regulation  and  electronic  commerce   the  sec  cftc
selfregulatory organizations and state securities authorities may conduct civil
or  administrative  proceedings  which can result in  censure  fine  cease and
desist orders  or suspension or expulsion of a  brokerdealer  or an investment
advisor  its officers  or  employees  schwab and scm have been the subject of
such administrative proceedings
     the sec  ordered  the  exchanges  and  nasdaq  to submit a plan to phase in
decimal  pricing  which pricing began for certain  listed stocks and options on
september 5 2000  and which pricing  begins for certain  nasdaq  securities on
march 12 2001 and for all remaining equity  securities and options by april 9
2001 this change which will only affect the capital markets segment is likely
to cause decreases in average revenue per share traded and therefore management
considers it likely that  decimalization  will  adversely  impact this segments
revenues  applicable laws and regulations also limit scms ability to engage in
principal  transactions  with  certain  accounts  where  us  trust  acts  as a
fiduciary  see  also  managements  discussion  and  analysis  of  results  of

     net capital requirements as registered brokerdealers  certain subsidiar
ies of the  company  including  schwab and scm  are subject to the uniform net
capital rule rule  15c31 under the  securities  exchange act of 1934 the net
capital rule which has also been adopted through incorporation by reference in
nyse rule 325 the cftc and nfa also impose net capital requirements  schwab is
a member firm of the nyse the nasd and the nfa and scm is a member firm of the
nasd the net capital rule specifies  minimum net capital  requirements that are
intended  to  ensure  the  general   financial   soundness   and   liquidity  of
brokerdealers  failure to maintain the required net capital may subject a firm
to suspension or expulsion by the nyse and the nasd certain punitive actions by
the sec and  other  regulatory  bodies  and  ultimately  may  require  a firms
liquidation  because csc itself is not a  registered  brokerdealer  it is not
subject to the net capital  rule  however  if schwab or scm failed to maintain
specified levels of net capital  such failure would constitute a default by csc
under certain debt covenants
     net   capital  is   essentially   defined  as  net  worth  assets  minus
liabilities  plus qualifying subordinated borrowings  less certain deductions
that result from excluding assets that are not readily convertible into cash and
from  conservatively  valuing  certain other assets  these  deductions  include
charges  that  discount  the value of firm  security  positions  to reflect  the
possibility of adverse changes in market value prior to disposition
     the net capital rule requires  notice of equity  capital  withdrawals to be
provided to the sec prior to and  subsequent to  withdrawals  exceeding  certain
sizes such rule prohibits  withdrawals that would reduce a brokerdealers  net
capital to an amount less than 25 of its deductions required by the net capital
rule as to its  security  positions  the net capital  rule also allows the sec
under limited circumstances to restrict a brokerdealer from withdrawing equity
capital for up to twenty business days
     schwab and scm have elected the  alternative  method of  calculation  under
paragraph  a1ii of the net capital rule which requires a brokerdealer to
maintain  minimum  net  capital  equal  to 2 of its  aggregate  debit  items
computed  in  accordance   with  the  formula  for   determination   of  reserve
requirements for brokers and dealers rule 15c33 under the securities  exchange
act of 1934  aggregate  debit  items  are assets  that have as their  source
transactions with clients  primarily margin loans under the alternative method
of the net capital rule a brokerdealer  may not a pay or permit the payment
or  withdrawal  of any  subordinated  borrowings  or b pay cash  dividends or
permit  equity  capital to be removed if after giving  effect to such  payment
withdrawal  or removal  its net capital would be less than 5 of its aggregate
debit items
     under nyse rule 326  schwab is required to reduce its  business if its net
capital  is less  than  4 of  aggregate  debit  items  for  more  than  fifteen
consecutive  business  days  nyse  rule 326 also  prohibits  the  expansion  of
business if net capital is less than 5 of  aggregate  debit items for more than
fifteen  consecutive  business days the provisions of nyse rule 326 also become
operative if capital withdrawals including scheduled maturities of subordinated
borrowings  during the  following  six months  would result in a reduction of a
firms net capital to the levels indicated
     if compliance  with  applicable net capital rules were to limit schwabs or
scms  operations and their ability to repay  subordinated  debt to csc this in
turn could limit cscs  ability to repay debt  pay cash  dividends and purchase
shares of its outstanding stock see also managements  discussion and analysis
