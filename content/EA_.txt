live services net revenue particularly extra content net revenue has been material to our business and we expect it to continue to be so through our live services offerings we offer our players highquality experiences designed to provide value to players and extend and enhance gameplay these live services include extra content subscription offerings and other revenue generated outside of the sale of our base games our digital live services and other net revenue represented 71 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2022 our most popular live services are the extra content purchased for the ultimate team mode associated with our sports franchises and extra content purchased for our apex legends franchise ultimate team allows players 

to collect current and former professional players in order to build and compete as a personalized team live services net revenue generated from extra content purchased within ultimate team  a substantial portion of which was derived from fifa ultimate team  and for our apex legends franchise is material to our business 

the strength of our mobile business has grown in recent years from net revenue of 727 million in fiscal year 2020 and 718 million in fiscal year 2021 to 1059 million in fiscal year 2022 we expect new launches and acquired games and live services as well as expertise and technologies leveraged across our portfolio to drive further growth in mobile net revenue during fiscal year 2023 for example we expect to launch apex legends mobile  our first mobile experience based on the successful apex legends console and pc franchise in fiscal year 2023 and in fiscal year 2022 we acquired glu mobile inc and their portfolio of hit mobile franchises as well as playdemic limited makers of golf clash  one of the most successful ongoing mobile sports titles these acquisitions bring new mobile franchises and live services as well as the teams and technologies responsible for them to our mobile portfolio and organization 

we are focused on reaching more players whenever and wherever they want to play and promoting positive play as they engage with our games and services we aim to offer safe fun and inclusive environments in which to play for example in certain of our games and countries in which we operate we provide players with information about their engagement and tools that allow players or their parents more control of their experiences we also monitor gameplay for disruptive behaviors through reporting tools and detection models designed to flag offensive or inappropriate language and take action as needed 

we believe that we can add value to our network by making it easier for players to connect to a world of play by offering choice of business model distribution channel and device our games and services can be experienced on consoles pcs mobile phones tablets and reach our players through both digital distribution channels and retail channels players can access our games and services through traditional singlegame purchase or through subscription offerings and certain of our games and services are available through a “freetoplay” model whereby players download the game for free and engage with services provided on an ongoing basis for example we develop products and services within our global football franchise that allow players to engage through multiple business models distribution channels and devices including 1 our annualized console and pc games and associated services which can be purchased through both digital distribution and retail channels and also is available through subscription services 2 fifa mobile  a mobile freetoplay offering and 3 fifa online  a pc freetoplay game available in certain countries 

digitally our console games and live services can be purchased through thirdparty storefronts such as the digital stores of our console partners our direct sales to sony and microsoft represented approximately 33 percent and 16 percent of total net revenue respectively in fiscal year 2022 our mobile and tablet games and services are available through thirdparty application storefronts such as the apple app store and google play our pc games and services can be downloaded directly through origin ea’s digital storefront as well as through thirdparty online download stores such as steam we also partner with third parties to publish our mobile and pc games and services in certain asian territories such as our partnerships with tencent holdings limited for fifa online in china and nexon co ltd for fifa online in korea from time to time third parties will publish games and services under a license to certain of our intellectual property assets 

we also offer our ea play subscription service on consoles and pc as we look to build deeper relationships with our players and offer increased choice and flexibility for our players to try new games ea play allows players access to a selection of our console and pc games and services for a monthly or annual fee our packaged goods games are sold directly to mass market retailers specialty stores and through distribution arrangements new distribution methods and business models are expected to continue to emerge in the future and we intend to evaluate these opportunities on a casebycase basis 

our future opportunity 

we believe that the future of entertainment is interactive and that the consumption of entertainment and sports is deeply social with players across our network using games to stay connected to friends and to express themselves while we continue to anchor our business on delivering amazing content and services to more players whenever and wherever they want to play our goal is to build from our core alongside these secular shifts and invest in new areas of opportunity which we believe will translate into sustained growth these include 

• providing creation tools for the community to engage more deeply with our content and experiences 

• aggregating and distributing our content and experiences to more players on more platforms in more geographies and more business models and 

• harnessing the power of the social ecosystems in and around our games 

we believe that our future growth will be influenced by our ability to realize the potential of our core while at the same time creating growth around that core we aspire to create sociallyconnected ecosystems through which players can access amazing content experiences and tools that allow everyone to play watch and create together 

significant relationships 

sony  microsoft  under the terms of agreements we have entered into with sony interactive entertainment llc and its affiliates and with microsoft corporation and its affiliates we are authorized to develop market publish and distribute discbased products and services and we authorize sony and microsoft to distribute our digital products and services compatible with playstation and xbox consoles respectively under these agreements with sony and microsoft we have the nonexclusive right to use for a fixed term and in a designated territory technology that is owned or licensed by them to publish our games on their respective consoles with respect to our digitallydelivered products and services the console manufacturers pay us either a wholesale price or a royalty percentage on the revenue they derive from their sales of our products and services our transactions for packaged goods products are made pursuant to individual purchase orders which are accepted on a caseby case basis by sony or microsoft or their designated replicators as the case may be for packaged goods products we pay the console manufacturers a perunit royalty for each unit manufactured many key commercial terms of our relationships with sony and microsoft — such as manufacturing terms delivery times policies and approval conditions — are determined unilaterally and are subject to change by the console manufacturers 

the license agreements also require us to indemnify the console manufacturers for any loss liability and expense resulting from any claim against the console manufacturer regarding our games and services including any claims for patent copyright or trademark infringement brought against the console manufacturer each license may be terminated by the console manufacturer if a breach or default by us is not cured after we receive written notice from the console manufacturer or if we become insolvent the console manufacturers are not obligated to enter into license agreements with us for any future consoles products or services 

apple google and other app stores  we have agreements to distribute our mobile applications and additional content through distributors such as apple and google our applications are downloaded for mobile devices from third party application storefronts the distributor charges consumers for content purchased within the application or charges consumers a onetime fee to download the application our distribution agreements establish the amounts that are retained by the distributor and the amounts passed through to us these arrangements are typically terminable on short notice the agreements generally do not obligate the distributors to market or distribute any of our applications 

publishing partners in asia  we have entered into agreements whereby we partner with certain companies including tencent holdings limited and nexon co ltd or their respective affiliates pursuant to which these companies publish our mobile and pc freetoplay games in certain countries including china and korea our players access games from the publishers’ online storefronts and are charged for additional content purchased within our game environment the agreements generally establish the amounts that are retained by the publisher and the amounts passed through to us 

competition 

the market for interactive entertainment is intensely competitive and changes rapidly as new products business models and distribution channels are introduced we also face competition for the right to use certain intellectual property included in our products in order to remain successful we are required to anticipate sometimes years in advance the ways in which our products and services will compete in the market we face significant competition from companies such as activision blizzard taketwo interactive ubisoft epic games tencent netease netmarble warner brothers sony microsoft and nintendo primarily with respect to developing games and services that operate on consoles pcs andor mobile devices in addition the gaming technologyinternet social networking and entertainment industries have converged in recent years which has brought us into more direct competition with larger wellfunded technology companies such as amazoncom inc alphabet inc meta platforms inc microsoft corporation and netflix inc these companies have strengthened their interactive entertainment capabilities and we expect them to continue to do so their greater financial and other resources may provide larger budgets to develop and market tools technologies products and services that gain consumer success and shift player time and engagement away from our products and services we also continue to expect new entrants to emerge 

more broadly we compete against providers of different sources of entertainment such as movies television online casual entertainment and music that our players could enjoy in their free time important competitive factors in our industry include the ability to attract creative and technical talent game quality and ease of use innovation compatibility of products with certain consoles and other distribution channels brand recognition reputation reliability security creativity price marketing and quality of customer service 

recently our industry has undergone a period of increased consolidation which increases competitive pressure on us as interactive entertainment companies grow through acquisition – such as take two interactive’s recent acquisition of zynga – or as larger wellfunded technology companies strengthen their interactive entertainment capabilities – such as microsoft’s recently announced definitive agreement to acquire activision blizzard 

intellectual property and technology 

to establish and protect our intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyrights trademarks patents patent applications trade secrets knowhow license agreements confidentiality provisions and procedures and other contractual provisions we actively engage in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property but the laws of some countries in which we operate particularly in asia either do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the united states or are poorly enforced as our digital business has grown our games and services increasingly depend on the reliability availability and security of our technological infrastructure our industry is prone to and our systems and networks are subject to actions by malfeasant actors such as cyberattacks and other information security incidents including ransomware attacks while we devote financial and operational resources to implement systems processes and technologies to guard against cyber events and to help protect our intellectual property employee and consumer data and information technology systems against intrusions or other security breaches we have experienced such events in the past and expect future events to occur in addition we engage in activities designed to limit the impact of abuse of our digital products and services including monitoring our games for evidence of exploitation and rebalancing our game environments in the event that such abuse is discovered 

governmental regulation 

we are a global company subject to various and complex laws and regulations domestically and internationally including laws and regulations related to gaming user privacy data collection and retention consumer protection protection of minors online safety content advertising localization information security intellectual property competition sanctions addressing climate change taxation and employment among others many of these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing and the application to and impact on us is uncertain certain of our business models are subject to new laws or regulations or evolving interpretations and application of existing laws and regulations including those related to gambling the growth and development of electronic commerce virtual items and virtual currency has prompted calls for new laws and regulations and resulted in the application of existing laws or regulations that have limited or restricted the sale of our products and services in certain territories 

seasonality 

we have historically experienced the highest percentage of our net bookings in our third fiscal quarter due to seasonal holiday demand and the launch timing of our games while we expect this trend to continue in fiscal year 2023 there is no assurance that it will 

human capital 

an inclusive healthy and safe culture and diverse and engaged workforce is essential to our ability to execute our growth opportunities and build ongoing and meaningful relationships with our communities as a knowledgebased business our ability to attract train motivate and retain qualified employees is a critical factor in the successful development of our products and services as of march 31 2022 we employed approximately 12900 people globally with 64 percent located internationally our board and its committees oversee our human capital management programs practices and strategies and additional information on how they oversee these matters can be found in our annual proxy statement 

we are focused on supporting our employees across the full employee lifecycle and have implemented programs and practices designed to promote inclusion and diversity employee engagement and employee wellness for example we support employee resource groups “ergs” which are a critical component of our people strategy bringing together employees with common interests or backgrounds to develop themselves personally and professionally as well as supporting the company’s goals and objectives our ergs also celebrate allyship a critical component for connecting employees and creating a sense of belonging in addition to support our employees during the covid19 pandemic we have enhanced our programs to provide additional temporary support including payments to assist with work from home costs and care needs a pandemic care leave program and additional services for mental and physical health 

inclusion and diversity 

the global market for our products and services is diverse we believe that a diverse equitable and inclusive workplace that creates representative games and promotes positive play will engage a greater audience and lead to growth in our business and creating amazing games and services starts with a workplace that is as diverse as the communities we serve we work to embed inclusion across our systems and processes in order to 1 attract develop and retain talent that can thrive and do their best work 2 develop relatable content and games 3 enable expansion into new and diverse markets and 4 bridge to better representation that authentically reflects players around the world 

our most recently published companywide gender and racialethnic representation as well as our eeo1 report us government reporting are available on our website at httpswwweacomcommitmentsinclusionanddiversity to accelerate our progress with respect to representation we strive to 1 create inclusive people systems and practices with diversity equity and inclusion at the center 2 create a belonging culture that welcomes different viewpoints and enables employees to do the best work of their careers and 3 equip leaders with training and education that increases understanding and provides tools and behaviors to be inclusive managers 

our commitments to inclusion diversity and equity extend to compensating our employees fairly based on the work that they perform we consider our pay equity philosophy at each stage at which compensation decisions are made including when hiring and promoting employees and through our annual review cycle in addition we annually partner with an independent outside firm to review employees’ pay and promote fairness and a lack of unconscious bias in our compensation philosophy and practices resulting in equitable base pay 

talent acquisition development and retention 

our talent planning and hiring strategies are aligned with our strategic vision we are building a diverse and talented workforce to shape the future of our business and are committed to the development and growth of the next generation of diverse talent through community outreach and steam science technology engineering arts and mathematics education we are dedicated to recruitment hiring and development practices that promote the growth of underrepresented talent substantially all of our hiring includes diverse candidates in the initial pool and we go further by setting aspirational targets for the inclusion of candidates from underrepresented communities at later stages of the recruiting process that we believe can lead to better outcomes this strategic focus on hiring has led to positive hiring outcomes including at the executive level in each of the last four years we have hired underrepresented talent above our current representation rates 

we are focused on promoting the total wellness of our people and maintain resources programs and services to support employees physical mental familial and financial health we offer a wide range of benefits such as comprehensive health insurance and timeoff and leave programs including specialized programs around key life events 

all regular fulltime employees are asked to complete an engagement survey twice per year which helps ea understand how to improve the employee experience 81 percent of employees participated in our most recent engagement survey conducted in december 2021 we also conduct regular manager surveys and during fiscal year 2022 offered ongoing access to targeted surveys to better understand the needs of our employees as they navigated the covid19 pandemic results of all employee surveys are evaluated and shared across the organization including with our board of directors and inform opportunities for further improvement in our people practices

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance in the past we have experienced certain of the events and circumstances described below which adversely impacted our business and financial performance if any of the events or circumstances described below occur our business or financial performance could be harmed our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe could be material that may harm our business or financial performance 

strategic risks 

our business is intensely competitive we may not deliver successful and engaging products and services or consumers may prefer our competitors’ products or services over our own 

competition in our business is intense many new products and services are regularly introduced but only a relatively small number of products and associated services drive significant engagement and account for a significant portion of total revenue our competitors range from established interactive entertainment companies to emerging startups in addition the gaming technologyinternet and entertainment industries have converged in recent years and larger wellfunded technology companies have strengthened their interactive entertainment capabilities resulting in more direct competition with us we expect them to continue to pursue and strengthen these businesses their greater financial and other resources may provide larger budgets to recruit our key creative and technical talent develop and market products and services that gain consumer success and shift player time and engagement away from our products and services or otherwise disrupt our operations we also expect new competitors to continue to emerge throughout the world if our competitors develop more successful and engaging products or services offer competitive products or services at lower price points or if we do not continue to develop consistently highquality wellreceived and engaging products and services or if our marketing strategies are not innovative or fail to resonate with players particularly during key selling periods our revenue margins and profitability will decline 

we strive to create innovative and highquality products and services that allow us to build ongoing and meaningful relationships with our community however innovative and highquality titles even if highlyreviewed may not meet our expectations or the expectations of our players many financially successful products and services within our industry are iterations of prior titles with large established consumer bases and significant brand recognition which makes competing in certain categories challenging in addition products or services of our direct competitors or other entertainment companies may take a larger portion of consumer spending or time than we anticipate which could cause our products and services to underperform relative to our expectations a significant portion of our revenue historically has been derived from products and services based on a few popular franchises and the underperformance of a single major title has had and could in the future have a material adverse impact on our financial results for example we have historically derived a significant portion of our net revenue from sales related to our global football franchise annualized versions of which are consistently one of the bestselling games in the marketplace any events or circumstances that negatively impact our global football franchise such as product or service quality our transition to a new ea sports fc brand other products that take a portion of consumer spending and time the delay or cancellation of a product or service launch increased competition for key licenses or real or perceived security risks could negatively impact our financial results to a disproportionate extent 

the increased importance of live services including extra content to our business heightens the risks associated with the products for which such live services are offered live services that are either poorlyreceived or provided in connection with underperforming games may generate lower than expected sales any lapse delay or failure in our ability to provide highquality live services content to consumers over an extended period of time could materially and adversely affect our financial results consumer engagement with our live services and cause harm to our reputation and brand our most popular live services are the extra content available for the ultimate team mode associated with our sports franchises and extra content purchased within apex legends  any events or circumstances that negatively impact our ability to reliably provide content or sustain engagement for ultimate team  particularly fifa ultimate team  or apex legends  would negatively impact our financial results to a disproportionate extent 

we may not meet our product and live service development schedules and key events sports seasons andor movies that are tied to our product and live service release schedule may be delayed cancelled or poorly received 

our ability to meet product and live service development schedules is affected by a number of factors both within and outside our control including feedback from our players the creative processes involved the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams the complexity of our products and the platforms for which they are developed 

the need to finetune our products prior to their release factors related to the covid19 pandemic and in certain cases approvals from third parties we have experienced development delays for our products and services in the past which caused us to delay or cancel release dates any failure to meet anticipated production or release schedules likely would result in a delay of revenue andor possibly a significant shortfall in our revenue increase our development andor marketing expenses harm our profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different than anticipated if we miss key selling periods for products or services particularly the fiscal quarter ending in december for any reason including product delays or product cancellations our sales likely will suffer significantly 

we also seek to release certain products and extra content for our live services  such as our sports franchises and the associated ultimate team live service  in conjunction with key events such as the beginning of a sports season events associated with the sports calendar or the release of a related movie if such seasons or events were delayed cancelled or poorly received our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

our industry changes rapidly and we may fail to anticipate or successfully implement new or evolving technologies or adopt successful business strategies distribution methods or services 

rapid changes in our industry require us to anticipate sometimes years in advance the ways in which our business can remain competitive in the market we have invested and in the future may invest in new business and marketing strategies tools and technologies distribution methods products and services there can be no assurance that these strategic investments will achieve expected returns for example we are investing in our mobile business through seeking to maximize our mobile live services meaningfully expanding key franchises on the mobile platform and through mergers and acquisitions activity successfully monetizing mobile games is difficult and requires that we deliver valuable and entertaining player experiences that engage significant number of players or that we are able to otherwise monetize our mobile games the success of our mobile games depends in part on unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control including consumer preferences competing games new mobile platforms and the availability of other entertainment experiences such endeavors involve significant risks and uncertainties no assurance can be given that the tools and technology we choose to implement the business and marketing strategies we choose to adopt and the products services and platform strategies that we pursue will achieve financial results that meet or exceed our expectations our reputation and brand could also be adversely affected we also may miss opportunities or fail to respond quickly enough to industry change including the adoption of tools and technology or distribution methods or develop products services or new ways to engage with our games that become popular with consumers which could adversely affect our financial results 

our product and service development process usually starts with particular platforms and distribution methods in mind and a range of technical development feature and ongoing goals that we hope to be able to achieve we may not be able to achieve these goals or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly and in a way that better engages consumers in either case our products and services may be technologically inferior to those of our competitors less appealing to consumers or both if we cannot achieve our goals within the original development schedule for our products and services then we may delay their release until these goals can be achieved which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses alternatively we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies either to preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up with our competition which would increase our development expenses 

stakeholders have high expectations for the quality and integrity of our business culture products and services we may be unsuccessful in meeting these expectations or make business decisions to meet these expectations that impact our shortterm financial results 

expectations regarding the quality performance and integrity of our business culture products and services are high players and other stakeholders have sometimes been critical of our industry brands products services online communities business models andor practices for a wide variety of reasons including perceptions about gameplay fun fairness game content features or services or objections to certain of our practices these negative responses may not be foreseeable we also may not effectively manage our responses because of reasons within or outside of our control for example we have included in certain games the ability for players to purchase digital items including in some instances virtual “packs” “boxes” or “crates” that contain variable digital items the inclusion of variable digital items in certain games has attracted the attention of our community and if the future implementation of these features creates a negative perception of gameplay fairness or other negative perceptions our reputation and brand could be harmed and revenue could be negatively impacted in addition we have taken actions including delaying the release of our games and delaying or discontinuing content features and services for our games after taking into consideration among other things feedback from our community or geopolitical events even if those decisions negatively impacted our operating results in the short term for example in response to the current conflict in ukraine we stopped sales of our games and content in russia and belarus worked with our platform partners to remove our 

games and live services from their stores and took other actions these actions had a negative impact on our financial results and may impact our future development processes we expect to continue to take actions as appropriate including actions that may result in additional expenditures and the loss of revenue 

we aim to offer our players fun fair and safe environments in which to play and invest in and deploy tools and technologies to promote positive play and facilitate players’ faith in their gameplay experience although we expend resources and expect to continue to expend resources to promote positive play our efforts may not be successful due to scale limitations of existing technologies or other factors if our efforts are unsuccessful negative sentiment about our business may increase and our brand and reputation may be harmed scrutiny from governmental bodies and consumer groups may occur and our financial and operating results may be adversely impacted 

certain of our games and features on our platforms support online features that allow players and viewers to communicate with one another and post content in real time that is visible to other players and viewers from time to time this “user generated content” may contain objectionable and offensive content that is distributed and disseminated by third parties and our brands may be negatively affected by such actions if we fail to appropriately respond to the dissemination of such content we may be subject to lawsuits and governmental regulation our players may not engage with our products and services andor may lose confidence in our brands and our financial results may be adversely affected 

external game developers may not meet product development schedules or otherwise honor their obligations 

we contract with external game developers to develop our games or to publish or distribute their games while we maintain contractual protections we have less control over the product development schedules of games developed by external developers we depend on their ability to meet product development schedules which could be negatively affected by among other things distributed workforce models in addition disputes occasionally arise with external developers including with respect to game content launch timing achievement of certain milestones the game development timeline marketing campaigns contractual terms and interpretation if we have disputes with external developers or they cannot meet product development schedules acquire certain approvals or are otherwise unable or unwilling to honor their obligations to us we may delay or cancel previously announced games alter our launch schedule or experience increased costs and expenses which could result in a delay or significant shortfall in anticipated revenue harm our profitability and reputation and cause our financial results to be materially affected 

our business depends on the success and availability of consoles systems and devices developed by third parties and our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for those consoles systems and devices 

the success of our business is driven in part by the commercial success and adequate supply of thirdparty consoles systems and devices for which we develop our products and services or through which our products and services are distributed our success depends in part on accurately predicting which consoles systems and devices will be successful in the marketplace and providing engaging and commercially successful games and services for those consoles systems and devices we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of the commercial availability of new consoles systems and devices and we may incur significant expense to adjust our product portfolio and development efforts in response to changing consumer preferences we may enter into certain exclusive licensing arrangements that affect our ability to deliver or market products or services on certain consoles systems or devices a console system or device for which we are developing products and services may not succeed as expected and we may be unable to fully recover the investments we have made in developing our products and services or new consoles systems or devices may take market share away from those for which we have devoted significant resources causing us to not be able to reach our intended audience and take advantage of meaningful revenue opportunities 

in fiscal year 2021 our key console partners sony and microsoft each released new generation consoles in periods of transition sales of products for legacy generation consoles typically slow or decline in response to the introduction of new consoles and sales of products for new generation consoles typically stabilize only after new consoles are widelyestablished with the consumer base this console transition may have a comparable impact on our live services business potentially increasing the impact on our financial results the transition could accelerate faster or slower than we expect for example production of new generation consoles from sony and microsoft has been slower than expected because of semiconductor chip shortages and global supply chain disruptions we do not control the unit volumes of consoles made available for sale the pricing or appeal of new generation consoles or the rates at which consumers purchase these consoles for a period of time we will also develop market and operate games and services on both legacy and new generation consoles simultaneously as a result of these factors our operating results during console transitions may be more volatile and difficult to predict 

we may experience declines or fluctuations in the reoccurring portion of our business 

our business model includes revenue that we deem reoccurring in nature such as revenue from our annualized sports franchises eg madden nfl global football our console pc and mobile catalog titles ie titles that did not launch in the current fiscal year and our live services while we have been able to forecast the revenue from these areas of our business with greater relative confidence than for new games services and business models we cannot provide assurances that consumer demand will remain consistent including in connection with circumstances outside of our control furthermore we may cease to offer games and services that we previously had deemed to be reoccurring in nature consumer demand has declined and fluctuated and could in the future decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their level of satisfaction with our games and services our ability to improve and innovate our annualized titles our ability to adapt our games and services to new distribution channels and business models outages and disruptions of online services the games and services offered by our competitors our marketing and advertising efforts or declines in consumer activity generally as a result of economic downturns among others the reception to our sports games also depends in part on the popularity reputation and brand of the leagues organizations and individual athletes with whom we partner events and circumstances outside of our control that have a negative impact on the accessibility popularity reputation and brand of these partners has impacted and could in the future negatively impact sales related to our annualized sports games any decline or fluctuation in the reoccurring portion of our business may have a negative impact on our financial and operating results 

we could fail to successfully adopt new business models 

from time to time we seek to establish and implement new business models forecasting the success of any new business model is inherently uncertain and depends on a number of factors both within and outside of our control our actual revenue and profit for these businesses may be significantly greater or less than our forecasts in addition these new business models could fail resulting in the loss of our investment in the development and infrastructure needed to support these new business models as well as the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from more successful and established businesses for example we have devoted financial and operational resources to our subscription offerings without any assurance that these businesses will be financially successful while we anticipate growth in this area of our business consumer demand is difficult to predict any failure to successfully implement new business models could materially impact our financial and operating results 

acquisitions investments divestitures and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and other negative consequences 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions including 1 acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets 2 investments in or transactions with strategic partners and 3 investments in new businesses as part of our longterm business strategy these acquisitions and other transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or strategic goals that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment or cannot realize anticipated tax benefits that we acquire liabilities andor litigation from acquired companies or liabilities andor litigation results from the transactions that our due diligence process does not identify significant issues liabilities or other challenges diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses and the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses in addition we may not integrate these businesses successfully or achieve expected synergies for example we may experience difficulties and costs associated with the integration of business systems and technologies and acquired products and services the integration and retention of new employees the implementation of our internal control and compliance procedures andor the remediation of the internal control and compliance environment of the acquired entity or the maintenance of key business and customer relationships these events could harm our operating results or financial condition 

we may fund strategic transactions with 1 cash which would reduce cash available for other corporate purposes 2 debt which would increase our interest expense and leverage andor 3 equity which would dilute current shareholders’ percentage ownership and also dilute our earnings per share we also may divest or sell assets or a business and we may have difficulty selling such assets or business on acceptable terms in a timely manner this could result in a delay in the achievement of our strategic objectives cause us to incur additional expense or the sale of such assets or business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we anticipated 

we may be unable to maintain or acquire licenses to include intellectual property owned by others in our games or to maintain or acquire the rights to publish or distribute games developed by others 

many of our products and services are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our ea sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues teams and players’ associations and our star wars products include rights licensed from disney competition for these licenses and rights is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses and rights or obtain additional licenses or rights with significant commercial value our ability to develop successful and engaging products and services may be adversely affected and our revenue profitability and cash flows may decline significantly other competitors may assume certain licenses and create competing products impacting our sales competition for these licenses has increased and may continue to increase the amounts that we must pay to licensors and developers through higher minimum guarantees or royalty rates which could significantly increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

our business partners may be unable to honor their obligations to us or their actions may put us at risk 

we rely on various business partners including platform partners thirdparty service providers vendors licensing partners development partners and licensees their actions may put our business and our reputation and brand at risk for example we may have disputes with our business partners that may impact our business andor financial results in many cases our business partners may be given access to sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support and they may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it in addition the failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies or the failure of the third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies could result in a disruption to our business operations further disruptions in the financial markets economic downturns poor business decisions or reputational harm may adversely affect our business partners and they may not be able to continue honoring their obligations to us or we may cease our arrangements with them alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner or vendor if we lose one or more significant business partners our business could be harmed and our financial results could be materially affected 

operational risks 

the covid19 pandemic and the various responses to it have affected how we are operating our business and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future operations and financial results is uncertain 

the covid19 pandemic and the various responses to it have affected how we and our partners are operating our businesses and have affected our operating results the duration and extent to which this will impact our future operations and results remains uncertain we have established and continue to maintain protocols to promote the health and safety of our workforce and business partners we are beginning to reopen our office locations and resume business travel as it is appropriate to do so consistent with the health and safety of our employees and in compliance with any local legal restrictions or requirements the reintroduction of employees to the workplace could introduce operational risk negatively impact productivity and give rise to claims by employees or otherwise adversely affect our business as we begin to reopen our offices employees may be offered more flexibility in the amount of time they work in an office which may adversely impact the productivity of certain employees the longterm effects of the covid19 pandemic on the future of work are not certain and may present operational challenges and impact our ability to attract and retain talent and our teams’ ability to collaborate creatively each of which may adversely affect our business 

certain of our development teams have worked for an extended period in a distributed environment whereas these teams historically collaborated inperson on the creative and technical process required to develop highquality products and services at scale this has disrupted and may continue to disrupt the productivity of our workforce and the creative process to which our teams are accustomed companies in our industry have experienced issues related to game and service quality during the current workfromhome period and we have changed the launch date of key products because of challenges associated with a distributed development environment in addition the longerterm impact to our creative and technical development processes is unknown and the associated risks including with respect to game quality and developmental delays which may cause us to delay or cancel additional release dates may be heightened as the workfromhome period persists 

the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time such as the duration and spread of the pandemic future waves of covid19 infections and variants the extent speed and effectiveness of worldwide containment and vaccination efforts and the impact of these and other factors on our employees customers partners and vendors if we are not able to flexibly respond to and manage the impact of these and other currently unknown impacts related to the covid19 pandemic our business will be harmed 

to the extent that the covid19 pandemic harms our business and results of operations many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section may be heightened 

catastrophic events may disrupt our business 

natural disasters cyberincidents weather events wildfires power disruptions telecommunications failures pandemics health crises and other public health events failed upgrades of existing systems or migrations to new systems acts of terrorism or other events could cause outages disruptions andor degradations of our infrastructure including our or our partners’ information technology and network systems a failure in our ability to conduct normal business operations or the closure of public spaces in which players engage with our games and services the health and safety of our employees players thirdparty organizations with whom we partner or regulatory agencies on which we rely could be also affected any of which may prevent us from executing against our business strategies andor cause a decrease in consumer demand for our products and services 

we recognize the inherent physical risks associated with climate change natural disasters and weather events linked to climate change are increasing in size and scope and certain of our office locations are located in areas that are vulnerable to climate change effects climaterelated events and their impact on critical infrastructure in areas in which we do business have the potential to disrupt our business and operations andor the businesses and operations of our partners and may cause us to incur additional costs to maintain or resume operations 

system redundancy may be ineffective and our disaster recovery and business continuity planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures disruptions closures or inability to conduct normal business operations could also prevent access to our products services or online stores selling our products and services cause delay or interruption in our product or live services offerings allow breaches of data security or result in the loss of critical data our corporate headquarters and several of our key studios also are located in seismically active regions an event that results in the disruption or degradation of any of our critical business functions or information technology systems harms our ability to conduct normal business operations or causes a decrease in consumer demand for our products and services could materially impact our reputation and brand financial condition and operating results 

we have and may continue to experience security breaches and cyber threats 

the integrity of our and our partners’ information technology networks and systems is critical to our ongoing operations products and services our industry is prone to and our systems and networks are subject to actions by malfeasant actors which may include individuals or groups including statesponsored attackers these actions include cyberattacks including ransomware and other information security incidents that seek to exploit disable damage andor disrupt our networks business operations products and services and supporting technological infrastructure or gain access to consumer and employee personal information our intellectual property and other assets in addition our systems and networks could be harmed or improperly accessed due to error by employees or third parties that are authorized to access these networks and systems we also rely on technological infrastructure provided by thirdparty business partners to support the online functionality of our products and services who are also subject to these same cyber risks both our partners and we have expended and expect to continue to expend financial and operational resources to guard against cyber risks and to help protect our data and systems however the techniques used by malfeasant actors change frequently continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and often are not detected for long periods of time 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic remote access to our networks and systems and the networks and systems of our partners has increased substantially we expect to resume operations in our offices under a hybrid work model where our workforce will spend a portion of their time working in offices and a portion of time working remotely while we and our partners have taken steps to secure our networks and systems these networks and systems may be more vulnerable to a successful cyberattack or information security incident in this hybrid working model the costs to respond to mitigate andor notify affected parties of cyberattacks and other security vulnerabilities are significant it may also be necessary for us to take additional extraordinary measures and make additional expenditures to take appropriate responsive and preventative steps in addition such events could compromise the confidentiality integrity or accessibility of these networks and systems or result in the compromise or loss of the data including personal data processed by these systems consequences of such events responsive measures and preventative measures have included and could in the future include the loss of proprietary and personal data and interruptions or delays in our business operations exploitation of our data as well as loss of player confidence and damage to our brand and reputation financial expenses and financial loss in addition such events could cause us to be noncompliant with applicable regulations and subject us to legal claims or penalties under laws protecting the privacy or security of personal information or proprietary material information we have experienced such events in the past and expect future events to occur 

in addition the virtual economies that we have established in many of our games are subject to abuse exploitation and other forms of fraudulent activity that can negatively impact our business virtual economies involve the use of virtual currency andor virtual assets that can be used or redeemed by a player within a particular game or service the abuse or exploitation of our virtual economies have included the illegitimate or unauthorized generation and sale of virtual items including in black markets our online services have been impacted by ingame exploits and the use of automated or other fraudulent processes designed to generate virtual items or currency illegitimately or to execute account takeover attacks against our players we anticipate such activity to continue these abuses and exploits and the steps that we take to address these abuses and exploits may result in a loss of anticipated revenue increased costs to protect against or remediate these issues interfere with players’ enjoyment of a balanced game environment or cause harm to our reputation and brand 

we may experience outages disruptions or degradations in our services products andor technological infrastructure 

the reliable performance of our products and services depends on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology systems and those of our external service providers including thirdparty “cloud” computing services our games and services are complex software products and maintaining the sophisticated internal and external technological infrastructure required to reliably deliver these games and services is expensive and complicated the reliable delivery and stability of our products and services has been and could in the future be adversely impacted by outages disruptions failures or degradations in our network and related infrastructure as well as in the online platforms or services of key business partners that offer support or host our products and services in addition the supply chain of hardware needed to maintain this technological infrastructure has been disrupted and geopolitical events including the russian invasion of ukraine and any indirect effects may further complicate existing supply chain constraints the reliability and stability of our products and services has been affected by events outside of our control as well as by events within our control such as the migration of data among data centers and to thirdparty hosted environments the performance of upgrades and maintenance on our systems and online demand for our products and services that exceeds the capabilities of our technological infrastructure 

if we or our external business partners were to experience an event that caused a significant system outage disruption or degradation or if a transition among data centers or service providers or an upgrade or maintenance session encountered unexpected interruptions unforeseen complexity or unplanned disruptions our products and services may not be available to consumers or may not be delivered reliably and stably as a result our reputation and brand may be harmed consumer engagement with our products and services may be reduced and our revenue and profitability could be negatively impacted we do not have redundancy for all our systems many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities 

as our digital business grows we will require an increasing amount of internal and external technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy the needs of our players we are investing and expect to continue to invest in our own technology hardware and software and the technology hardware and software of external service providers to support our business it is possible that we may fail to scale effectively and grow this technical infrastructure to accommodate increased demands which may adversely affect the reliable and stable performance of our games and services therefore negatively impacting engagement reputation brand and revenue growth 

attracting managing and retaining our talent is critical to our success 

our business depends on our ability to attract train motivate and retain executive technical creative marketing and other personnel that are essential to the development marketing and support of our products and services the market for highlyskilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive particularly in the geographic locations in which many of our key personnel are located and has recently intensified further due to industry trends in addition our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting our executives as well as key creative and technical talent we strive to provide a workplace culture that is diverse equitable inclusive and safe and have invested in policies practices tools and people in this regard if we cannot successfully recruit train motivate and retain qualified employees develop and maintain a diverse equitable inclusive and safe work environment or replace key employees following their departure our reputation and brand may be negatively impacted and our ability to develop and manage our business will be impaired 

we rely on the consoles systems and devices of partners who have significant influence over the products and services that we offer in the marketplace 

a significant percentage of our digital net revenue is attributable to sales of products and services through our significant partners including sony microsoft apple and google the concentration of a material portion of our digital sales in these partners exposes us to risks associated with these businesses any deterioration in the businesses of our significant partners 

could disrupt and harm our business including by limiting the methods through which our digital products and services are offered and exposing us to collection risks 

in addition our license agreements typically provide these partners with significant control over the approval and distribution of the products and services that we develop for their consoles systems and devices for products and services delivered via digital channels each respective partner has policies and guidelines that control the promotion and distribution of these titles and the features and functionalities that we are permitted to offer through the channel our partners could choose to exclude our products and services from or deemphasize the promotion of our products and services within some or all of their distribution channels in order to promote their own products and services or those of our competitors in addition we are dependent on these partners to invest in and upgrade the capabilities of their systems in a manner that corresponds to the preferences of consumers failure by these partners to keep pace with consumer preferences could have an adverse impact on the engagement with our products and services and our ability to merchandise and commercialize our products and services which could harm our business andor financial results 

moreover certain significant partners can determine and change unilaterally certain key terms and conditions including the ability to change their user and developer policies and guidelines in many cases these partners also set the rates that we must pay to provide our games and services through their online channels and retain flexibility to change their fee structures or adopt different fee structures for their online channels which could adversely impact our costs profitability and margins these partners also control the information technology systems through which online sales of our products and service channels are captured if our partners establish terms that restrict our offerings significantly impact the financial terms on which these products or services are offered to our customers or their information technology systems experience outages that impact our players’ ability to access our games or purchase extra content or cause an unanticipated delay in reporting our business andor financial results could be materially affected 

a significant portion of our packaged goods sales are made to a relatively small number of retail and distribution partners and these sales may be disrupted 

we derive a significant percentage of our net revenue attributable to sales of our packaged goods products to our top retail and distribution partners the concentration of a significant percentage of these sales through a few large partners could lead to a shortterm disruption to our business if certain of these partners significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to offer our products the financial position of certain partners has deteriorated and while we maintain protections such as monitoring the credit extended to these partners we could be vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these partners experienced continued deterioration of their business or declared bankruptcy additionally receivables from these partners generally increase in our december fiscal quarter as sales of our products generally increase in anticipation of the holiday season which exposes us to heightened risk at that time of year having a significant portion of our packaged goods sales concentrated in a few partners could reduce our negotiating leverage with them if one or more of these partners experience deterioration in their business or become unable to obtain sufficient financing to maintain their operations our business could be harmed 

the products or services we release may contain defects bugs or errors 

our products and services are extremely complex software programs and are difficult to develop and distribute we have quality controls in place to detect defects bugs or other errors in our products and services before they are released nonetheless these quality controls are subject to human error overriding and resource or technical constraints in addition the effectiveness of our quality controls and preventative measures may be negatively affected by the distribution of our workforce resulting from the covid19 pandemic as such these quality controls and preventative measures may not be effective in detecting all defects bugs or errors in our products and services before they have been released into the marketplace in such an event the technological reliability and stability of our products and services could be below our standards and the standards of our players and our reputation brand and sales could be adversely affected in addition we could be required to or may find it necessary to offer a refund for the product or service suspend the availability or sale of the product or service or expend significant resources to cure the defect bug or error each of which could significantly harm our business and operating results 

legal and compliance risks 

our business is subject to complex and prescriptive regulations regarding consumer protection and data privacy practices and could be adversely affected if our consumer protection data privacy and security practices are not adequate or perceived as being inadequate 

we are subject to global data privacy data protection localization security and consumerprotection laws and regulations worldwide these laws and regulations are emerging and evolving and the interpretation and application of these laws and 

regulations often are uncertain contradictory and changing the failure to maintain data practices that are compliant with applicable laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of applicable laws and regulations could result in inquiries from enforcement agencies or direct consumer complaints resulting in civil or criminal penalties and could adversely impact our reputation and brand in addition the operational costs of compliance with these regulations is high and will likely continue to increase even if we remain in strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations consumer sensitivity to the collection and processing of their personal information continues to increase any real or perceived failures in maintaining acceptable data privacy practices including allowing improper or unauthorized access acquisition or misuse andor uninformed disclosure of consumer employee and other information or a perception that we do not adequately secure this information or provide consumers with adequate notice about the information that they authorize us to collect and disclose could result in brand reputational or other harms to the business result in costly remedial measures deter current and potential customers from using our products and services and cause our financial results to be materially affected 

third party vendors and business partners receive access to certain information that we collect these vendors and business partners may not prevent data security breaches with respect to the information we provide them or fully enforce our policies contractual obligations and disclosures regarding the collection use storage transfer and retention of personal data a data security breach of one of our vendors or business partners could cause reputational and financial harm to them and us negatively impact our ability to offer our products and services and could result in legal liability costly remedial measures governmental and regulatory investigations harm our profitability reputation and brand andor cause our financial results to be materially affected 

we also are subject to payment card association rules and obligations pursuant to contracts with payment card processors under these rules and obligations if information is compromised we could be liable to payment card issuers for the cost of associated expenses and penalties in addition if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards even if no consumer information is compromised we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs 

government regulations applicable to us may negatively impact our business 

we are a global company subject to various and complex laws and regulations domestically and internationally including laws and regulations related to consumer protection protection of minors online safety content advertising localization information security intellectual property competition sanctions addressing climate change taxation and employment among others many of these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing and the application to and impact on us is uncertain these laws could harm our business by limiting the products and services we can offer consumers or the manner in which we offer them the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in applicable laws or changes to interpretation any failure on our part to comply with these laws or the application of these laws in an unanticipated manner may harm our business and result in penalties or significant legal liability 

certain of our business models and features within our games and services are subject to new laws or regulations or evolving interpretations and application of existing laws and regulations including those related to gambling the growth and development of electronic commerce virtual items and virtual currency has prompted calls for new laws and regulations and resulted in the application of existing laws or regulations that have limited or restricted the sale of our products and services in certain territories for example governmental organizations have applied existing laws and regulations to certain mechanics commonly included within our games including the ultimate team mode associated with our sports franchises in addition we include modes in our games that allow players to compete against each other and manage player competitions that are based on our products and services although we structure and operate our skillbased competitions with applicable laws in mind including those related to gambling our skillbased competitions in the future could become subject to evolving laws and regulations we are also introducing features into our games and services that allow players to create and share usergenerated content such content may be objectionable or offensive and decrease engagement with our products and services cause a loss of confidence in our brands and expose us to liability and regulatory oversight particularly as applicable global laws and regulations are introduced and evolve new laws related to these business models and features or the interpretation or application of current laws could subject us to additional regulation and oversight cause us to further limit or restrict the sale of our products and services or otherwise impact our products and services lessen the engagement with and growth of profitable business models and expose us to increased compliance costs significant liability fines penalties and harm to our reputation and brand 

we are subject to laws in certain foreign countries and adhere to industry standards in the united states that mandate rating requirements or set other restrictions on the advertisement or distribution of interactive entertainment software based on content in addition certain foreign countries allow government censorship of interactive entertainment software products or require preapproval processes of uncertain length before our games and services can be offered adoption of ratings systems 

censorship restrictions on distribution and changes to approval processes or the status of any approvals could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our consumers in addition compliance with new and possibly inconsistent regulations for different territories could be costly delay or prevent the release of our products in those territories 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights 

from time to time third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights although we take steps to avoid knowingly violating the intellectual property rights of others it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement existing or future infringement claims against us may be expensive to defend and divert the attention of our employees from business operations such claims or litigation could require us to pay damages and other costs we also could be required to stop selling distributing or supporting products features or services which incorporate the affected intellectual property rights redesign products features or services to avoid infringement or obtain a license all of which could be costly and harm our business 

in addition many patents have been issued that may apply to potential new modes of delivering playing or monetizing products and services such as those that we produce or would like to offer in the future we may discover that future opportunities to provide new and innovative modes of game play and game delivery may be precluded by existing patents that we are unable to acquire or license on reasonable terms 

from time to time we may become involved in other legal proceedings 

we are currently and from time to time in the future may become subject to legal proceedings claims litigation and government investigations or inquiries which could be expensive lengthy disruptive to normal business operations and occupy a significant amount of our employees’ time and attention in addition the outcome of any legal proceedings claims litigation investigations or inquiries may be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating results or financial condition 

our products and brands are subject to intellectual property infringement including in jurisdictions that do not adequately protect our products and intellectual property rights 

we regard our products brands and intellectual property as proprietary and take measures to protect our assets from infringement we are aware that some unauthorized copying of our products and brands occurs and if a significantly greater amount were to occur it could negatively impact our business further our products and services are available worldwide and the laws of some countries particularly in asia either do not protect our products brands and intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the united states or are poorly enforced legal protection of our rights may be ineffective in countries with weaker intellectual property enforcement mechanisms in addition certain third parties have registered our intellectual property rights without authorization in foreign countries successfully registering such intellectual property rights could limit or restrict our ability to offer products and services based on such rights in those countries although we take steps to enforce and police our rights our practices and methodologies may not be effective against all eventualities 

financial risks 

our financial results are subject to currency and interest rate fluctuations 

international sales are a fundamental part of our business for our fiscal year ended march 31 2022 international net revenue comprised 57 percent of our total net revenue and we expect our international business to continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue as a result of our international sales and also the denomination of our foreign investments and our cash and cash equivalents in foreign currencies we are exposed to the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates remains elevated as compared to historic levels strengthening of the us dollar particularly relative to the euro british pound sterling australian dollar japanese yen chinese yuan south korean won and polish zloty has a negative impact on our reported international net revenue but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses particularly when the us dollar strengthens against the swedish krona and the canadian dollar because these amounts are translated at lower rates we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency risk however these activities are limited in the protection they provide us from foreign currency fluctuations and can themselves result in losses in addition interest rate volatility can decrease the amount of interest earned on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment portfolio 

we utilize debt financing and such indebtedness could adversely impact our business and financial condition 

we have 19 billion in senior unsecured notes outstanding as well as an unsecured 500 million revolving credit facility while the facility is currently undrawn we may use the proceeds of any future borrowings for general corporate purposes we may also enter into other financial instruments in the future 

this indebtedness and any indebtedness that we may incur in the future could affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

• requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow for other purposes including capital expenditures share repurchases acquisitions or otherwise funding our growth strategy 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and 

• increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business or adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions 

the agreements governing our indebtedness impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants in particular the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with a debt to ebitda ratio our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of these covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable there can be no assurance that any refinancing or additional financing would be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us if at all in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities as well as the potential costs associated with any potential refinancing of our indebtedness downgrades in our credit rating could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities and changes to tax laws and interpretations of tax laws could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision tax assets and accruals for other taxes and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective income tax rate is based in part on our corporate operating structure and the manner in which we operate our business and develop value and use our intellectual property taxing authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate have challenged and audited and may continue to challenge and audit our methodologies for calculating our income taxes which could increase our effective income tax rate and have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows in addition our provision for income taxes is materially affected by our profit levels changes in our business changes in our geographic mix of earnings changes in the elections we make changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in our corporate structure changes in applicable accounting rules or changes in applicable tax laws or interpretations of existing income and withholding tax laws as well as other factors the impact of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies could result in significant fluctuations to our effective tax rate 

changes to us federal state or international tax laws or their applicability to corporate multinationals in the countries in which we do business particularly in switzerland where our international business is headquartered and actions we have taken in our business with respect to such laws have affected and could continue to affect our effective tax rates and cash taxes and could cause us to change the way in which we structure our business and result in other costs in particular recently proposed changes to tax regulations in the united states and among the countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development could materially impact our provision for income taxes and cash taxes our effective tax rate also could be adversely affected by changes in our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets our valuation allowances in turn can be impacted by several factors with respect to our business and industry significant judgment is involved in determining the amount of valuation allowances and actual financial results also may differ materially from our current estimates and could have a material impact on our assessments 

we are required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property transfer and goods and services taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions several foreign jurisdictions have introduced new digital services taxes on revenue of companies that provide certain digital services or expanded their interpretation of existing tax laws with regard to other nonincome taxes there is limited guidance about the applicability of these new taxes or changing interpretations to our business and significant uncertainty as to what will be deemed in scope if these foreign taxes are applied to us it could have an adverse and material impact on our business and financial performance 

general risks 

our business is subject to economic market public health and geopolitical conditions 

our business is subject to economic market public health and geopolitical conditions which are beyond our control the united states and other international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time worsening economic conditions political instability and adverse political developments in or around any of the countries in which we do business particularly conditions that negatively impact discretionary consumer spending and consumer demand or increase our operating costs including conflict inflation slower growth recession and other macroeconomic conditions have had and could continue to have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results in addition relations between the united states and countries in which we have operations and sales have fluctuated over time resulting in the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions including economic sanctions that have a negative impact on our financial results and development processes 

we are particularly susceptible to market conditions and risks associated with the entertainment industry which in addition to general macroeconomic downturns also include the popularity price and timing of our games changes in consumer demographics the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to our operating results or factors specific to our operating results including those discussed in the risk factors above as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our future financial performance ratings or recommendations our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts’ and investors’ expectations the failure of our capital return programs to meet analysts’ and investors’ expectations the announcement and integration of any acquisitions we may make departure of key personnel cyberattacks or factors largely outside of our control including those affecting interactive gaming entertainment andor technology companies generally national or international economic conditions investor sentiment or other factors related or unrelated to our operating performance in particular economic downturns may contribute to the public stock markets experiencing extreme price and trading volume volatility these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

trends in our business 

covid19 impact  we continue to monitor the impact of the covid19 pandemic to our people and our business since the initial outbreak we have focused on actions to support our people our players and communities around the world that have been affected by the covid19 pandemic the wellbeing of our people is our top priority as conditions continue to fluctuate around the world we are reopening our office locations and resuming business travel as it is appropriate to do so consistent with the health and safety of our employees and in compliance with any local legal restrictions or requirements during the pandemic longerterm trends that benefit our business accelerated live services and other net revenue has increased and we have also experienced a significant increase in the percentage of our games purchased digitally over the past two fiscal years 

these trends may not be indicative of results for future periods particularly if the trend towards digital adoption decelerates or as a result of global macroeconomic effects related or unrelated to the covid19 pandemic see the section titled “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this annual report for further discussion of the possible impact of the covid19 pandemic to our workforce and business 

live services business we offer our players highquality experiences designed to provide value to players and to extend and enhance gameplay these live services include extra content subscription offerings and other revenue generated in addition to the sale of our base games and freetoplay games our net revenue attributable to live services and other was 4998 million 4016 million and 3650 million for fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively and we expect that live services net revenue will continue to be material to our business within live services and other net revenue attributable to extra content was 3910 million 3068 million and 2826 million for fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively extra content net revenue has increased as more players engage with our games and services and purchase additional content designed to provide value to players and extend and enhance gameplay our most popular live services are the extra content purchased for the ultimate team mode associated with our sports franchises and extra content purchased for our apex legends franchise ultimate team allows players to collect current and former professional players in order to build and compete as a personalized team live services net revenue generated from extra content purchased within the ultimate team mode associated with our sports franchises a substantial portion of which was derived from fifa ultimate team  and for our apex legends franchise is material to our business 

digital delivery of games in our industry players increasingly purchase games digitally as opposed to purchasing physical discs while this trend as applied to our business may not be linear because of product mix during a fiscal year consumer buying patterns and other factors over time we expect players to purchase an increasingly higher proportion of our games digitally therefore we expect net revenue attributable to digital full game downloads to increase over time and net revenue attributable to sales of packaged goods to decrease 

our net revenue attributable to digital full game downloads was 1282 million 918 million and 811 million during fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively while our net revenue attributable to packaged goods sales decreased from 1076 million in fiscal year 2020 to 695 million in fiscal year 2021 and 711 million in fiscal year 2022 in addition as measured based on total units sold on microsoft’s xbox one and xbox series x and sony’s playstation 4 and 5 rather than by net revenue we estimate that 65 percent 62 percent and 49 percent of our total units sold during fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 were sold digitally digital full game units are based on sales information provided by microsoft and sony packaged goods units sold through are estimated by obtaining data from significant retail partners in north america europe and asia and applying internal sales estimates with respect to retail partners from which we do not obtain data we believe that these percentages are reasonable estimates of the proportion of our games that are digitally downloaded in relation to our total number of units sold for the applicable period of measurement 

increases in consumer adoption of digital purchase of games combined with increases in our live services revenue generally results in expansion of our gross margin as costs associated with selling a game digitally is generally less than selling the same game through traditional retail and distribution channels 

increased competition competition in our business is intense our competitors range from established interactive entertainment companies to emerging startups in addition the gaming technologyinternet and entertainment industries have converged in recent years and larger wellfunded technology companies have strengthened their interactive entertainment capabilities resulting in more direct competition with us for example companies such as amazoncom inc alphabet inc meta platforms inc microsoft corporation and netflix inc have increased investment and resources dedicated to interactive entertainment capabilities we expect them to continue to pursue and strengthen these businesses their greater financial or other resources may provide larger budgets to develop and market tools technologies products and services that gain consumer success and shift player time and engagement away from our products and services in addition our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting our executives as well as key creative and technical talent resulting in retention challenges and increased cost to retain and incentivize our key people 

recently our industry has undergone a period of increased consolidation which increases competitive pressure on us as interactive entertainment companies grow through acquisition – such as take two interactive’s recent acquisition of zynga – or as larger wellfunded technology companies strengthen their interactive entertainment capabilities – such as microsoft’s recently announced definitive agreement to acquire activision blizzard 

freetoplay games the global adoption of mobile devices and a business model for those devices that allows consumers to try new games with no upfront cost and that are monetized through a live service associated with the game particularly extra content sales has led to significant sales growth in the mobile gaming industry similarly sales of extra content are the primary driver of our mobile business we are investing resources in our mobile business seeking to maximize our mobile live services innovate on mobile with our franchises and through mergers and acquisitions activity have brought new mobile franchises and live services as well as the teams and technologies responsible for them to our mobile portfolio and organization we expect these factors to drive growth in mobile net revenue in fiscal 2023 likewise the consumer acceptance of freetoplay live servicebased online pc and console games has broadened our consumer base and has begun to expand into the console market for example within our business we offer apex legends as a freetoplay live servicebased pc and console game we expect extra content revenue generated from mobile pc and console freetoplay games to continue to be an important part of our business 

concentration of sales among the most popular games  in all major segments of our industry we see a large portion of games sales concentrated on the most popular titles similarly a significant portion of our revenue historically has been derived from games based on a few popular franchises several of which we have released on an annual or biannual basis in particular we have historically derived a significant portion of our net revenue from our global football franchise the annualized version of which is consistently one of the bestselling games in the marketplace we have invested in over 300 individual partnerships and licenses to create our global football ecosystem and starting in fiscal year 2024 our global football franchise will transition to a new ea sports fc brand our vision for the future of interactive football with ea sports fc is to create the largest football club in the world and we believe this is the right opportunity for us so that we can continue delivering innovation and growing to connect more fans on a global scale for years to come 

reoccurring revenue sources our business model includes revenue that we deem reoccurring in nature such as revenue from our annualized sports franchises eg global football madden nfl our console pc and mobile catalog titles ie titles that did not launch in the current fiscal year and our live services we have been able to forecast revenue from these areas of our business with greater relative confidence than for new games services and business models as we continue to incorporate new business models and modalities of play into our games our goal is to continue to look for opportunities to expand the reoccurring portion of our business 

net bookings  in order to improve transparency into our business we disclose an operating performance metric net bookings net bookings is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or soldin physically in the period net bookings is calculated by adding total net revenue to the change in deferred net revenue for onlineenabled games 

the following is a calculation of our total net bookings for the periods presented 

net bookings were 7515 million for fiscal year 2022 primarily driven by sales related to our fifa franchise apex legends  madden nfl 22  and the sims 4  net bookings increased 1325 million or 21 percent as compared to fiscal year 2021 primarily due to increased yearoveryear sales for apex legends and the fifa franchise and new games added to our portfolio through acquisitions activity including f1 2021 and several mobile titles partially offset by the star wars franchise and the sims 4 live services and other net bookings were 5370 million for fiscal year 2022 and increased 778 million or 17 percent as compared to fiscal year 2021 the increase in live services and other net bookings was due primarily to an increase in sales of extra content for apex legends  sales of extra content for new games added to our mobile portfolio through acquisitions activity and sales of extra content for fifa ultimate team  full game net bookings were 2145 million for fiscal year 2022 and increased 547 million or 34 percent as compared to fiscal year 2021 primarily due to battlefield 2042  the fifa franchise and f1 2021  partially offset by the star wars franchise and ufc 4  

mergers and acquisitions 

acquisition of glu mobile  on april 29 2021 we completed the acquisition of 100 of the equity interests of glu mobile inc a leading global developer and publisher of mobile games for a total purchase price of 20 billion net of cash acquired of 332 million the acquisition of glu is expected to accelerate our mobile growth by creating a combined organization with ongoing live services across multiple games and genres we also believe that the acquisition will create value by adding glu’s expertise in casual sports and lifestyle genres to new titles based on our intellectual property glu was integrated into the company for financial reporting purposes during the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2022 

acquisition of playdemic on september 20 2021 we completed the acquisition of 100 of the equity interests of playdemic limited a private limited company incorporated in england and wales for a total purchase price of 14 billion net of cash acquired the acquisition of playdemic is intended to be another step in our strategy of continued leadership in sports and mobile expansion playdemic was integrated into the company for financial reporting purposes during the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 

for more information about our acquisitions see part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in note 7 — business combinations  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities contingent assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the covid19 pandemic as a result actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

revenue recognition 

we derive revenue principally from sales of our games and related extra content and services that can be experienced on game consoles pcs mobile phones and tablets our product and service offerings include but are not limited to the following 

• full games with both online and offline functionality “games with services” which generally includes 1 the initial game delivered digitally or via physical disc at the time of sale and typically provide access to offline core game content “software license” 2 updates on a whenandifavailable basis such as software patches or updates andor additional free content to be delivered in the future “future update rights” and 3 a hosted connection for online playability “online hosting” 

• full games with onlineonly functionality which require an internet connection to access all gameplay and functionality “onlinehosted service games” 

• extra content related to games with services and onlinehosted service games which provides access to additional ingame content 

• subscriptions such as ea play and ea play pro that generally offer access to a selection of full games ingame content online services and other benefits typically for a recurring monthly or annual fee and 

• licensing to third parties to distribute and host our games and content 

we evaluate and recognize revenue by 

• identifying the contracts with the customer 

• identifying the performance obligations in the contract 

• determining the transaction price 

• allocating the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract and 

• recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied through the transfer of a promised good or service to a customer ie “transfer of control” 

certain of our full game andor extra content are sold to resellers with a contingency that the full game andor extra content cannot be resold prior to a specific date “street date contingency” we recognize revenue for transactions that have a street date contingency when the street date contingency is removed and the full game andor extra content can be resold by the reseller for digital full game andor extra content downloads sold to customers we recognize revenue when the full game andor extra content is made available for download to the customer 

onlineenabled games 

games with services our sales of games with services are evaluated to determine whether the software license future update rights and the online hosting are distinct and separable sales of games with services are generally determined to have three distinct performance obligations software license future update rights and the online hosting 

since we do not sell the performance obligations on a standalone basis we consider market conditions and other observable inputs to estimate the standalone selling price for each performance obligation for games with services generally 75 percent of the sales price is allocated to the software license performance obligation and recognized at a point in time when control of the license has been transferred to the customer the remaining 25 percent is allocated to the future update rights and the online hosting performance obligations and recognized ratably as the service is provided over the estimated offering period 

onlinehosted service games sales of our onlinehosted service games are determined to have one distinct performance obligation the online hosting we recognize revenue from these arrangements as the service is provided 

extra content revenue received from sales of downloadable content are derived primarily from the sale of virtual currencies and digital ingame content that are designed to extend and enhance players’ game experience sales of extra content are accounted for in a manner consistent with the treatment for our games with services and onlinehosted service games as discussed above depending upon whether or not the extra content has offline functionality that is if the extra content has offline functionality then the extra content is accounted for similarly to games with services generally determined to have three distinct performance obligations software license future update rights and the online hosting if the extra content does not have offline functionality then the extra content is determined to have one distinct performance obligation the onlinehosted service offering 

subscriptions 

sales of our subscriptions are deemed to be one performance obligation and we recognize revenue from these arrangements ratably over the subscription term as the performance obligation is satisfied 

licensing revenue 

we utilize thirdparty licensees to distribute and host our games and content in accordance with license agreements for which the licensees typically pay us a fixed minimum guarantee andor salesbased royalties these arrangements typically include multiple performance obligations such as a timebased license of software and future update rights we recognize as revenue a portion of the minimum guarantee when we transfer control of the license of software generally upon commercial launch and the remaining portion ratably over the contractual term in which we provide the licensee with future update rights any salesbased royalties are generally recognized as the related sales occur by the licensee 

significant judgments around revenue arrangements 

identifying performance obligations performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct ie the customer can benefit from the goods or services either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and are distinct in the context of the contract ie it is separately identifiable from other goods or services in the contract to the extent a contract includes multiple promises we must apply judgment to determine whether those promises are separate and distinct performance obligations if these criteria are not met the promises are accounted for as a combined performance obligation 

determining the transaction price the transaction price is determined based on the consideration that we will be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring our goods and services to the customer determining the transaction price often requires judgment based on an assessment of contractual terms and business practices it further includes review of variable consideration such as discounts sales returns price protection and rebates which is estimated at the time of the transaction in addition the transaction price does not include an estimate of the variable consideration related to salesbased royalties salesbased royalties are recognized as the sales occur 

allocating the transaction price allocating the transaction price requires that we determine an estimate of the relative standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation determining the relative standalone selling price is inherently subjective especially in situations where we do not sell the performance obligation on a standalone basis which occurs in the majority of our transactions in those situations we determine the relative standalone selling price based on various observable inputs using all information that is reasonably available examples of observable inputs and information include historical internal pricing data cost plus margin analysis prerelease versus postrelease costs and pricing data from competitors to the extent the data is available the results of our analysis resulted in a specific percentage of the transaction price being allocated to each performance obligation 

determining the estimated offering period the offering period is the period in which we offer to provide the future update rights andor online hosting for the game and related extra content sold because the offering period is not an explicitly defined period we must make an estimate of the offering period for the servicerelated performance obligations ie future update rights and online hosting determining the estimated offering period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision generally we consider the average period of time customers are online when estimating the offering period we also consider the estimated period of time between the date a game unit is sold to a reseller and the date the reseller sells the game unit to the customer ie time in channel based on these two factors we then consider the method of distribution for example games and extra content sold at retail would have a composite offering period equal to the online gameplay period plus time in channel as opposed to digitallydistributed games and extra content which are delivered immediately via digital download and therefore the offering period is estimated to be only the online gameplay period 

additionally we consider results from prior analyses known and expected online gameplay trends as well as disclosed service periods for competitors’ games in determining the estimated offering period for future sales we believe this provides a reasonable depiction of the transfer of future update rights and online hosting to our customers as it is the best representation of the time period during which our games and extra content are experienced we recognize revenue for future update rights and online hosting performance obligations ratably on a straightline basis over this period as there is a consistent pattern of delivery for these performance obligations prior to july 1 2020 these performance obligations were generally recognized over an estimated ninemonth period beginning in the month after shipment for games and extra content sold through retail and an estimated sixmonth period for digitallydistributed games and extra content beginning in the month of sale 

during the three months ended september 30 2020 we completed our annual evaluation of the estimated offering period and as a result for sales after july 1 2020 revenue for servicerelated performance obligations for games and extra content sold through retail are recognized over an estimated tenmonth period beginning in the month of sale and revenue for servicerelated performance obligations for digitallydistributed games and extra content is recognized over an estimated eightmonth period beginning in the month of sale the fiscal year 2021 change in estimated offering period did not impact the amount of net bookings or the operating cash flows that we report during the fiscal year ended march 31  2022  this change to our estimated offering period resulted in an increase in net revenue of  331 million and net income of  252 million and an increase of  088 diluted earnings per share during the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 this change to our estimated offering period resulted in a decrease in net revenue of  333 million and net income of  280 million and a decrease of  096 diluted earnings per share 

during the three months ended september 30 2021 we completed our annual evaluation of the estimated offering period we have noted consumers are playing certain of our online hosted service games such as pc and console freetoplay games for longer periods of time than in prior years as players engage with services we provide that are designed to enhance and extend gameplay and as such have concluded that the estimated offering period for such games should be lengthened as a result for all new sales after july 1 2021 the revenue that we recognize for servicerelated performance obligations related to our pc and console freetoplay games is recognized generally over a twelvemonth period this change in estimated offering period did not impact the amount of net bookings or the operating cash flows that we report during the fiscal year ended march 31  2022  this change to our estimated offering period resulted in a decrease in net revenue of  131 million and net income of  100 million and a decrease of  035 diluted earnings per share 

principal agent considerations 

we evaluate sales to end customers of our full games and related content via thirdparty storefronts including digital storefronts such as microsoft’s xbox store sony’s playstation store apple app store and google play store in order to determine whether or not we are acting as the principal in the sale to the end customer which we consider in determining if revenue should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the thirdparty storefront an entity is the principal if it controls a good or service before it is transferred to the end customer key indicators that we evaluate in determining gross versus net treatment include but are not limited to the following 

• the underlying contract terms and conditions between the various parties to the transaction 

• which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service to the end customer 

• which party has inventory risk before the specified good or service has been transferred to the end customer and 

• which party has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service 

based on an evaluation of the above indicators except as discussed below we have determined that generally the third party is considered the principal to end customers for the sale of our full games and related content we therefore report revenue related to these arrangements net of the fees retained by the storefront however for sales arrangements via apple app store and google play store ea is considered the principal to the end customer and thus we report revenue on a gross basis and mobile platform fees are reported within cost of revenue 

fair value estimates 

business combinations we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and acquired inprocess technology in a business combination our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various estimated useful lives furthermore the estimated fair value assigned to an acquired asset or liability has a direct impact on the amount we recognize as goodwill which is an asset that is not amortized accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets 

although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable they are based in part on historical experience market conditions and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain and unpredictable examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets and in determining the useful lives for the assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to 

• future expected revenues and cash flows 

• expected use of the acquired assets 

• the acquired company’s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in our portfolio 

• expected costs to develop inprocess research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed 

• discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated future cash flows which are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks 

such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both 1 the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and 2 the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carryforwards we do not recognize any deferred taxes related to the us taxes on foreign earnings as we recognize these taxes as a period cost 

we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified it is generally difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is significant negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years forecasts of future taxable income are considered to be less objective than past results therefore cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 

in addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities the carryback of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law and the implementation of tax planning 

strategies evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence and this evaluation may involve assumptions about future activity certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets 

every quarter we perform a realizability analysis to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized our swiss deferred tax asset realizability analysis relies upon future swiss taxable income as the primary source of taxable income but considers all available sources of swiss income based on the positive and negative evidence we give more weight to evidence that can be objectively verified however there is judgment involved in estimating future swiss taxable income specifically related to assumptions about expected growth rates of future swiss taxable income which are based primarily on third party market and industry growth data actual results that differ materially from those estimates could have a material impact on our valuation allowance assessment although objectively verifiable swiss interest rates have an impact on the valuation allowance and are based on published swiss guidance any significant changes to such interest rates could result in a material impact to the valuation allowance switzerland has a sevenyear carryforward period and does not permit the carry back of losses changes in estimated offering period and actions we take in connection with acquisitions could also impact the utilization of our swiss deferred tax asset 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate these estimates require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation as well as with respect to other matters such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities the ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations in addition changes in our business including acquisitions changes in our international corporate structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix and amount of income as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities valuation allowances applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective tax rate

net revenue 

net revenue consists of sales generated from 1 full games sold as digital downloads or as packaged goods and designed for play on game consoles pcs and mobile phones and tablets 2 live services associated with these games such as extracontent 3 subscriptions that generally offer access to a selection of full games ingame content online services and other benefits and 4 licensing our games to third parties to distribute and host our games 

comparison of fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2021 

net revenue 

net revenue for fiscal year 2022 was  6991 million primarily driven by sales related to our fifa and madden franchises apex legends and the sims 4  net revenue for fiscal year 2022 increased 1362 million as compared to fiscal year 2021 this increase was driven by a 1839 million increase in net revenue primarily driven by increased yearoveryear sales for the fifa franchise and apex legends  new games added to our portfolio through acquisitions activity including f1 2021 and several mobile titles and battlefield 2042  this increase was partially offset by a 477 million decrease in net revenue primarily from the star wars the sims need for speed and ufc franchises 

net revenue by composition 

as our business has evolved and management focuses less on the differentiation between our packaged goods business and our digital business and more on our full game sales and live services that extend and enhance gameplay we present net revenue by composition to align with this management view 

our net revenue by composition for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 was as follows in millions

during the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 we completed intraentity sales of intellectual property rights related to recent acquisitions to our us and swiss intellectual property owners the “acquired ip intraentity sales” the transactions resulted in overall taxable gains under us gaap any profit resulting from the acquired ip intraentity sales was eliminated upon 

consolidation however the transactions resulted in a stepup of the us and swiss taxdeductible basis in the transferred intellectual property rights and accordingly created a temporary difference between the book basis and the tax basis of such intellectual property rights as a result we recognized a 64 million net tax benefit for the current and deferred tax impacts of the sales 

in addition during the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 we recognized a 29 million tax charge to increase the valuation allowance on swiss deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized the acquired ip intraentity sales and the change in valuation allowance had the effect of reducing our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 by 32 percentage points

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market prices which have experienced significant volatility market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below while we do not hedge our shortterm investment portfolio we protect our shortterm investment portfolio against different market risks including interest rate risk as discussed below our cash and cash equivalents portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for speculative trading purposes and do not hedge our market price risk relating to marketable equity securities if any 

foreign currency exchange risk 

foreign currency exchange rates international sales are a fundamental part of our business and the strengthening of the us dollar particularly relative to the euro british pound sterling australian dollar japanese yen chinese yuan south korean won and polish zloty has a negative impact on our reported international net revenue but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses particularly the swedish krona and the canadian dollar because these amounts are translated at lower rates as compared to periods in which the us dollar is weaker while we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risk these activities are limited in the protection that they provide us and can themselves result in losses 

cash flow hedging activities we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreign currencydenominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing foreign currency forward contracts that generally have maturities of 18 months or less these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements in net revenue and research and development expenses 

balance sheet hedging activities  we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk associated with foreign currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily intercompany receivables and payables these foreign currency forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three months or less and are transacted near monthend 

we believe the counterparties to our foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations as of march 31 2022 a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 20 percent would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value on our foreign currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging of 215 million or 430 million respectively as of march 31 2022 a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 20 percent would have resulted in potential losses in the consolidated statements of operations on our foreign currency forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of 90 million or 181 million respectively this sensitivity analysis assumes an adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates however all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in the same manner and actual results may differ materially see note 5 — derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as it relates to our derivative financial instruments which is incorporated by reference into this item 7a 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities however because shortterm investments mature relatively quickly and if reinvested are invested at the thencurrent market rates interest income on a portfolio consisting of shortterm investments is subject to market fluctuations to a greater extent than a portfolio of longer term investments additionally the contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to call prepay or otherwise settle the investments at prices less than the stated par value our investments are held for purposes other than trading we do not use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio 

as of march 31 2022 our shortterm investments were classified as availableforsale securities and consequently were recorded at fair value with changes in fair value including unrealized gains and unrealized losses not related to credit losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax in stockholders’ equity 

notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our shortterm investment portfolio to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our shortterm investment portfolio we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the portfolio assuming a 150 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve as of march 31 2022 a hypothetical 150 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a 3 million or 1 decrease in the fair market value of our shortterm investments

competition 

the market for interactive entertainment is intensely competitive and changes rapidly as new products business models and distribution channels are introduced we also face competition for the right to use certain intellectual property included in our products in order to remain successful we are required to anticipate sometimes years in advance the ways in which our products and services will compete in the market we face significant competition from companies such as activision blizzard taketwo interactive ubisoft epic games tencent zynga netmarble warner brothers sony microsoft and nintendo primarily with respect to developing games and services that operate on consoles pcs andor mobile devices in addition the gaming technologyinternet and entertainment industries have converged in recent years and larger wellfunded technology companies such as alphabet amazon apple facebook and microsoft are pursuing and strengthening their interactive entertainment capabilities and new entrants continue to emerge 

more broadly we compete against providers of different sources of entertainment such as movies television social networking online casual entertainment and music that our players could enjoy in their free time important competitive factors in our industry include the ability to attract creative and technical talent game quality and ease of use innovation compatibility of products with certain consoles and other distribution channels brand recognition reputation reliability security creativity price marketing and quality of customer service 

intellectual property and technology 

to establish and protect our intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyrights trademarks patents patent applications trade secrets knowhow license agreements confidentiality provisions and procedures and other contractual provisions we actively engage in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property but the laws of some countries in which we operate particularly in asia either do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the united states or are poorly enforced as our digital business has grown our games and services increasingly depend on the reliability availability and security of our technological infrastructure our industry is prone to and our systems and networks are subject to actions by malfeasant actors such as cyberattacks and other information security incidents while we devote financial and operational resources to implement systems processes and technologies to guard against cyber events and to help protect our intellectual property employee and consumer data and information technology systems against intrusions or other security breaches we have experienced such events in the past and expect future events to occur in addition we engage in activities designed to limit the impact of abuse of our digital products and services including monitoring our games for evidence of exploitation and rebalancing our game environments in the event that such abuse is discovered 

governmental regulation 

we are a global company subject to various and complex laws and regulations domestically and internationally including laws and regulations related to user privacy data collection and retention consumer protection protection of minors content including usergenerated content advertising localization information security intellectual property competition and taxation among others many of these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing and the application to and impact on us is uncertain certain of our business models are subject to new laws or regulations or evolving interpretations and application of existing laws and regulations including those related to gambling the growth and development of electronic commerce virtual items and virtual currency has prompted calls for new laws and regulations and resulted in the application of existing laws or regulations that have limited or restricted the sale of our products and services in certain territories 

seasonality 

we have historically experienced the highest percentage of our net bookings in our third fiscal quarter due to seasonal holiday demand and the launch timing of our games while we expect this trend to continue in fiscal year 2022 there is no assurance that it will 

human capital 

a healthy culture and engaged workforce is essential to our ability to execute our strategic pillars and build ongoing and meaningful relationships with our communities as a knowledgebased business our ability to attract train motivate and retain qualified employees is a critical factor in the successful development of our products and services and that our future success will depend in large measure on our ability to continue attracting training motivating and retaining qualified employees as of march 31 2021 we employed approximately 11000 people globally with 64 percent located internationally 

we are focused on supporting our employees across the full employee lifecycle and have implemented programs and practices designed to promote inclusion and diversity employee engagement and employee wellness for example we support seven employee resource groups “ergs” which are a critical component of our culture and provide allyship across groups and functions within the company our ergs connect employees create a sense of belonging and contribute directly to our inclusion and diversity pillars our largest erg women’s ultimate team has approximately 1500 members in addition to support our employees during the covid19 pandemic during fiscal year 2021 we enhanced our programs to provide additional temporary support including payments to assist with work from home costs and care needs a pandemic care leave program and additional services for mental and physical health 

inclusion and diversity 

inclusion and diversity is a business imperative because our global player community crosses lines of gender race ethnicity and geography to create games and experiences that resonate with players we need to cultivate a workforce that reflects this diverse player community we work to embed inclusion across our systems and processes in order to 1 develop relatable content and games 2 enable expansion into new and diverse markets 3 attract develop and retain talent that can thrive and do their best work and 4 bridge to better representation that authentically reflects our players 

in fiscal year 2021 we published our companywide gender and racialethnic representation for the first time which will allow our communities and stakeholders to measure our progress to accelerate this progress with respect to representation we strive to 1 create an inclusive culture that welcomes different viewpoints and enables employees to do the best work of their careers 2 equip our leaders with training and education that increases understanding and provides them with the tools and behaviors to be inclusive managers that advocate for equity inclusion and diversity and 3 evaluate people processes with an eye to systemic inclusion and execution of inclusive behaviors and practices 

our commitments to inclusion diversity and equity extend to compensating our employees fairly based on the work that they perform we consider our pay equity philosophy at each stage at which compensation decisions are made including when hiring and promoting employees and through our annual review cycle in addition we annually partner with an independent outside firm to review employees’ pay and ensure our compensation philosophy and practices are fair and free from unconscious bias resulting in equitable pay 

talent acquisition development and retention 

our talent planning and hiring strategies are aligned with our strategic vision and where we need to invest and develop as a business we target talent that possess skills that are critical to the future of our business including investing in the development and growth of the next generation of diverse talent through community outreach and steam education 

we are focused on promoting the total wellness of our people and maintain resources programs and services to support employees physical mental familial and financial health we offer a wide range of benefits such as comprehensive health insurance and timeoff and leave programs including specialized programs around key life events in response to the covid19 pandemic we introduced temporary expansions of our benefits programs that we determined were in the best interests of our employees and our communities these include payments to assist with work from home costs and care needs and a pandemic care leave program 

all regular fulltime employees are asked to complete an engagement survey twice per year which helps ea understand how to improve the employee experience we also conduct regular manager surveys and during fiscal year 2021 offered ongoing access to targeted surveys to better understand the needs of our employees as they navigated the covid19 pandemic results of all employee surveys are evaluated and shared across the organization and inform opportunities for further improvement in our people practices

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance in the past we have experienced certain of the events and circumstances described below which adversely impacted our business and financial performance if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs our business or financial performance could be harmed our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe could be material that may harm our business or financial performance 

strategic risks 

our business is intensely competitive we may not deliver successful and engaging products and services or consumers may prefer our competitors’ products or services over our own 

competition in our business is intense many new products and services are regularly introduced but only a relatively small number of products and associated services drive significant engagement and account for a significant portion of total revenue our competitors range from established interactive entertainment companies to emerging startups in addition the gaming technologyinternet and entertainment industries have converged in recent years and larger wellfunded technology companies are pursuing and strengthening their interactive entertainment capabilities we expect new competitors to continue to emerge throughout the world if our competitors develop more successful and engaging products or services offer competitive products or services at lower price points or if we do not continue to develop consistently highquality wellreceived and engaging products and services or if our marketing strategies are not innovative or fail to resonate with players particularly during key selling periods our revenue margins and profitability will decline 

we strive to create innovative and highquality products and services that allow us to build ongoing and meaningful relationships with our community however innovative and highquality titles even if highlyreviewed may not meet our expectations or the expectations of our players many financially successful products and services within our industry are iterations of prior titles with large established consumer bases and significant brand recognition which makes competing in certain categories challenging in addition products or services of our direct competitors or other entertainment companies may take a larger portion of consumer spending or time than we anticipate which could cause our products and services to underperform relative to our expectations a significant portion of our revenue historically has been derived from products and services based on a few popular franchises and the underperformance of a single major title has had and could in the future have a material adverse impact on our financial results for example we have historically derived a significant portion of our net revenue from sales related to our largest and most popular game fifa annualized versions of which are consistently one of the bestselling games in the marketplace any events or circumstances that negatively impact our fifa franchise such as product or service quality other products that take a portion of consumer spending and time the delay or cancellation of a product or service launch increased competition for key licenses or real or perceived security risks could negatively impact our financial results to a disproportionate extent 

the increased importance of live services including extra content to our business heightens the risks associated with the products for which such live services are offered live services that are either poorlyreceived or provided in connection with underperforming games may generate lower than expected sales any lapse delay or failure in our ability to provide highquality live services content to consumers over an extended period of time could materially and adversely affect our financial results consumer engagement with our live services and cause harm to our reputation and brand our most popular live service is the extra content available for the ultimate team mode associated with our sports franchises any events or circumstances that negatively impact our ability to reliably provide content or sustain engagement for ultimate team particularly fifa ultimate team would negatively impact our financial results to a disproportionate extent 

we may not meet our product and live service development schedules and key events sports seasons andor movies that are tied to our product and live service release schedule may be delayed cancelled or poorly received 

our ability to meet product and live service development schedules is affected by a number of factors both within and outside our control including feedback from our players the creative processes involved the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams the complexity of our products and the platforms for which they are developed the need to finetune our products prior to their release and in certain cases approvals from third parties we have experienced development delays for our products and services in the past which caused us to delay or cancel release dates any failure to meet anticipated production or release schedules likely would result in a delay of revenue andor possibly a significant shortfall in our revenue increase our development andor marketing expenses harm our profitability and cause our operating results to 

be materially different than anticipated if we miss key selling periods for products or services particularly the fiscal quarter ending in december for any reason including product delays or product cancellations our sales likely will suffer significantly 

we also seek to release certain products and extra content for our live services  such as our sports franchises and the associated ultimate team live service  in conjunction with key events such as the beginning of a sports season events associated with the sports calendar or the release of a related movie if such seasons or events were delayed cancelled or poorly received our sales could suffer materially for example the covid19 pandemic has resulted in the disruption postponement and cancellation of sports seasons and sporting events further disruption postponement and cancellation of sports seasons and sporting events around which we seek to launch our games and provide live services could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

our industry changes rapidly and we may fail to anticipate or successfully implement new or evolving technologies or adopt successful business strategies distribution methods or services 

rapid changes in our industry require us to anticipate sometimes years in advance the ways in which our products and services will be competitive in the market we have invested and in the future may invest in new business and marketing strategies technologies distribution methods products and services there can be no assurance that these strategic investments will achieve expected returns for example we are investing in our mobile business through seeking to maximize our mobile live services meaningfully expanding key franchises on the mobile platform and through mergers and acquisitions activity in addition we are investing in a technological infrastructure that we expect will enable us to deliver content that will resonate with players and provide more choice in the way that players connect with their games with each other and with new types of content such endeavors involve significant risks and uncertainties no assurance can be given that the technology we choose to implement the business and marketing strategies we choose to adopt and the products services and platform strategies that we pursue will achieve financial results that meet or exceed our expectations our reputation and brand could also be adversely affected we also may miss opportunities or fail to respond quickly enough to adopt technology or distribution methods or develop products services or new ways to engage with our games that become popular with consumers which could adversely affect our financial results 

our development process usually starts with particular platforms and distribution methods in mind and a range of technical development feature and ongoing goals that we hope to be able to achieve we may not be able to achieve these goals or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly and in a way that better engages consumers in either case our products and services may be technologically inferior to those of our competitors less appealing to consumers or both if we cannot achieve our goals within the original development schedule for our products and services then we may delay their release until these goals can be achieved which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses alternatively we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies either to preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up with our competition which would increase our development expenses 

negative perceptions about our business products and services and the communities within our products and services may damage our business and we may incur costs to address concerns 

expectations regarding the quality performance and integrity of our products and services are high players have sometimes been critical of our brands products services online communities business models andor business practices for a wide variety of reasons including perceptions about gameplay fun fairness game content features or services or objections to certain of our business practices these negative responses may not be foreseeable we also may not effectively manage these responses because of reasons within or outside of our control for example we have included in certain games the ability for players to purchase digital items including in some instances virtual “packs” “boxes” or “crates” that contain variable digital items the inclusion of variable digital items in certain games has attracted the attention of our community and if the future implementation of these features creates a negative perception of gameplay fairness or other negative perceptions our reputation and brand could be harmed and revenue could be negatively impacted in addition we have taken actions including delaying the release of our games and delaying or discontinuing features and services for our games after taking into consideration among other things feedback from our community even if those decisions negatively impacted our operating results in the short term we expect to continue to take actions to address concerns as appropriate including actions that may result in additional expenditures and the loss of revenue 

we aim to offer our players safe fun and inclusive environments in which to play provide players with information about their engagement and tools that allow them control of their experiences and deploy tools and technologies to give players faith in their gameplay experience although we expend resources and expect to continue to expend resources to promote positive play our efforts may not be successful due to scale limitations of existing technologies or other factors if our efforts are 

unsuccessful our brand and reputation may be harmed and our financial and operating results may be adversely impacted negative sentiment about gameplay fairness our online communities our business practices business models or game content also can lead to investigations or increased scrutiny from governmental bodies and consumer groups as well as litigation which regardless of their outcome may be costly damaging to our reputation and harm our business 

certain of our games and features on our platforms support online features that allow players and viewers to communicate with one another and post content in real time that is visible to other players and viewers from time to time this “user generated content” may contain objectionable and offensive content that is distributed and disseminated by third parties and our brands may be negatively affected by such actions if we fail to appropriately respond to the dissemination of such content we may be subject to lawsuits and governmental regulation our players may not engage with our products and services andor may lose confidence in our brands and our financial results may be adversely affected 

external game developers may not meet product development schedules or otherwise honor their obligations 

we contract with external game developers to develop our games or to publish or distribute their games while we maintain contractual protections we have less control over the product development schedules of games developed by external developers we depend on their ability to meet product development schedules which could be negatively affected by among other things the distributed workforce model resulting from the covid19 pandemic in addition disputes occasionally arise with external developers including with respect to game content launch timing achievement of certain milestones the game development timeline marketing campaigns contractual terms and interpretation if we have disputes with external developers or they cannot meet product development schedules acquire certain approvals or are otherwise unable or unwilling to honor their obligations to us we may delay or cancel previously announced games alter our launch schedule or experience increased costs and expenses which could result in a delay or significant shortfall in anticipated revenue harm our profitability and reputation and cause our financial results to be materially affected 

our business depends on the success and availability of consoles systems and devices developed by third parties and our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for those consoles systems and devices 

the success of our business is driven in part by the commercial success and adequate supply of thirdparty consoles systems and devices for which we develop our products and services or through which our products and services are distributed our success depends on our ability to connect more players across more platforms and more ways to play by accurately predicting which consoles systems and devices will be successful in the marketplace our ability to develop commercially successful products and services that reach players across multiple channels our ability to simultaneously manage products and services on multiple consoles systems and devices and our ability to effectively transition our products and services to new consoles systems and devices we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of the commercial availability of new consoles systems and devices and we may incur significant expense to adjust our product portfolio and development efforts in response to changing consumer preferences additionally we may enter into certain exclusive licensing arrangements that affect our ability to deliver or market products or services on certain consoles systems or devices a console system or device for which we are developing products and services may not succeed as expected or new consoles systems or devices may take market share and interactive entertainment consumers away from those for which we have devoted significant resources if consumer demand for the consoles systems or devices for which we are developing products and services is lower than our expectations we may be unable to fully recover the investments we have made in developing our products and services and our financial performance will be harmed alternatively a console system or device for which we have not devoted significant resources could be more successful than we initially anticipated causing us to not be able to reach our intended audience and take advantage of meaningful revenue opportunities 

in fiscal year 2021 our key console partners sony and microsoft each released new generation consoles in periods of transition sales of products for legacy generation consoles typically slow or decline in response to the introduction of new consoles and sales of products for new generation consoles typically stabilize only after new consoles are widelyestablished with the consumer base this console transition may have a comparable impact on our live services business potentially increasing the impact on our financial results the transition could accelerate faster than anticipated and may put downward pressure on legacy generation pricing which could negatively affect our operating results our revenue from sales for the new generation consoles from sony and microsoft may not offset the negative effects of the transition on our operating results alternatively adoption of the new generation consoles in which we have made significant investments may be slower than we anticipate or wide consumer availability may be delayed we do not control the unit volumes of consoles made available for sale the pricing or appeal of new generation consoles or the rates at which consumers purchase these consoles for a period of time we will also develop market and operate games and services on both legacy and new generation consoles simultaneously as a result of these factors our operating results during this transition may be more volatile and difficult to predict 

we may experience declines or fluctuations in the recurring portion of our business 

our business model includes revenue that we deem recurring in nature such as revenue from our annualized sports franchises eg fifa madden nfl our console pc and mobile catalog titles ie titles that did not launch in the current fiscal year and our live services while we have been able to forecast the revenue from these areas of our business with greater relative confidence than for new games services and business models we cannot provide assurances that consumer demand will remain consistent including in connection with circumstances outside of our control furthermore we may cease to offer games and services that we previously had deemed to be recurring in nature consumer demand has declined and fluctuated and could in the future decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their level of satisfaction with our games and services our ability to improve and innovate our annualized titles our ability to adapt our games and services to new distribution channels and business models outages and disruptions of online services the games and services offered by our competitors our marketing and advertising efforts or declines in consumer activity generally as a result of economic downturns among others the reception to our sports games also depends in part on the popularity reputation and brand of the leagues organizations and individual athletes with whom we partner events and circumstances outside of our control that have a negative impact on the accessibility popularity reputation and brand of these partners has impacted and could in the future negatively impact sales related to our annualized sports games any decline or fluctuation in the recurring portion of our business may have a negative impact on our financial and operating results 

we could fail to successfully adopt new business models 

from time to time we seek to establish and implement new business models forecasting the success of any new business model is inherently uncertain and depends on a number of factors both within and outside of our control our actual revenue and profit for these businesses may be significantly greater or less than our forecasts in addition these new business models could fail resulting in the loss of our investment in the development and infrastructure needed to support these new business models as well as the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from more successful and established businesses for example we have devoted financial and operational resources to our subscription offerings without any assurance that these businesses will be financially successful while we anticipate growth in this area of our business consumer demand is difficult to predict as a result of a number of factors including satisfaction with our products and services our ability to provide engaging products and services third parties offering their products and services within our subscription partners that provide or don’t provide access to our subscription products and services offered by our competitors reliability of our infrastructure and the infrastructure of our partners pricing the actual or perceived security of our and our partners information technology systems and reductions in consumer spending levels in addition if our subscription offerings are successful sales could be diverted from established business models if we do not select a target price that is optimal for our subscription services maintain our target pricing structure or correctly project renewal rates our financial results may be harmed 

acquisitions investments divestitures and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and other negative consequences 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions including 1 acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets 2 minority investments in strategic partners and 3 investments in new interactive entertainment businesses as part of our longterm business strategy for example in february 2021 we acquired codemasters and in april 2021 we acquired glu the codemasters acquisition the glu acquisition and other transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment or cannot realize anticipated tax benefits that we acquire liabilities andor litigation from acquired companies or liabilities andor litigation results from the transactions that our due diligence process does not identify significant issues liabilities or other challenges diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses and the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses in addition we may not integrate these businesses successfully or achieve expected synergies for example we may experience difficulties and costs associated with the integration of business systems and technologies and acquired products and services the integration and retention of new employees the implementation of our internal control and compliance procedures andor the remediation of the internal control and compliance environment of the acquired entity or the maintenance of key business and customer relationships these events could harm our operating results or financial condition 

we may fund strategic transactions with 1 cash which would reduce cash available for other corporate purposes 2 debt which would increase our interest expense and leverage andor 3 equity which would dilute current shareholders’ percentage ownership and also dilute our earnings per share we also may divest or sell assets or a business and we may have difficulty selling such assets or business on acceptable terms in a timely manner this could result in a delay in the achievement of our 

strategic objectives cause us to incur additional expense or the sale of such assets or business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we anticipated 

we may be unable to maintain or acquire licenses to include intellectual property owned by others in our games or to maintain or acquire the rights to publish or distribute games developed by others 

many of our products and services are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our ea sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues teams and players’ associations and our star wars products include rights licensed from disney competition for these licenses and rights is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses and rights or obtain additional licenses or rights with significant commercial value our ability to develop successful and engaging products and services may be adversely affected and our revenue profitability and cash flows may decline significantly competition for these licenses has increased and may continue to increase the amounts that we must pay to licensors and developers through higher minimum guarantees or royalty rates which could significantly increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

our business partners may be unable to honor their obligations to us or their actions may put us at risk 

we rely on various business partners including thirdparty service providers vendors licensing partners development partners and licensees their actions may put our business and our reputation and brand at risk for example we may have disputes with our business partners that may impact our business andor financial results in many cases our business partners may be given access to sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support and they may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it in addition the failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies or the failure of the third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies could result in a disruption to our business operations further disruptions in the financial markets economic downturns poor business decisions or reputational harm may adversely affect our business partners and they may not be able to continue honoring their obligations to us or we may cease our arrangements with them alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner or vendor if we lose one or more significant business partners our business could be harmed and our financial results could be materially affected 

a significant portion of our packaged goods sales are made to a relatively small number of retail and distribution partners and these sales may be disrupted 

we derive a significant percentage of our net revenue attributable to sales of our packaged goods products to our top retail and distribution partners the concentration of a significant percentage of these sales through a few large partners could lead to a shortterm disruption to our business if certain of these partners significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to offer our products the financial position of certain partners has deteriorated and while we maintain protections such as monitoring the credit extended to these partners we could be vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these partners experienced continued deterioration of their business or declared bankruptcy the covid19 pandemic has resulted in closures of the retail stores of certain partners which could negatively impact the sales of our packaged goods products and accelerate deterioration of the financial position of such partners additionally receivables from these partners generally increase in our december fiscal quarter as sales of our products generally increase in anticipation of the holiday season which expose us to heightened risk at that time of year having a significant portion of our packaged goods sales concentrated in a few partners could reduce our negotiating leverage with them if one or more of these partners experience deterioration in their business or become unable to obtain sufficient financing to maintain their operations our business could be harmed 

operational risks 

the covid19 pandemic has affected how we are operating our business and the full extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business and financial results is uncertain 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic and related public health measures federal state local and foreign governmental authorities have imposed and continue to impose protocols and restrictions intended to contain the spread of the virus including limitations on the size of gatherings mandated closure of work facilities schools and businesses quarantines lockdowns and travel restrictions in addition we have established and will continue to maintain protocols to promote the health and safety of our workforce and business partners substantially all of our office locations including our global headquarters in redwood shores california and key studios across north america europe and asia remain closed to the majority of our employees with onsite access limited to those with a critical need 

the global workfromhome operating environment has caused strain and fatigue to our global workforce in addition certain of our development teams currently work in a distributed environment whereas these teams historically collaborated inperson on the creative and technical process required to develop highquality products and services at scale each of these factors has disrupted and may continue to disrupt the productivity of our workforce and the creative process to which our teams are accustomed companies in our industry have experienced issues related to game and service quality during the current workfromhome period while we were able to execute against our product and service launch schedules with minimal impact and deliver quality games and services at scale during fiscal year 2021 the longerterm impact to our creative and technical development processes is unknown and the associated risks including with respect to game quality and developmental delays which may cause us to delay or cancel release dates may be heightened as the workfromhome period persists 

we are actively planning so that we are ready to reopen locations when it is appropriate to do so consistent with the health and safety of our employees and in compliance with any local legal restrictions or requirements the reintroduction of employees to the workplace could introduce operational risk negatively impact productivity and give rise to claims by employees or otherwise adversely affect our business in addition the longterm effects of the covid19 pandemic on the nature of the office environment and remote working are not certain and may present operational challenges and impact our ability to attract and retain talent and our teams’ ability to collaborate creatively each of which may adversely affect our business 

during the covid19 pandemic we have seen increased demand for our products and services and changing player behavior with more people staying at home our financial results and operating metrics benefited during fiscal year 2021 from these factors in addition longerterm trends that benefit our business accelerated including a significant increase in live services revenue and the proportion of our games purchased digitally these trends from fiscal year 2021 may not be indicative of results for future periods particularly as factors related to the covid19 pandemic lessen and consumers can engage with other forms of entertainment if the trend towards digital adoption decelerates or if global macroeconomic effects related to the covid19 pandemic persist even after the pandemic has subsided 

the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time such as the duration and spread of the pandemic the extent speed and effectiveness of worldwide containment and vaccination efforts and the impact of these and other factors on our employees customers partners and vendors if we are not able to flexibly respond to and manage the impact of these and other currently unknown impacts related to the covid19 pandemic our business will be harmed 

to the extent that the covid19 pandemic harms our business and results of operations many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section may be heightened 

catastrophic events may disrupt our business 

natural disasters cyberincidents weather events wildfires power disruptions telecommunications failures pandemics health crises and other public health events failed upgrades of existing systems or migrations to new systems acts of terrorism or other events could cause outages disruptions andor degradations of our infrastructure including our or our partners’ information technology and network systems a failure in our ability to conduct normal business operations or the closure of public spaces in which players engage with our games and services the health and safety of our employees players thirdparty organizations with whom we partner or regulatory agencies on which we rely could be also affected any of which may prevent us from executing against our business strategies andor cause a decrease in consumer demand for our products and services 

system redundancy may be ineffective and our disaster recovery and business continuity planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures disruptions closures or inability to conduct normal business operations could also prevent access to our products services or online stores selling our products and services cause delay or interruption in our product or live services offerings allow breaches of data security or result in the loss of critical data our corporate headquarters and several of our key studios also are located in seismically active regions an event that results in the disruption or degradation of any of our critical business functions or information technology systems harms our ability to conduct normal business operations or causes a decrease in consumer demand for our products and services could materially impact our reputation and brand financial condition and operating results 

we may experience security breaches and cyber threats 

the integrity of our and our partners’ information technology networks and systems is critical to our ongoing operations products and services our industry is prone to and our systems and networks are subject to actions by malfeasant actors such as cyberattacks and other information security incidents that seek to exploit disable damage andor disrupt our networks business operations products and services and supporting technological infrastructure or gain access to consumer and 

employee personal information our intellectual property and other assets in addition our systems and networks could be harmed or improperly accessed due to error by employees or third parties that are authorized to access to these networks and systems we also rely on technological infrastructure provided by thirdparty business partners to support the online functionality of our products and services who are also subject to these same cyber risks both our partners and we have expended and expect to continue to expend financial and operational resources to guard against cyber risks and to help protect our data and systems however the techniques used by malfeasant actors change frequently continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and often are not detected for long periods of time as a result of the covid19 pandemic remote access to our networks and systems and the networks and systems of our partners has increased substantially while we and our partners have taken steps to secure our networks and systems these networks and systems may be more vulnerable to a successful cyberattack or information security incident while workforces remains distributed the costs to respond to mitigate andor notify affected parties of cyberattacks and other security vulnerabilities are significant in addition such events could compromise the confidentiality integrity or accessibility of these networks and systems or result in the compromise or loss of the data including personal data processed by these systems consequences of such events have included and could in the future include the loss of proprietary and personal data and interruptions or delays in our business operations as well as loss of player confidence and damage to our brand and reputation in addition such events could cause us to be noncompliant with applicable regulations and subject us to legal claims or penalties under laws protecting the privacy or security of personal information or proprietary material information we have experienced such events in the past and expect future events to occur 

in addition the virtual economies that we have established in many of our games are subject to abuse exploitation and other forms of fraudulent activity that can negatively impact our business virtual economies involve the use of virtual currency andor virtual assets that can be used or redeemed by a player within a particular game or service the abuse or exploitation of our virtual economies have included the illegitimate or unauthorized generation and sale of virtual items including in black markets our online services have been impacted by ingame exploits and the use of automated or other fraudulent processes to generate virtual item or currency illegitimately and such activity may continue these abuses and exploits and the steps that we take to address these abuses and exploits may result in a loss of anticipated revenue increased costs to protect against or remediate these issues interfere with players’ enjoyment of a balanced game environment and cause harm to our reputation and brand 

we may experience outages disruptions or degradations in our services products andor technological infrastructure 

the reliable performance of our products and services depends on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology systems and those of our external service providers including thirdparty “cloud” computing services our games and services are complex software products and maintaining the sophisticated internal and external technological infrastructure required to reliably deliver these games and services is expensive and complex the reliable delivery and stability of our products and services has been and could in the future be adversely impacted by outages disruptions failures or degradations in our network and related infrastructure as well as in the online platforms or services of key business partners that offer support or host our products and services the reliability and stability of our products and services has been affected by events outside of our control as well as by events within our control such as the migration of data among data centers and to thirdparty hosted environments the performance of upgrades and maintenance on our systems and online demand for our products and services that exceeds the capabilities of our technological infrastructure 

if we or our external business partners were to experience an event that caused a significant system outage disruption or degradation or if a transition among data centers or service providers or an upgrade or maintenance session encountered unexpected interruptions unforeseen complexity or unplanned disruptions our products and services may not be available to consumers or may not be delivered reliably and stably as a result our reputation and brand may be harmed consumer engagement with our products and services may be reduced and our revenue and profitability could be negatively impacted we do not have redundancy for all our systems many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities 

as our digital business grows we will require an increasing amount of internal and external technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy the needs of our players we are investing and expect to continue to invest in our own technology hardware and software and the technology hardware and software of external service providers to support our business it is possible that we may fail to scale effectively and grow this technical infrastructure to accommodate increased demands which may adversely affect the reliable and stable performance of our games and services therefore negatively impacting engagement reputation brand and revenue growth 

we may not attract train motivate and retain key personnel 

our business depends on our ability to attract train motivate and retain executive technical creative marketing and other personnel that are essential to the development marketing and support of our products and services the market for highlyskilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive particularly in the geographic locations in which many of our key personnel are located in addition our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting our executives as well as key creative and technical talent we may experience significant compensation costs to hire and retain senior executives and other personnel that we deem critical to our success if we cannot successfully recruit train motivate and retain qualified employees develop and maintain a diverse and inclusive work environment or replace key employees following their departure our ability to develop and manage our business will be impaired 

we rely on the consoles systems and devices of partners who have significant influence over the products and services that we offer in the marketplace 

a significant percentage of our digital net revenue is attributable to sales of products and services through our significant partners including sony microsoft apple and google the concentration of a material portion of our digital sales in these partners exposes us to risks associated with these businesses any deterioration in the businesses of our significant partners could disrupt and harm our business including by limiting the methods through which our digital products and services are offered and exposing us to collection risks 

in addition our license agreements typically provide these partners with significant control over the approval and distribution of the products and services that we develop for their consoles systems and devices for products and services delivered via digital channels each respective partner has policies and guidelines that control the promotion and distribution of these titles and the features and functionalities that we are permitted to offer through the channel in addition we are dependent on these partners to invest in and upgrade the capabilities of their systems in a manner than corresponds to the preferences of consumers failure by these partners to keep pace with consumer preferences could have an adverse impact on the engagement with our products and services and our ability to merchandise and commercialize our products and services which could harm our business andor financial results 

moreover certain significant partners can determine and change unilaterally certain key terms and conditions including the ability to change their user and developer policies and guidelines in many cases these partners also set the rates that we must pay to provide our games and services through their online channels and retain flexibility to change their fee structures or adopt different fee structures for their online channels which could adversely impact our costs profitability and margins these partners also control the information technology systems through which online sales of our products and service channels are captured if our partners establish terms that restrict our offerings significantly impact the financial terms on which these products or services are offered to our customers or their information technology systems experiences outages that impact our players’ ability to access our games or purchase extra content or cause an unanticipated delay in reporting our business andor financial results could be materially affected 

the products or services we release may contain defects bugs or errors 

our products and services are extremely complex software programs and are difficult to develop and distribute we have quality controls in place to detect defects bugs or other errors in our products and services before they are released nonetheless these quality controls are subject to human error overriding and resource or technical constraints in addition the effectiveness of our quality controls and preventative measures may be negatively affected by the distribution of our workforce resulting from the covid19 pandemic as such these quality controls and preventative measures may not be effective in detecting all defects bugs or errors in our products and services before they have been released into the marketplace in such an event the technological reliability and stability of our products and services could be below our standards and the standards of our players and our reputation brand and sales could be adversely affected in addition we could be required to or may find it necessary to offer a refund for the product or service suspend the availability or sale of the product or service or expend significant resources to cure the defect bug or error each of which could significantly harm our business and operating results 

legal and compliance risks 

our business is subject to complex and prescriptive regulations regarding consumer protection and data privacy practices and could be adversely affected if our consumer protection data privacy and security practices are not adequate or perceived as being inadequate 

we are subject to global data privacy data protection localization security and consumerprotection laws and regulations worldwide these laws and regulations are emerging and evolving and the interpretation and application of these laws and regulations often are uncertain contradictory and changing the failure to maintain data practices that are compliant with applicable laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of applicable laws and regulations could result in inquiries from enforcement agencies or direct consumer complaints resulting in civil or criminal penalties and could adversely impact our reputation and brand in addition the operational costs of compliance with these regulations is high and will likely continue to increase even if we remain in strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations consumer sensitivity to the collection and processing of their personal information continues to increase any real or perceived failures in maintaining acceptable data privacy practices including allowing improper or unauthorized access acquisition or misuse andor uninformed disclosure of consumer employee and other information or a perception that we do not adequately secure this information or provide consumers with adequate notice about the information that they authorize us to collect and disclose could result in brand reputational or other harms to the business result in costly remedial measures deter current and potential customers from using our products and services and cause our financial results to be materially affected 

third party vendors and business partners receive access to certain information that we collect these vendors and business partners may not prevent data security breaches with respect to the information we provide them or fully enforce our policies contractual obligations and disclosures regarding the collection use storage transfer and retention of personal data a data security breach of one of our vendors or business partners could cause reputational and financial harm to them and us negatively impact our ability to offer our products and services and could result in legal liability costly remedial measures governmental and regulatory investigations harm our profitability reputation and brand and cause our financial results to be materially affected 

we also are subject to payment card association rules and obligations pursuant to contracts with payment card processors under these rules and obligations if information is compromised we could be liable to payment card issuers for the cost of associated expenses and penalties in addition if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards even if no consumer information is compromised we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs 

government regulations applicable to us may negatively impact our business 

we are a global company subject to various and complex laws and regulations domestically and internationally including laws and regulations related to consumer protection protection of minors content advertising localization information security intellectual property competition and taxation among others many of these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing and the application to and impact on us is uncertain for example the world health organization included “gaming disorder” in the 11th revision of the international classification of diseases prompting discussion and consideration of legislation and policies aimed at mitigating the risk of overuse of and overspending within video games these laws could harm our business by limiting the products and services we can offer consumers or the manner in which we offer them the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in applicable laws or changes to interpretation any failure on our part to comply with these laws or the application of these laws in an unanticipated manner may harm our business and result in penalties or significant legal liability 

certain of our business models and features within our games and services are subject to new laws or regulations or evolving interpretations and application of existing laws and regulations including those related to gambling the growth and development of electronic commerce virtual items and virtual currency has prompted calls for new laws and regulations and resulted in the application of existing laws or regulations that have limited or restricted the sale of our products and services in certain territories for example governmental organizations have applied existing laws and regulations to certain mechanics commonly included within our games including the ultimate team mode associated with our sports franchises in addition we include modes in our games that allow players to compete against each other and manage player competitions that are based on our products and services although we structure and operate our skillbased competitions with applicable laws in mind including those related to gambling our skillbased competitions in the future could become subject to evolving laws and regulations we are also introducing features into our games and services that allow players to create and share usergenerated content such content may be objectionable or offensive and decrease engagement with our products and services cause a loss of confidence in our brands and expose us to liability and regulatory oversight particularly as applicable global laws and 

regulations are introduced and evolve new laws related to these business models and features or the interpretation or application of current laws that impact these business models and features  each of which could vary significantly across jurisdictions  could subject us to additional regulation and oversight cause us to further limit or restrict the sale of our products and services or otherwise impact our products and services lessen the engagement with and growth of profitable business models and expose us to increased compliance costs significant liability fines penalties and harm to our reputation and brand 

we are subject to laws in certain foreign countries and adhere to industry standards in the united states that mandate rating requirements or set other restrictions on the advertisement or distribution of interactive entertainment software based on content in addition certain foreign countries allow government censorship of interactive entertainment software products or require preapproval processes of uncertain length before our games and services can be offered adoption of ratings systems censorship restrictions on distribution and changes to approval processes or the status of any approvals could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our consumers in addition compliance with new and possibly inconsistent regulations for different territories could be costly delay or prevent the release of our products in those territories 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights 

from time to time third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights although we take steps to avoid knowingly violating the intellectual property rights of others it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement existing or future infringement claims against us may be expensive to defend and divert the attention of our employees from business operations such claims or litigation could require us to pay damages and other costs we also could be required to stop selling distributing or supporting products features or services which incorporate the affected intellectual property rights redesign products features or services to avoid infringement or obtain a license all of which could be costly and harm our business 

in addition many patents have been issued that may apply to potential new modes of delivering playing or monetizing products and services such as those that we produce or would like to offer in the future we may discover that future opportunities to provide new and innovative modes of game play and game delivery may be precluded by existing patents that we are unable to acquire or license on reasonable terms 

from time to time we may become involved in other legal proceedings 

we are currently and from time to time in the future may become subject to legal proceedings claims litigation and government investigations or inquiries which could be expensive lengthy disruptive to normal business operations and occupy a significant amount of our employees’ time and attention in addition the outcome of any legal proceedings claims litigation investigations or inquiries may be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating results or financial condition 

our products and brands are subject to intellectual property infringement including in jurisdictions that do not adequately protect our products and intellectual property rights 

we regard our products brands and intellectual property as proprietary and take measures to protect our assets from infringement we are aware that some unauthorized copying of our products and brands occurs and if a significantly greater amount were to occur it could negatively impact our business further our products and services are available worldwide and the laws of some countries particularly in asia either do not protect our products brands and intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the united states or are poorly enforced legal protection of our rights may be ineffective in countries with weaker intellectual property enforcement mechanisms in addition certain third parties have registered our intellectual property rights without authorization in foreign countries successfully registering such intellectual property rights could limit or restrict our ability to offer products and services based on such rights in those countries although we take steps to enforce and police our rights our practices and methodologies may not be effective against all eventualities 

financial risks 

our financial results are subject to currency and interest rate fluctuations 

international sales are a fundamental part of our business for our fiscal year ended march 31 2021 international net revenue comprised 56 percent of our total net revenue and we expect our international business to continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue as a result of our international sales and also the denomination of our foreign investments and our cash and cash equivalents in foreign currencies we are exposed to the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates remains elevated as compared to historic levels strengthening of the 

us dollar particularly relative to the euro british pound sterling australian dollar japanese yen chinese yuan south korean won and polish zloty has a negative impact on our reported international net revenue but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses particularly when the us dollar strengthens against the swedish krona and the canadian dollar because these amounts are translated at lower rates we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency risk however these activities are limited in the protection they provide us from foreign currency fluctuations and can themselves result in losses in addition interest rate volatility including lower interest rates resulting from actions taken in connection with the covid19 pandemic can decrease the amount of interest earned on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment portfolio 

we utilize debt financing and such indebtedness could adversely impact our business and financial condition 

we have 19 billion in senior unsecured notes outstanding as well as an unsecured 500 million revolving credit facility while the facility is currently undrawn we may use the proceeds of any future borrowings for general corporate purposes we may also enter into other financial instruments in the future 

this indebtedness and any indebtedness that we may incur in the future could affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

• requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow for other purposes including capital expenditures share repurchases acquisitions or otherwise funding our growth strategy 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and 

• increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business or adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions 

the agreements governing our indebtedness impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants in particular the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with a debt to ebitda ratio our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of these covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable there can be no assurance that any refinancing or additional financing would be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us if at all in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities as well as the potential costs associated with any potential refinancing our indebtedness downgrades in our credit rating could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities and changes to tax laws and interpretations of tax laws could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision tax assets and accruals for other taxes and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective income tax rate is based in part on our corporate operating structure and the manner in which we operate our business and develop value and use our intellectual property taxing authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate have and may continue to challenge and audit our methodologies for calculating our income taxes which could increase our effective income tax rate and have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows in addition our provision for income taxes is materially affected by our profit levels changes in our business changes in our geographic mix of earnings changes in the elections we make changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in our corporate structure changes in applicable accounting rules or changes in applicable tax laws or interpretations of existing income and withholding tax laws as well as other factors for example the outcome of future guidance related to the us tax act could cause us to change our analysis and materially impact our previous estimates and consolidated financial statements the impact of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies could result in significant fluctuations to our effective tax rate 

in addition changes to us federal state or international tax laws or their applicability to corporate multinationals in the countries in which we do business particularly in switzerland where our international business is headquartered and actions we have taken in our business with respect to such laws have affected and could continue to affect our effective tax rates and cash taxes cause us to change the way in which we structure our business and result in other costs our effective tax rate also could be adversely affected by changes in our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets our valuation allowances in turn 

can be impacted by several factors including changes to the expected mix and timing of product releases and future taxable income expected growth rates of future taxable income which are based primarily on third party market and industry growth data changes in interest rates and actions we take in connection with acquisitions significant judgment is involved in determining the amount of valuation allowances and actual financial results also may differ materially from our current estimates and could have a material impact on our assessments 

we are required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property transfer and goods and services taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions several foreign jurisdictions have introduced new digital services taxes on revenue of companies that provide certain digital services or expanded their interpretation of existing tax laws with regard to other nonincome taxes there is limited guidance about the applicability of these new taxes or changing interpretations to our business and significant uncertainty as to what will be deemed in scope if these foreign taxes are applied to us it could have an adverse and material impact on our business and financial performance 

general risks 

our business is subject to economic market and geopolitical conditions 

our business is subject to economic market public health and geopolitical conditions which are beyond our control the united states and other international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time worsening economic conditions that negatively impact discretionary consumer spending and consumer demand including inflation slower growth recession and other macroeconomic conditions including those resulting from and that may persist from public health outbreaks such as the covid19 pandemic and geopolitical issues such as the impact from the united kingdom’s departure from the european union could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we are particularly susceptible to market conditions and risks associated with the entertainment industry which in addition to general macroeconomic downturns also include the popularity price and timing of our games changes in consumer demographics the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to our operating results or factors specific to our operating results including those discussed in the risk factors above as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our future financial performance ratings or recommendations our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts’ and investors’ expectations the failure of our capital return programs to meet analysts’ and investors’ expectations the announcement and integration of any acquisitions we may make departure of key personnel cyberattacks or factors largely outside of our control including those affecting interactive gaming entertainment andor technology companies generally national or international economic conditions investor sentiment or other factors related or unrelated to our operating performance in particular economic downturns may contribute to the public stock markets experiencing extreme price and trading volume volatility these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

future outlook  the full extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic to our business operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that cannot be accurately predicted at this time such as the duration and spread of the pandemic the extent speed and effectiveness of worldwide containment and vaccination efforts and the impact of these and other factors on our employees customers partners and vendors trends from fiscal year 2021 that benefited our industry and business may not be indicative of results for future periods particularly as factors related to the covid19 pandemic lessen and consumers can engage with other forms of entertainment if the trend towards digital adoption decelerates or if global macroeconomic effects of the covid19 pandemic persist even after the pandemic has subsided additional factors that could impact our business include our ability to timely deliver high quality and technically stable games and services while our teams including our development teams work in a distributed environment our ability to safely reintroduce our employees to our offices when it is appropriate to do so and other factors included in part i item 1a of this annual report under the heading “risk factors” 

live services business we offer our players highquality experiences designed to provide value to players and to extend and enhance gameplay these live services include extra content subscription offerings and other revenue generated outside of the sale of our base games our net revenue attributable to live services and other was 4016 million 3650 million and 3157 million for the fiscal years ended march 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively and we expect that live services net revenue will continue to be material to our business within live services and other net revenue attributable to extra content was 3068 million 2826 million and 2373 million for the fiscal years ended march 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively extra content net revenue has increased as players engage with our games and services over longer periods of time and purchase additional content designed to provide value to players and extend and enhance gameplay our most popular live service is the extra content purchased for the ultimate team mode associated with our sports franchises ultimate team allows players to collect current and former professional players in order to build and compete as a personalized team net revenue from extra content sales for ultimate team was 1623 million 1491 million and 1369 million during fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively a substantial portion of which was derived from fifa ultimate team 

digital delivery of games in our industry players increasingly purchase games digitally as opposed to purchasing physical discs while this trend as applied to our business may not be linear because of product mix during a fiscal year consumer buying patterns and other factors over time we expect players to purchase an increasingly higher proportion of our games digitally therefore we expect net revenue attributable to digital full game downloads to increase over time and net revenue attributable to sales of packaged goods to decrease 

our net revenue attributable to digital full game downloads was 918 million 811 million and 681 million during fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively while our net revenue attributable to packaged goods sales decreased from 1112 million in fiscal year 2019 to 1076 million in fiscal year 2020 and 695 million in fiscal year 2021 in addition as measured based on total units sold on microsoft’s xbox one and xbox series x and sony’s playstation 4 and 5 rather than by net revenue we estimate that 62 percent 49 percent and 49 percent of our total units sold during fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 were sold digitally digital full game units are based on sales information provided by microsoft and sony packaged goods units sold through are estimated by obtaining data from significant retail partners in north america europe and asia and applying internal sales estimates with respect to retail partners from which we do not obtain data we believe that these percentages are 

reasonable estimates of the proportion of our games that are digitally downloaded in relation to our total number of units sold for the applicable period of measurement 

during fiscal year 2021 the percentage of our full games purchased digitally accelerated likely aided by factors associated with the covid19 pandemic including store closures of our key retail partners for a portion of fiscal year 2021 while digital adoption may decelerate in fiscal year 2022 as factors related to the covid19 pandemic lessen or if global macroeconomic effects of the covid19 pandemic persist even after the pandemic has subsided we believe that the significant increase in digital adoption we experienced in fiscal year 2021 is likely a permanent structural change increases in consumer adoption of digital purchase of games combined with increases in our live services revenue generally results in expansion of our gross margin as costs associated with selling a game digitally is generally less than selling the same game through traditional retail and distribution channels 

freetoplay games the global adoption of mobile devices and a business model for those devices that allows consumers to try new games with no upfront cost and that are monetized through a live service associated with the game particularly extra content sales has led to significant sales growth in the mobile gaming industry similarly sales of extra content are the primary driver of our mobile business we are investing resources in our mobile business seeking to maximize our mobile live services innovate on mobile with our franchises and have added additional growth opportunities through mergers and acquisitions activity likewise the consumer acceptance of freetoplay live servicebased online pc games has broadened our consumer base and has begun to expand into the console market for example within our business we offer apex legends as a freetoplay live servicebased pc and console game we expect extra content revenue generated from mobile pc and console freetoplay games to continue to be an important part of our business 

concentration of sales among the most popular games  in all major segments of our industry we see a large portion of games sales concentrated on the most popular titles similarly a significant portion of our revenue historically has been derived from games based on a few popular franchises several of which we have released on an annual or biannual basis in particular we have historically derived a significant portion of our net revenue from our largest and most popular game fifa the annualized version of which is consistently one of the bestselling games in the marketplace 

recurring revenue sources our business model includes revenue that we deem recurring in nature such as revenue from our annualized sports franchises eg fifa madden nfl our console pc and mobile catalog titles ie titles that did not launch in the current fiscal year and our live services we have been able to forecast revenue from these areas of our business with greater relative confidence than for new games services and business models as we continue to incorporate new business models and modalities of play into our games our goal is to continue to look for opportunities to expand the recurring portion of our business 

net bookings  in order to improve transparency into our business we disclose an operating performance metric net bookings net bookings is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or soldin physically in the period net bookings is calculated by adding total net revenue to the change in deferred net revenue for onlineenabled games 

the following is a calculation of our total net bookings for the periods presented 



a at the beginning of fiscal year 2021 we changed the way in which we present net bookings to align with gaap net revenue measures net bookings from mobile platform partners are now presented gross of platform provider fees historically we presented net bookings from these partners net of platform fees net bookings for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 has been recast for comparability 

net bookings were 6190 million for fiscal year 2021 driven by sales related to fifa 21  apex legends fifa 20 the sims 4 and madden nfl 21  net bookings increased 818 million or 15 percent as compared to fiscal year 2020 primarily driven by the fifa franchise apex legends star wars galaxy of heroes  the sims 4  and the madden franchise partially offset by star wars jedi fallen order battlefield v and need for speed heat live services and other net bookings were 4592 million for fiscal year 2021 and increased 1000 million or 28 percent as compared to fiscal year 2020 the increase in live services and other net bookings was due primarily to an increase in sales of extra content for ultimate team apex legends star wars galaxy of heroes and the sims 4  full game net bookings were 1598 million for fiscal year 2021 and decreased 182 

million or 10 percent as compared to fiscal year 2020 due to star wars jedi fallen order  partially offset by star wars squadrons and ufc 4  

mergers and acquisitions 

acquisition of glu mobile  subsequent to the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 we completed the acquisition of glu mobile inc a leading global developer and publisher of mobile games “glu” and the “glu acquisition” for cash consideration of approximately 23 billion we also assumed all outstanding unvested equity awards held by glu employees we expect the glu acquisition to accelerate our mobile growth by creating a combined organization with ongoing live services across multiple games and genres we also believe that the acquisition will create value by adding glu’s expertise in casual sports and lifestyle genres to new titles based on our intellectual property glu will be integrated into the company for financial reporting purposes in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2022 for more information about the glu acquisition see part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in note 7 — business combinations

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities contingent assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the covid19 pandemic as a result actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

revenue recognition 

we derive revenue principally from sales of our games and related extra content and services that can be played on game consoles pcs mobile phones and tablets our product and service offerings include but are not limited to the following 

• full games with both online and offline functionality “games with services” which generally includes 1 the initial game delivered digitally or via physical disc at the time of sale and typically provide access to offline core game content “software license” 2 updates on a whenandifavailable basis such as software patches or updates andor additional free content to be delivered in the future “future update rights” and 3 a hosted connection for online playability “online hosting” 

• full games with onlineonly functionality which require an internet connection to access all gameplay and functionality “onlinehosted service games” 

• extra content related to games with services and onlinehosted service games which provides access to additional ingame content 

• subscriptions such as ea play and ea play pro that generally offers access to a selection of full games ingame content online services and other benefits typically for a recurring monthly or annual fee and 

• licensing to third parties to distribute and host our games and content 

we evaluate and recognize revenue by 

• identifying the contracts with the customer 

• identifying the performance obligations in the contract 

• determining the transaction price 

• allocating the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract and 

• recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied through the transfer of a promised good or service to a customer ie “transfer of control” 

certain of our full game andor extra content are sold to resellers with a contingency that the full game andor extra content cannot be resold prior to a specific date “street date contingency” we recognize revenue for transactions that have a street date contingency when the street date contingency is removed and the full game andor extra content can be resold by the reseller for digital full game andor extra content downloads sold to customers we recognize revenue when the full game andor extra content is made available for download to the customer 

onlineenabled games 

games with services our sales of games with services are evaluated to determine whether the software license future update rights and the online hosting are distinct and separable sales of games with services are generally determined to have three distinct performance obligations software license future update rights and the online hosting 

since we do not sell the performance obligations on a standalone basis we consider market conditions and other observable inputs to estimate the standalone selling price for each performance obligation for games with services generally 75 percent of the sales price is allocated to the software license performance obligation and recognized at a point in time when control of the license has been transferred to the customer which is usually at or near the same time as the booking of the transaction the remaining 25 percent is allocated to the future update rights and the online hosting performance obligations and recognized ratably as the service is provided over the estimated offering period 

onlinehosted service games sales of our onlinehosted service games are determined to have one distinct performance obligation the online hosting we recognize revenue from these arrangements as the service is provided 

extra content revenue received from sales of downloadable content are derived primarily from the sale of virtual currencies and digital ingame content that are designed to extend and enhance players’ game experience sales of extra content are accounted for in a manner consistent with the treatment for our games with services and onlinehosted service games as discussed above depending upon whether or not the extra content has offline functionality that is if the extra content has offline functionality then the extra content is accounted for similarly to games with services generally determined to have three distinct performance obligations software license future update rights and the online hosting if the extra content does not have offline functionality then the extra content is determined to have one distinct performance obligation the onlinehosted service offering 

subscriptions 

sales of our subscriptions are deemed to be one performance obligation and we recognize revenue from these arrangements ratably over the subscription term as the performance obligation is satisfied 

licensing revenue 

in certain countries we utilize thirdparty licensees to distribute and host our games and content in accordance with license agreements for which the licensees typically pay us a fixed minimum guarantee andor salesbased royalties these arrangements typically include multiple performance obligations such as a timebased license of software and future update rights we recognize as revenue a portion of the minimum guarantee when we transfer control of the license of software generally upon commercial launch and the remaining portion ratably over the contractual term in which we provide the licensee with future update rights any salesbased royalties are generally recognized as the related sales occur by the licensee 

significant judgments around revenue arrangements 

identifying performance obligations performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct ie the customer can benefit from the goods or services either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and are distinct in the context of the contract ie it is separately identifiable from other goods or services in the contract to the extent a contract includes multiple promises we must apply judgment to determine whether those promises are separate and distinct performance obligations if these criteria are not met the promises are accounted for as a combined performance obligation 

determining the transaction price the transaction price is determined based on the consideration that we will be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring our goods and services to the customer determining the transaction price often requires judgment based on an assessment of contractual terms and business practices it further includes review of variable consideration such as discounts sales returns price protection and rebates which is estimated at the time of the transaction in addition the transaction price does not include an estimate of the variable consideration related to salesbased royalties salesbased royalties are recognized as the sales occur 

allocating the transaction price allocating the transaction price requires that we determine an estimate of the relative standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation determining the relative standalone selling price is inherently subjective especially in situations where we do not sell the performance obligation on a standalone basis which occurs in the majority of our transactions in those situations we determine the relative standalone selling price based on various observable inputs using all information that is reasonably available examples of observable inputs and information include historical internal pricing data cost plus margin analyses thirdparty external pricing of similar or same products and services such as software licenses and maintenance support within the enterprise software industry the results of our analysis resulted in a specific percentage of the transaction price being allocated to each performance obligation 

determining the estimated offering period the offering period is the period in which we offer to provide the future update rights andor online hosting for the game and related extra content sold because the offering period is not an explicitly defined period we must make an estimate of the offering period for the servicerelated performance obligations ie future update rights and online hosting determining the estimated offering period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision generally we consider the average period of time customers are online when estimating the offering period we also consider the estimated period of time between the date a game unit is sold to a reseller and the date the reseller sells the game unit to the customer ie time in channel based on these two factors we then consider the method of distribution for example games and extra content sold at retail would have a composite offering period equal to the online gameplay period plus time in channel as opposed to digitallydistributed games and extra content which are delivered immediately via digital download and therefore the offering period is estimated to be only the online gameplay period 

additionally we consider results from prior analyses known and expected online gameplay trends as well as disclosed service periods for competitors’ games in determining the estimated offering period for future sales we believe this provides a reasonable depiction of the transfer of future update rights and online hosting to our customers as it is the best representation of the time period during which our games and extra content are played we recognize revenue for future update rights and online hosting performance obligations ratably on a straightline basis over this period as there is a consistent pattern of delivery for these performance obligations prior to july 1 2020 these performance obligations were generally recognized over an estimated ninemonth period beginning in the month after shipment for games and extra content sold through retail and an estimated sixmonth period for digitallydistributed games and extra content beginning in the month of sale 

during the three months ended september 30 2020 we completed our annual evaluation of the estimated offering period and noted that generally consumers were playing our games for longer periods of time as players engage with services we provide that are designed to enhance and extend gameplay based on this we concluded that the estimated offering period applied to sales made after june 30 2020 should be lengthened revenue for service related performance obligations for games and extra content sold through retail are now recognized over an estimated tenmonth period beginning in the month of sale and revenue for service related performance obligations for digitallydistributed games and extra content are now recognized over an estimated eightmonth period beginning in the month of sale which results in revenue being recognized over a longer period of time this change in estimated offering period did not impact the amount of net bookings or the operating cash flows that we report during the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 this change to our estimated offering period resulted in a decrease in net revenue of  333 million and net income of  280 million and a decrease of  096 diluted earnings per share 

principal agent considerations 

we evaluate sales to end customers of our full games and related content via thirdparty storefronts including digital storefronts such as microsoft’s xbox store sony’s playstation store apple app store and google play store in order to determine whether or not we are acting as the principal in the sale to the end customer which we consider in determining if revenue should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the thirdparty storefront an entity is the principal if it controls a good or service before it is transferred to the end customer key indicators that we evaluate in determining gross versus net treatment include but are not limited to the following 

• the underlying contract terms and conditions between the various parties to the transaction 

• which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service to the end customer 

• which party has inventory risk before the specified good or service has been transferred to the end customer and 

• which party has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service 

based on an evaluation of the above indicators except as discussed below we have determined that generally the third party is considered the principal to end customers for the sale of our full games and related content we therefore report revenue related to these arrangements net of the fees retained by the storefront however for sales arrangements via apple app store and google play store ea is considered the principal to the end customer and thus we report revenue on a gross basis and mobile platform fees are reported within cost of revenue 

fair value estimates 

business combinations we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and acquired inprocess technology in a business combination our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various estimated useful lives furthermore the estimated fair value assigned to an acquired asset or liability has a direct impact on the amount we recognize as goodwill which is an asset that is not amortized determining the fair value of assets acquired requires an assessment of the highest and best use of the asset or group of assets that maximizes the value from a market participant perspective or the expected price to sell the asset and the related expected future cash flows determining the fair value of acquired inprocess technology also requires an assessment of our expectations related to the use of that technology such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both 1 the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and 2 the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carryforwards we do not recognize any deferred taxes related to the us taxes on foreign earnings as we recognize these taxes as a period cost 

we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified it is generally difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is significant negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years forecasts of future taxable income are considered to be less objective than past results therefore cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 

in addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities the carryback of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law and the implementation of tax planning strategies evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence and this evaluation may involve assumptions about future activity certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets 

every quarter we perform a realizability analysis to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized our swiss deferred tax asset realizability analysis relies upon future swiss taxable income as the primary source of taxable income but considers all available sources of swiss income based on the positive and negative evidence we give more weight to evidence that can be objectively verified however there is significant judgment 

involved in estimating future swiss taxable income specifically related to assumptions about expected growth rates of future swiss taxable income which are based primarily on third party market and industry growth data actual results that differ materially from those estimates could have a material impact on our valuation allowance assessment although objectively verifiable swiss interest rates have an impact on the valuation allowance and are based on published swiss guidance any significant changes to such interest rates could result in a material impact to the valuation allowance switzerland has a sevenyear carryforward period and does not permit the carry back of losses changes in estimated offering period and actions we take in connection with acquisitions could also impact the utilization of our swiss deferred tax asset 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate these estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation as well as with respect to other matters such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities the ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations in addition changes in our business including acquisitions changes in our international corporate structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix and amount of income as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities valuation allowances applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective tax rate

our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 was 177 percent as compared to negative 1015 percent for the same period in fiscal year 2020 during the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 we completed an intraentity sale of some of our intellectual property rights to our swiss subsidiary where our international business is headquartered the “swiss intraentity sale” the transaction did not result in a taxable gain under us gaap any profit resulting from this intercompany transaction is eliminated upon consolidation however the transaction resulted in a stepup of the swiss taxdeductible basis in the transferred intellectual property rights and accordingly created a temporary difference between the book basis and the tax basis of such intellectual property rights the “swiss deferred tax asset” 

our effective tax rate and resulting provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 includes a 103 million tax benefit related to changes in our swiss deferred tax asset this benefit was more than offset by a 180 million charge related to our decision to capitalize for income tax purposes certain foreign expenses which increased the taxable income in our foreign entities that is subject to us tax in accordance with our existing accounting policy we do not establish deferred tax assets to offset this charge but we expect future deductions of the capitalized amounts 

our effective tax rate and resulting provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 were significantly impacted by our recognition of the swiss deferred tax asset related to the swiss intraentity sale 

during the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 we recognized a 1840 billion swiss deferred tax asset which is net of the impact of a 131 million valuation allowance and a 393 million reduction due to the impact of the altera opinion the altera opinion also requires related parties in an intercompany costsharing arrangement to share stockbased compensation expenses the altera opinion resulted in the recognition of a onetime charge of 80 million related to prior period us uncertain tax positions during the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 in total during the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 we recognized total onetime tax benefits of 1760 billion related to the 1840 billion swiss deferred tax asset partially offset by the 80 million onetime altera opinion charge 

excluding the impacts of the swiss deferred tax asset and altera opinion our effective tax rate for the year ended march 31 2020 would have been 150 percent our effective tax rate for the year ended march 31 2021 of 177 percent was higher primarily due to the increase in us taxes on foreign earnings which was partially offset by uncertain tax position and valuation allowance benefits 

our effective tax rates for future periods will continue to depend on a variety of factors including changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions our corporate structure the geographic location of business functions or assets the geographic mix of income our agreements with tax authorities applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in our annual pretax income or loss we anticipate that the impact of excess tax benefits tax deficiencies and changes in valuation allowances may result in significant fluctuations to our effective tax rate in the future

changes in cash flow 

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by 137 million during fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 primarily driven by higher collections due to improved performance as we executed against our strategic pillars and increased engagement with our products and services which led to growth in our business aided by players spending more time at home as a result of the covid19 pandemic lower travel and entertainment payments lower inventory costs and lower marketing and advertising payments these increases were partially offset by higher cash payments for income taxes higher personnelrelated costs resulting from an increase in headcount and payments to employees during fiscal year 2021 to assist with workfromhome costs and care needs higher cash outflow from hedging activities higher variable compensation payments related to fiscal year 2020 performance higher prepayments made to contracted services lower interest income higher hosting and platform fees and higher royalty costs 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased by 852 million during fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 primarily driven by a 1544 million increase in proceeds from maturities and sales of shortterm investments and a 531 million decrease in the purchase of shortterm investments these decreases were offset by a payment of 1239 million in connection with our acquisition of codemasters during fiscal year 2021 

financing activities net cash used in financing activities decreased by 1343 million during fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 primarily driven by proceeds from the issuance of the 2031 notes and 2051 notes for 1478 million in february 2021 a 478 million decrease in the repurchase and retirement of our common stock and a 122 million of contingent consideration payment in connection with our acquisition of respawn entertainment llc during the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 these decreases were offset by a repayment of 600 million of our 2021 notes in february 2021 payments of 98 million of cash dividends in the current year and a 61 million increase in cash paid to taxing authorities in connection with withholding taxes for stockbased compensation 

shortterm investments 

due to our mix of fixed and variable rate securities our shortterm investment portfolio is susceptible to changes in shortterm interest rates as of march 31 2021 our shortterm investments had gross unrealized gains of 1 million or less than 1 percent of the total in shortterm investments from time to time we may liquidate some or all of our shortterm investments to fund operational needs or other activities such as capital expenditures business acquisitions or stock repurchase programs 

senior notes 

in february 2021 we issued 750 million aggregate principal amount of the 2031 notes and 750 million aggregate principal amount of the 2051 notes the effective interest rate is 198 for the 2031 notes and 304 for the 2051 notes interest is payable semiannually in arrears on february 15 and august 15 of each year 

in february 2016 we issued 600 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 notes and 400 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 notes the effective interest rate was 394 for the 2021 notes and is 497 for the 2026 notes interest is payable semiannually in arrears on march 1 and september 1 of each year we redeemed 600 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 notes on february 1 2021 plus accrued and unpaid interest of 9 million 

see note 12 — financing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as it relates to our senior notes which is incorporated by reference into this item 7 

credit facility 

on august 29 2019 we entered into a 500 million unsecured revolving credit facility “credit facility” with a syndicate of banks the credit facility terminates on august 29 2024 unless the maturity is extended in accordance with its terms as of march 31 2021 no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility see note 12 — financing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as it relates to our credit facility which is incorporated by reference into this item 7 

financial condition 

our material cash requirements as of march 31 2021 are set forth in our note 14 — commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k which is incorporated by reference into this item 7 we expect capital expenditures to more than double in fiscal year 2022 to approximately 250 million due to facility buildouts we believe that our cash cash equivalents shortterm investments cash generated from operations and available financing facilities will be sufficient to meet these material cash requirements which include debt repayment obligations of 19 billion and fund our operating requirements for the next 12 months and beyond including working capital requirements capital expenditures the implementation of our 26 billion share repurchase program quarterly cash dividend which is currently 017 per share subject to declaration by our board of directors or a designated committee of the board of directors and potentially future acquisitions or strategic investments we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to repay debt strengthen our financial position facilitate expansion repurchase our stock pursue strategic acquisitions and investments andor to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise there can be no assurance however that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms if at all or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 

during fiscal year 2021 we returned 827 million to stockholders through our capital return programs repurchasing 56 million shares for approximately 729 million and 98 million through our quarterly cash dividend program which was initiated in november 2020 

during fiscal year 2021 we also increased our mergers and acquisitions activity completing our acquisition of 100 of the equity interests of codemasters for total cash consideration of 12 billion net of cash acquired on february 18 2021 and completing the acquisition of glu for cash consideration of approximately 23 billion on april 29 2021 we also assumed all outstanding unvested equity awards held by glu employees 

our foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to us tax and to the extent earnings from these subsidiaries can be repatriated without a material tax cost such earnings will not be indefinitely reinvested as of march 31 2021 approximately 11 billion of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions all of our foreign cash is available for repatriation without a material tax cost 

we have a “shelf” registration statement on form s3 on file with the sec this shelf registration statement which includes a base prospectus allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus we would use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes which may include funding for working capital financing capital expenditures research and development marketing and distribution efforts and if opportunities arise for acquisitions or strategic alliances pending such uses we may invest the net proceeds in interestbearing securities in addition we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time 

our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to customer demand and acceptance of our products our ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due successfully achieving our product release schedules and attaining our forecasted sales objectives economic conditions in the united states and abroad the impact of acquisitions and other strategic transactions in which we may engage the impact of competition the seasonal and cyclical nature of our business and operating results and the other risks described in the “ risk factors ” section included in part i item 1a of this report 

as of march 31 2021 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market prices which have experienced significant volatility including increased volatility in connection with the covid19 pandemic market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below while we do not hedge our shortterm investment portfolio we protect our shortterm investment portfolio against different market risks including interest rate risk as discussed below our cash and cash equivalents portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for speculative trading purposes and do not hedge our market price risk relating to marketable equity securities if any 

foreign currency exchange risk 

foreign currency exchange rates international sales are a fundamental part of our business and the strengthening of the us dollar particularly relative to the euro british pound sterling australian dollar japanese yen chinese yuan south korean won and polish zloty has a negative impact on our reported international net revenue but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses particularly the swedish krona and the canadian dollar because these amounts are translated at lower rates as compared to periods in which the us dollar is weaker while we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risk these activities are limited in the protection that they provide us and can themselves result in losses 

cash flow hedging activities we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreigncurrencydenominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing foreign currency forward contracts that generally have maturities of 18 months or less these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements in net revenue and research and development expenses 

balance sheet hedging activities  we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk associated with foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily intercompany receivables and payables these foreign currency forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three months or less and are transacted near monthend 

we believe the counterparties to our foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations as of march 31 2021 a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 20 percent would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value on our foreign currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging of 223 million or 447 million respectively as of march 31 2021 a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 20 percent would have resulted in potential losses in the consolidated statements of operations on our foreign currency forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of 92 million or 184 million respectively this sensitivity analysis assumes an adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates however all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in the same manner and actual results may differ materially see note 5 — derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as it relates to our derivative financial instruments which is incorporated by reference into this item 7a 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities however because shortterm investments mature relatively quickly and if reinvested are invested at the thencurrent market rates interest income on a portfolio consisting of shortterm investments is subject to market fluctuations to a greater extent than a portfolio of longer term investments additionally the contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to call prepay or otherwise settle the investments at prices less than the stated par value our investments are held for purposes other than trading we do not use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio 

as of march 31 2021 our shortterm investments were classified as availableforsale securities and consequently were recorded at fair value with changes in fair value including unrealized gains and unrealized losses not related to credit losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax in stockholders’ equity 

notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our shortterm investment portfolio to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our shortterm investment portfolio we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the portfolio assuming a 150 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve as of march 31 2021 a hypothetical 150 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a 13 million or 1 decrease in the fair market value of our shortterm investments

our packaged goods games are sold directly to mass market retailers specialty stores and through distribution arrangements 

new distribution methods and business models are expected to continue to emerge in the future and we intend to evaluate these opportunities on a casebycase basis 

significant relationships 

sony  microsoft  under the terms of agreements we have entered into with sony computer entertainment inc and its affiliates and with microsoft corporation and its affiliates we are authorized to develop and distribute discbased and digitallydelivered software products and services compatible with playstation and xbox consoles respectively under these agreements with sony and microsoft we have the nonexclusive right to use for a fixed term and in a designated territory technology that is owned or licensed by them to publish our games on their respective consoles with respect to our digitallydelivered products and services the console manufacturers pay us either a wholesale price or a royalty percentage on the revenue they derive from their sales of our products and services our transactions for packaged goods products are made pursuant to individual purchase orders which are accepted on a caseby case basis by sony or microsoft or their designated replicators as the case may be for packaged goods products we pay the console manufacturers a perunit royalty for each unit manufactured many key commercial terms of our relationships with sony and microsoft — such as manufacturing terms delivery times policies and approval conditions — are determined unilaterally and are subject to change by the console manufacturers 

the license agreements also require us to indemnify the console manufacturers for any loss liability and expense resulting from any claim against the console manufacturer regarding our games and services including any claims for patent copyright or trademark infringement brought against the console manufacturer each license may be terminated by the console manufacturer if a breach or default by us is not cured after we receive written notice from the console manufacturer or if we become insolvent the console manufacturers are not obligated to enter into license agreements with us for any future consoles products or services

competition 

the market for interactive entertainment is intensely competitive and changes rapidly as new products business models and distribution channels are introduced we also face competition for the right to use certain intellectual property included in our products in order to remain successful we are required to anticipate sometimes years in advance the ways in which our products and services will compete in the market we face significant competition from companies such as activision blizzard taketwo interactive ubisoft bethesda epic games netease tencent sony microsoft and nintendo primarily with respect to developing games and services that operate on consoles pcs andor mobile devices in addition broader technology companies with significant resources including google apple and amazon are pursuing initiatives in our industry that may compete with us 

more broadly we compete against providers of different sources of entertainment such as movies television social networking online casual entertainment and music that our players could enjoy in their free time important competitive factors in our industry include the ability to attract creative and technical talent game quality and ease of use innovation compatibility of products with certain consoles and other distribution channels brand recognition reputation reliability security creativity price marketing and quality of customer service 

intellectual property and technology 

to establish and protect our intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyrights trademarks patents patent applications trade secrets knowhow license agreements confidentiality provisions and procedures and other contractual provisions we actively engage in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property but the laws of some countries in which we operate particularly in asia either do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the united states or are poorly enforced as our digital business has grown our games and services increasingly depend on the reliability availability and security of our technological infrastructure our industry is prone to and our systems and 

networks are subject to actions by malfeasant actors such as cyberattacks and other information security incidents while we devote financial and operational resources to implement systems processes and technologies to guard against cyber events and to help protect our intellectual property employee and consumer data and information technology systems against intrusions or other security breaches we have experienced such events in the past and expect future events to occur in addition we engage in activities designed to limit the impact of abuse of our digital products and services including monitoring our games for evidence of exploitation and rebalancing our game environments in the event that such abuse is discovered 

governmental regulation 

we are a global company subject to various and complex laws and regulations domestically and internationally including laws and regulations related to user privacy data collection and retention consumer protection protection of minors content advertising localization information security intellectual property competition and taxation among others many of these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing and the application to and impact on us is uncertain certain of our business models are subject to new laws or regulations or evolving interpretations and application of existing laws and regulations including those related to gambling the growth and development of electronic commerce virtual items and virtual currency has prompted calls for new laws and regulations and resulted in the application of existing laws or regulations that have limited or restricted the sale of our products and services in certain territories 

seasonality 

we have historically experienced the highest percentage of our net bookings in our third fiscal quarter due to seasonal holiday demand and the launch timing of our games while we expect this trend to continue in fiscal year 2021 there is no assurance that it will 

employees 

as of march 31 2020 we had approximately 9800 regular fulltime employees over 6000 of whom were outside the united states we believe that our ability to attract train motivate and retain qualified employees is a critical factor in the successful development of our products and services and that our future success will depend in large measure on our ability to continue attracting training motivating and retaining qualified employees approximately 7 percent of our employees all of whom work for our dice development studio in sweden are represented by a union

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance in the past we have experienced certain of the events and circumstances described below which adversely impacted our business and financial performance if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs our business or financial performance could be harmed our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe could be material that may harm our business or financial performance 

our business is intensely competitive we may not deliver successful and engaging products and services or consumers may prefer our competitors’ products or services over our own 

competition in our business is intense many new products and services are regularly introduced but only a relatively small number of products and associated services drive significant engagement and account for a significant portion of total revenue our competitors range from established interactive entertainment companies and diversified media companies to emerging startups and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge throughout the world if our competitors develop and market more successful and engaging products or services offer competitive products or services at lower price points or if we do not continue to develop consistently highquality wellreceived and engaging products and services our revenue margins and profitability will decline 

we strive to create innovative and highquality products and services that allow us to build ongoing and meaningful relationships with our community however innovative and highquality titles even if highlyreviewed may not meet our expectations many financially successful products and services within our industry are iterations of prior titles with large established consumer bases and significant brand recognition which makes competing in certain categories challenging in addition products or services of our direct competitors or other entertainment companies may take a larger portion of consumer spending or time than we anticipate which could cause our products and services to underperform relative to our expectations a significant portion of our revenue historically has been derived from products and services based on a few popular franchises and the underperformance of a single major title has had and could in the future have a material adverse impact on our financial results for example we have historically derived a significant portion of our net revenue from sales related to our largest and most popular game fifa annualized versions of which are consistently one of the bestselling games in the marketplace any events or circumstances that negatively impact our fifa franchise such as product or service quality competing products that take a portion of consumer spending and time the delay or cancellation of a product or service launch or real or perceived security risks could negatively impact our financial results to a disproportionate extent 

the increased importance of live services including extra content to our business heightens the risks associated with the products for which such live services are offered live services that are either poorlyreceived or provided in connection with underperforming games may generate lower than expected sales any lapse delay or failure in our ability to provide highquality live services content to consumers over an extended period of time could materially and adversely affect our financial results consumer engagement with our live services and cause harm to our reputation and brand our most popular live service is the extra content available for the ultimate team mode associated with our sports franchises any events or circumstances that negatively impact our ability to reliably provide content or sustain engagement for ultimate team  particularly fifa ultimate team  would negatively impact our financial results to a disproportionate extent 

our business is subject to economic market and geopolitical conditions 

our business is subject to economic market public health and geopolitical conditions which are beyond our control the united states and other international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time worsening economic conditions that negatively impact discretionary consumer spending and consumer demand including inflation slower growth recession and other macroeconomic conditions including those resulting from public health outbreaks such as the covid19 pandemic and geopolitical issues could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results in addition the united kingdom’s departure from the european union has caused economic and legal uncertainty in the region and may result in macroeconomic conditions that adversely affect our business 

we are particularly susceptible to market conditions and risks associated with the entertainment industry which in addition to general macroeconomic downturns also include the popularity price and timing of our games changes in consumer demographics the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted 

catastrophic events may disrupt our business 

natural disasters cyberincidents weather events wildfires power disruptions telecommunications failures public health outbreaks failed upgrades of existing systems or migrations to new systems acts of terrorism or other events could cause outages disruptions andor degradations of our infrastructure including our or our partners’ information technology and network systems a failure in our ability to conduct normal business operations or the closure of public spaces in which players engage with our games and services the health and safety of our employees players thirdparty organizations with whom we partner or regulatory agencies on which we rely could be also affected which may prevent us from executing against our business strategies or cause a decrease in consumer demand for our products and services system redundancy may be ineffective and our disaster recovery and business continuity planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures disruptions closures or inability to conduct normal business operations could also prevent access to our products services or online stores selling our products and services cause delay or interruption in our product or live services offerings allow breaches of data security or result in the loss of critical data several of our key locations are closed as a result of the covid19 pandemic including our global headquarters in redwood shores california and key studios across north america europe and asia and the distribution of our workforce could disrupt out ability to conduct normal business operations our corporate headquarters and several of our key studios also are located in seismically active regions an event that results in the disruption or degradation of any of our critical business functions or information technology systems harms our ability to conduct normal business operations or causes a decreased in consumer demand for our products and services could materially impact our reputation and brand financial condition and operating results 

we may not meet our product and live service development schedules and key events sports seasons andor movies that are tied to our product and live service release schedule may be delayed cancelled or poorly received 

our ability to meet product and live service development schedules is affected by a number of factors both within and outside our control including feedback from our players the creative processes involved the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams the complexity of our products and the platforms for which they are developed the need to finetune our products prior to their release and in certain cases approvals from third parties during the worldwide covid19 pandemic our ability to meet product and live service development schedules will be challenged as we have closed key studios across north america europe and asia and moved to a distributed workforce for certain of our development teams we have experienced development delays for our products in the past which caused us to delay or cancel release dates any failure to meet anticipated production or release schedules likely would result in a delay of revenue andor possibly a significant shortfall in our revenue increase our development andor marketing expenses harm our profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different than anticipated if we miss key selling periods for products or services particularly the fiscal quarter ending in december for any reason including product delays or product cancellations our sales likely will suffer significantly 

we also seek to release certain products and extra content for our live services  such as our sports franchises and the associated ultimate team live service  in conjunction with key events such as the beginning of a sports season events associated with the sports calendar or the release of a related movie if such seasons or events were delayed cancelled or poorly received our sales could suffer materially for example the worldwide covid19 pandemic has resulted in the disruption postponement and cancellation of sports seasons and sporting events continued disruption postponement and cancellation of sports seasons and sporting events around which we seek to launch our games and provide live services could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

our industry changes rapidly and we may fail to anticipate or successfully implement new or evolving technologies or adopt successful business strategies distribution methods or services 

rapid changes in our industry require us to anticipate sometimes years in advance the ways in which our products and services will be competitive in the market we have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies technologies distribution methods products and services there can be no assurance that these strategic investments will achieve expected returns for example we are investing in the technological infrastructure that we expect will enable us to deliver content that will resonate with players and provide more choice in the way that players connect with their games with each other and with new types of content such endeavors involve significant risks and uncertainties no assurance can be given that the technology we choose to implement the business strategies we choose to adopt and the products and services that we pursue will achieve financial results that meet or exceed our expectations our reputation and brand could also be adversely affected we also may miss opportunities or fail to respond quickly enough to adopt technology or distribution methods or develop products services or new ways to engage with our games that become popular with consumers which could adversely affect our financial results 

our development process usually starts with particular platforms and distribution methods in mind and a range of technical development feature and ongoing goals that we hope to be able to achieve we may not be able to achieve these goals or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly and in a way that better engages consumers in either case our products and services may be technologically inferior to those of our competitors less appealing to consumers or both if we cannot achieve our goals within the original development schedule for our products and services then we may delay their release until these goals can be achieved which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses alternatively we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies either to preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up with our competition which would increase our development expenses 

we may experience security breaches and cyber threats 

the integrity of our and our partners’ information technology networks and systems is critical to our ongoing operations products and services our industry is prone to and our systems and networks are subject to actions by malfeasant actors such as cyberattacks and other information security incidents that seek to exploit disable damage andor disrupt our networks business operations products and services and supporting technological infrastructure or gain access to consumer and employee personal information our intellectual property and other assets in addition our systems and networks could be harmed or improperly accessed due to error by employees or third parties that are authorized to access to these networks and systems we also rely on technological infrastructure provided by thirdparty business partners to support the online functionality of our products and services who are also subject to these same cyber risks both our partners and we have expended and expect to continue to expend financial and operational resources to guard against cyber risks and to help protect our data and systems however the techniques used by malfeasant actors changes frequently continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and often are not detected for long periods of time as a result of the covid19 pandemic remote access to our networks and systems has increased substantially while we have taken steps to secure our networks and systems we may be more vulnerable to a successful cyberattack or information security incident while our workforce remains distributed the costs to respond to mitigate andor notify affected parties of cyberattacks and other security vulnerabilities are significant in addition such events could compromise the confidentiality integrity or accessibility of these networks and systems or result in the compromise or loss of the data including personal data processed by these systems consequences of such events have included and could in the future include the loss of proprietary and personal data and interruptions or delays in our business operations as well as loss of player confidence and damage to our brand and reputation in addition such events could cause us to be noncompliant with applicable regulations subject us to legal claims or penalties under laws protecting the privacy or security of personal information or proprietary material information we have experienced such events in the past and expect future events to occur 

in addition the virtual economies that we have established in many of our games are subject to abuse exploitation and other forms of fraudulent activity that can negatively impact our business virtual economies involve the use of virtual currency andor virtual assets that can be used or redeemed by a player within a particular game or service the abuse or exploitation of our virtual economies have included the illegitimate generation and sale of virtual items including in black markets our online services have been impacted by ingame exploits and the use of automated or other fraudulent processes to generate virtual item or currency illegitimately and such activity may continue these abuses and exploits and the steps that we take to address these abuses and exploits may result in a loss of anticipated revenue increased costs to protect against or remediate these issues interfere with players’ enjoyment of a balanced game environment and cause harm to our reputation and brand 

our business is subject to complex and prescriptive regulations regarding consumer protection and data privacy practices and could be adversely affected if our consumer protection data privacy and security practices are not adequate or perceived as being inadequate  

we are subject to global data privacy data protection localization security and consumerprotection laws and regulations worldwide these laws and regulations are emerging and evolving and the interpretation and application of these laws and regulations often are uncertain contradictory and changing the failure to maintain data practices that are compliant with applicable laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of applicable laws and regulations could result in inquiries from enforcement agencies or direct consumer complaints resulting in civil or criminal penalties and could adversely impact our reputation and brand in addition the operational costs of compliance with these regulations is high and will likely continue to increase 

even if we remain in strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations consumer sensitivity to the collection and processing of their personal information continues to increase any real or perceived failures in maintaining acceptable data privacy practices including allowing improper or unauthorized access acquisition or misuse andor uninformed disclosure of 

consumer employee and other information or a perception that we do not adequately secure this information or provide consumers with adequate notice about the information that they authorize us to collect and disclose could result in brand reputational or other harms to the business result in costly remedial measures deter current and potential customers from using our products and services and cause our financial results to be materially affected 

third party vendors and business partners receive access to certain information that we collect these vendors and business partners may not prevent data security breaches with respect to the information we provide them or fully enforce our policies contractual obligations and disclosures regarding the collection use storage transfer and retention of personal data a data security breach of one of our vendors or business partners could cause reputational and financial harm to them and us negatively impact our ability to offer our products and services and could result in legal liability costly remedial measures governmental and regulatory investigations harm our profitability reputation and brand and cause our financial results to be materially affected 

we also are subject to payment card association rules and obligations pursuant to contracts with payment card processors under these rules and obligations if information is compromised we could be liable to payment card issuers for the cost of associated expenses and penalties in addition if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards even if no consumer information is compromised we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs 

we may experience outages disruptions or degradations in our services products andor technological infrastructure 

the reliable performance of our products and services depends on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology systems and those of our external service providers including thirdparty “cloud” computing services our games and services are complex software products and maintaining the sophisticated internal and external technological infrastructure required to reliably deliver these games and services is expensive and complex the reliable delivery and stability of our products and services has been and could in the future be adversely impacted by outages disruptions failures or degradations in our network and related infrastructure as well as in the online platforms or services of key business partners that offer support or host our products and services the reliability and stability of our products and services has been affected by events outside of our control as well as by events within our control such as the migration of data among data centers and to thirdparty hosted environments the performance of upgrades and maintenance on our systems and online demand for our products and services that exceeds the capabilities of our technological infrastructure 

if we or our external business partners were to experience an event that caused a significant system outage disruption or degradation or if a transition among data centers or service providers or an upgrade or maintenance session encountered unexpected interruptions unforeseen complexity or unplanned disruptions our products and services may not be available to consumers or may not be delivered reliably and stably as a result our reputation and brand may be harmed consumer engagement with our products and services may be reduced and our revenue and profitability could be negatively impacted we do not have redundancy for all our systems many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities 

as our digital business grows we will require an increasing amount of internal and external technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy the needs of our players we are investing and expect to continue to invest in our own technology hardware and software and the technology hardware and software of external service providers to support our business it is possible that we may fail to scale effectively and grow this technical infrastructure to accommodate increased demands which may adversely affect the reliable and stable performance of our games and services therefore negatively impacting engagement reputation brand and revenue growth 

government regulations applicable to us may negatively impact our business 

we are a global company subject to various and complex laws and regulations domestically and internationally including laws and regulations related to consumer protection protection of minors content advertising localization information security intellectual property competition and taxation among others many of these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing and the application to and impact on us is uncertain for example the world health organization recently included “gaming disorder” in the 11 th revision of the international classification of diseases prompting discussion and consideration of legislation and policies aimed at mitigating the risk of overuse of and overspending within video games these laws could harm our business by limiting the products and services we can offer consumers or the manner in which we offer them the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in applicable laws or 

changes to interpretation any failure on our part to comply with these laws or the application of these laws in an unanticipated manner may harm our business and result in penalties or significant legal liability 

certain of our business models are subject to new laws or regulations or evolving interpretations and application of existing laws and regulations including those related to gambling the growth and development of electronic commerce virtual items and virtual currency has prompted calls for new laws and regulations and resulted in the application of existing laws or regulations that have limited or restricted the sale of our products and services in certain territories for example governmental organizations have applied existing laws and regulations to certain mechanics commonly included within our games including the ultimate team mode associated with our sports franchises in addition we include modes in our games that allow players to compete against each other and manage player competitions that are based on our products and services although we structure and operate our skillbased competitions with applicable laws in mind including those related to gambling our skillbased competitions in the future could become subject to evolving laws and regulations new laws related to these business models or the interpretation or application of current laws that impact these business models  each of which could vary significantly across jurisdictions  could subject us to additional regulation and oversight cause us to further limit or restrict the sale of our products and services or otherwise impact our products and services lessen the engagement with and growth of profitable business models and expose us to increased compliance costs significant liability fines penalties and harm to our reputation and brand 

we are subject to laws in certain foreign countries and adhere to industry standards in the united states that mandate rating requirements or set other restrictions on the advertisement or distribution of interactive entertainment software based on content in addition certain foreign countries allow government censorship of interactive entertainment software products adoption of ratings systems censorship or restrictions on distribution of interactive entertainment software based on content could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our consumers in addition compliance with new and possibly inconsistent regulations for different territories could be costly delay or prevent the release of our products in those territories 

negative perceptions about our business products and services and the communities within our products and services may damage our business and we may incur costs to address concerns 

expectations regarding the quality performance and integrity of our products and services are high players have sometimes been critical of our brands products services online communities business models andor business practices for a wide variety of reasons including perceptions about gameplay fun fairness game content features or services or objections to certain of our business practices these negative responses may not be foreseeable we also may not effectively manage these responses because of reasons within or outside of our control for example we have included in certain games the ability for players to purchase digital items including in some instances virtual “packs” “boxes” or “crates” that contain variable digital items the inclusion of variable digital items in certain games has attracted the attention of our community and if the future implementation of these features creates a negative perception of gameplay fairness or other negative perceptions our reputation and brand could be harmed and revenue could be negatively impacted in addition we have taken actions including delaying the release of our games and delaying or discontinuing features and services for our games after taking into consideration among other things feedback from our community even if those decisions negatively impacted our operating results in the short term we expect to continue to take actions to address concerns as appropriate including actions that may result in additional expenditures and the loss of revenue 

in addition we aim to offer our players safe inclusive and fulfilling online communities we may not be able to maintain healthy longterm online communities within our games and services as a result of the use of those communities as forums for harassment or bullying our inability to successfully discourage overuse of our games and services or overspending within our games and services or the successful implementation of cheating programs although we expend resources and expect to continue to expend resources to maintain healthy online communities our efforts may not be successful due to scale limitations of existing technologies or other factors 

negative sentiment about gameplay fairness our online communities our business practices business models or game content also can lead to investigations or increased scrutiny from governmental bodies and consumer groups as well as litigation which regardless of their outcome may be costly damaging to our reputation and harm our business 

our business depends on the success and availability of consoles systems and devices developed by third parties and our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for those consoles systems and devices 

the success of our business is driven in part by the commercial success and adequate supply of thirdparty consoles systems and devices for which we develop our products and services or through which our products and services are distributed our success depends on our ability to reach a large global audience by accurately predicting which consoles systems and devices will be successful in the marketplace our ability to develop commercially successful products and services that reach players across multiple channels our ability to simultaneously manage products and services on multiple consoles systems and devices and our ability to effectively transition our products and services to new consoles systems and devices we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of the commercial availability of new consoles systems and devices and we may incur significant expense to adjust our product portfolio and development efforts in response to changing consumer preferences additionally we may enter into certain exclusive licensing arrangements that affect our ability to deliver or market products or services on certain consoles systems or devices a console system or device for which we are developing products and services may not succeed as expected or new consoles systems or devices may take market share and interactive entertainment consumers away from those for which we have devoted significant resources if consumer demand for the consoles systems or devices for which we are developing products and services is lower than our expectations we may be unable to fully recover the investments we have made in developing our products and services and our financial performance will be harmed alternatively a console system or device for which we have not devoted significant resources could be more successful than we initially anticipated causing us to not be able to reach our intended audience and take advantage of meaningful revenue opportunities 

external game developers may not meet product development schedules or otherwise honor their obligations 

we contract with external game developers to develop our games or to publish or distribute their games while we maintain contractual protections we have less control over the product development schedules of games developed by external developers we depend on their ability to meet product development schedules which could be negatively affected by among other things the shift to a distributed workforce model resulting from the covid19 pandemic in addition disputes occasionally arise with external developers including with respect to game content launch timing achievement of certain milestones the game development timeline marketing campaigns contractual terms and interpretation if we have disputes with external developers or they cannot meet product development schedules acquire certain approvals or are otherwise unable or unwilling to honor their obligations to us we may delay or cancel previously announced games alter our launch schedule or experience increased costs and expenses which could result in a delay or significant shortfall in anticipated revenue harm our profitability and reputation and cause our financial results to be materially affected 

we may not attract train motivate and retain key personnel 

our business depends on our ability to attract train motivate and retain executive technical creative marketing and other personnel that are essential to the development marketing and support of our products and services the market for highlyskilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive particularly in the geographic locations in which many of our key personnel are located in addition our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting our executives as well as key creative and technical talent we may experience significant compensation costs to hire and retain senior executives and other personnel that we deem critical to our success if we cannot successfully recruit train motivate and retain qualified employees develop and maintain a diverse and inclusive work environment or replace key employees following their departure our ability to develop and manage our business will be impaired 

our marketing and advertising efforts may fail to resonate with consumers 

our products and services are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs an increasing portion of our marketing activity is taking place on social media platforms and through streaming networks influencers and content creators that are outside of our direct control our ability to engage players with our products and services is dependent in part upon the success of these programs and changes to player preferences the impact of athletes celebrities influencers or content creators marketing regulations technology changes or service disruptions may negatively impact our ability to reach and engage our players or otherwise negatively impact our marketing campaigns or the franchises associated with those marketing campaigns moreover if the marketing for our products and services is not innovative or fails to resonate with players particularly during key selling periods or if advertising rates or other media placement costs increase our business and operating results could be harmed 

we may experience declines or fluctuations in the recurring portion of our business 

our business model includes revenue that we deem recurring in nature such as revenue from our annualized sports franchises eg fifa madden nfl our console pc and mobile catalog titles ie titles that did not launch in the current fiscal year 

and our live services while we have been able to forecast the revenue from these areas of our business with greater relative confidence than for new games services and business models we cannot provide assurances that consumer demand will remain consistent including in connection with circumstances outside of our control furthermore we may cease to offer games and services that we previously had deemed to be recurring in nature consumer demand has declined and fluctuated and could in the future decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their level of satisfaction with our games and services our ability to improve and innovate our annualized titles our ability to adapt our games and services to new distribution channels and business models outages and disruptions of online services the games and services offered by our competitors our marketing and advertising efforts or declines in consumer activity generally as a result of economic downturns among others the reception to our sports games also depends in part on the popularity reputation and brand of the leagues organizations and individual athletes with whom we partner events and circumstances outside of our control that have a negative impact on the accessibility popularity reputation and brand of these partners has impacted and could in the future negatively impact sales related to our annualized sports games any decline or fluctuation in the recurring portion of our business may have a negative impact on our financial and operating results 

we could fail to successfully adopt new business models 

from time to time we seek to establish and implement new business models forecasting the success of any new business model is inherently uncertain and depends on a number of factors both within and outside of our control our actual revenue and profit for these businesses may be significantly greater or less than our forecasts in addition these new business models could fail resulting in the loss of our investment in the development and infrastructure needed to support these new business models as well as the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from more successful and established businesses for example we have devoted financial and operational resources to our subscription offerings without any assurance that these businesses will be financially successful while we anticipate growth in this area of our business consumer demand is difficult to predict as a result of a number of factors including satisfaction with our products and services our ability to provide engaging products and services third parties offering their products and services within our subscription partners that provide or don’t provide access to our subscription products and services offered by our competitors reliability of our infrastructure and the infrastructure of our partners pricing the actual or perceived security of our and our partners information technology systems and reductions in consumer spending levels in addition if our subscription offerings are successful sales could be diverted from established business models if we do not select a target price that is optimal for our subscription services maintain our target pricing structure or correctly project renewal rates our financial results may be harmed 

acquisitions investments divestitures and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and other negative consequences 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions including 1 acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets 2 minority investments in strategic partners and 3 investments in new interactive entertainment businesses as part of our longterm business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment that we acquire liabilities that our due diligence process does not identify significant issues liabilities or other challenges diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses in addition we may not integrate these businesses successfully or achieve expected synergies for example we may experience difficulties with the integration of business systems and technologies the integration and retention of new employees the implementation of our internal control and compliance procedures andor the remediation of the internal control and compliance environment of the acquired entity or the maintenance of key business and customer relationships these events could harm our operating results or financial condition 

we may fund strategic transactions with 1 cash which would reduce cash available for other corporate purposes 2 debt which would increase our interest expense and leverage andor 3 equity which would dilute current shareholders’ percentage ownership and also dilute our earnings per share we also may divest or sell assets or a business and we may have difficulty selling such assets or business on acceptable terms in a timely manner this could result in a delay in the achievement of our strategic objectives cause us to incur additional expense or the sale of such assets or business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we anticipated 

we may be unable to maintain or acquire licenses to include intellectual property owned by others in our games or to maintain or acquire the rights to publish or distribute games developed by others 

many of our products and services are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our ea sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues teams and players’ associations and our star wars products include rights licensed from disney competition for these licenses and rights is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses and rights or obtain additional licenses or rights with significant commercial value our ability to develop successful and engaging products and services may be adversely affected and our revenue profitability and cash flows may decline significantly competition for these licenses has increased and may continue to increase the amounts that we must pay to licensors and developers through higher minimum guarantees or royalty rates which could significantly increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

we rely on the consoles systems and devices of partners who have significant influence over the products and services that we offer in the marketplace 

a significant percentage of our digital net revenue is attributable to sales of products and services through our significant partners including sony microsoft apple and google the concentration of a material portion of our digital sales in these partners exposes us to risks associated with these businesses any deterioration in the businesses of our significant partners could disrupt and harm our business including by limiting the methods through which our digital products and services are offered and exposing us to collection risks 

in addition our license agreements typically provide these partners with significant control over the approval and distribution of the products and services that we develop for their consoles systems and devices for products and services delivered via digital channels each respective partner has policies and guidelines that control the promotion and distribution of these titles and the features and functionalities that we are permitted to offer through the channel in addition we are dependent on these partners to invest in and upgrade the capabilities of their systems in a manner than corresponds to the preferences of consumers failure by these partners to keep pace with consumer preferences could have an adverse impact the engagement with our products and services and our ability to merchandise and commercialize our products and services which could harm our business andor financial results 

 moreover certain significant partners can determine and change unilaterally certain key terms and conditions including the ability to change their user and developer policies and guidelines in many cases these partners also set the rates that we must pay to provide our games and services through their online channels and retain flexibility to change their fee structures or adopt different fee structures for their online channels which could adversely impact our costs profitability and margins these partners also control the information technology systems through which online sales of our products and service channels are captured if our partners establish terms that restrict our offerings significantly impact the financial terms on which these products or services are offered to our customers or their information technology systems experiences outages that impact our players’ ability to access our games or purchase extra content or cause an unanticipated delay in reporting our business andor financial results could be materially affected 

during the transition period to new console systems our operating results may be more volatile 

new console systems historically have been developed and released several years apart in periods of transition sales of products for legacy generation consoles typically slow or decline in response to the anticipated and actual introduction of new consoles and sales of products for new generation consoles typically stabilize only after new consoles are widelyestablished with the consumer base sony and microsoft have announced new generation consoles but such consoles have not yet been released consistent with historical transition periods we expect consumers to purchase fewer products for the sony playstation 4 and microsoft xbox one consoles during the upcoming transition period the console transition may have a comparable impact on our live services business potentially increasing the impact on our financial results the transition could accelerate faster than anticipated and may put downward pressure on legacy generation pricing which could negatively affect our operating results our revenue from sales for the new generation consoles from sony and microsoft may not offset the negative effects of the transition on our operating results alternatively adoption of the new generation consoles in which we have made significant investments may be slower than we anticipate or consumer availability may be delayed because of among other things business disruptions resulting from the covid19 pandemic we do not control the release dates or unit volumes of consoles made available for sale the pricing or appeal of new generation consoles or the rates at which consumers purchase these consoles as a result our operating results during this transition may be more volatile and difficult to predict 

our business partners may be unable to honor their obligations to us or their actions may put us at risk 

we rely on various business partners including thirdparty service providers vendors licensing partners development partners and licensees in many areas of our business their actions may put our business and our reputation and brand at risk for 

example we may have disputes with our business partners that may impact our business andor financial results in many cases our business partners may be given access to sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support to our teams and they may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it in addition the failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies or the failure of the third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies could result in a disruption to our business operations further disruptions in the financial markets economic downturns including related to the covid19 pandemic poor business decisions or reputational harm may adversely affect our business partners and they may not be able to continue honoring their obligations to us or we may cease our arrangements with them alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner or vendor if we lose one or more significant business partners our business could be harmed and our financial results could be materially affected 

the products or services we release may contain defects bugs or errors 

our products and services are extremely complex software programs and are difficult to develop and distribute we have quality controls in place to detect defects bugs or other errors in our products and services before they are released nonetheless these quality controls are subject to human error overriding and resource or technical constraints in addition the effectiveness of our quality controls and preventative measures may be negatively affected by the distribution of our workforce resulting from the covid19 pandemic as such these quality controls and preventative measures may not be effective in detecting all defects bugs or errors in our products and services before they have been released into the marketplace in such an event the technological reliability and stability of our products and services could be below our standards and the standards of our players and our reputation brand and sales could be adversely affected in addition we could be required to or may find it necessary to offer a refund for the product or service suspend the availability or sale of the product or service or expend significant resources to cure the defect bug or error each of which could significantly harm our business and operating results 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights 

from time to time third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights although we take steps to avoid knowingly violating the intellectual property rights of others it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement existing or future infringement claims against us may be expensive to defend and divert the attention of our employees from business operations such claims or litigation could require us to pay damages and other costs we also could be required to stop selling distributing or supporting products features or services which incorporate the affected intellectual property rights redesign products features or services to avoid infringement or obtain a license all of which could be costly and harm our business 

in addition many patents have been issued that may apply to potential new modes of delivering playing or monetizing products and services such as those that we produce or would like to offer in the future we may discover that future opportunities to provide new and innovative modes of game play and game delivery may be precluded by existing patents that we are unable to acquire or license on reasonable terms 

from time to time we may become involved in other legal proceedings 

we are currently and from time to time in the future may become subject to legal proceedings claims litigation and government investigations or inquiries which could be expensive lengthy disruptive to normal business operations and occupy a significant amount of our employees’ time and attention in addition the outcome of any legal proceedings claims litigation investigations or inquiries may be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating results or financial condition 

our products and brands are subject to intellectual property infringement including in jurisdictions that do not adequately protect our products and intellectual property rights 

we regard our products brands and intellectual property as proprietary and take measures to protect our assets from infringement we are aware that some unauthorized copying of our products and brands occurs and if a significantly greater amount were to occur it could negatively impact our business further our products and services are available worldwide and the laws of some countries particularly in asia either do not protect our products brands and intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the united states or are poorly enforced legal protection of our rights may be ineffective in countries with weaker intellectual property enforcement mechanisms in addition certain third parties have registered our intellectual property rights without authorization in foreign countries successfully registering such intellectual property rights could limit or restrict 

our ability to offer products and services based on such rights in those countries although we take steps to enforce and police our rights our practices and methodologies may not be effective against all eventualities 

a significant portion of our packaged goods sales are made to a relatively small number of retail and distribution partners and these sales may be disrupted 

we derive a significant percentage of our net revenue attributable to sales of our packaged goods products to our top retail and distribution partners the concentration of a significant percentage of these sales through a few large partners could lead to a shortterm disruption to our business if certain of these partners significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to offer our products the financial position of certain partners has deteriorated and while we maintain protections such as monitoring the credit extended to these partners we could be vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these partners experienced continued deterioration of their business or declared bankruptcy the covid19 pandemic has resulted in closures of the retail stores of certain partners which could negatively impact the sales of our packaged goods products and accelerate deterioration of the financial position of such partners additionally receivables from these partners generally increase in our december fiscal quarter as sales of our products generally increase in anticipation of the holiday season which expose us to heightened risk at that time of year having a significant portion of our packaged goods sales concentrated in a few partners could reduce our negotiating leverage with them if one or more of these partners experience deterioration in their business or become unable to obtain sufficient financing to maintain their operations our business could be harmed 

our financial results are subject to currency and interest rate fluctuations 

international sales are a fundamental part of our business for our fiscal year ended march 31 2020 international net revenue comprised 59 percent of our total net revenue and we expect our international business to continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue as a result of our international sales and also the denomination of our foreign investments and our cash and cash equivalents in foreign currencies we are exposed to the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates has increased in connection with the macroeconomic uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic strengthening of the us dollar particularly relative to the euro british pound sterling australian dollar chinese yuan south korean won and polish zloty has a negative impact on our reported international net revenue but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses particularly when the us dollar strengthens against the swedish krona and the canadian dollar because these amounts are translated at lower rates we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency risk however these activities are limited in the protection they provide us from foreign currency fluctuations and can themselves result in losses in addition interest rate volatility including lower interest rates resulting from actions taken in connection with the covid19 pandemic can decrease the amount of interest earned on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment portfolio 

we utilize debt financing and such indebtedness could adversely impact our business and financial condition 

we have 1 billion in senior unsecured notes outstanding as well as an unsecured 500 million revolving credit facility while the facility is currently undrawn we may use the proceeds of any future borrowings for general corporate purposes we may also enter into other financial instruments in the future 

our indebtedness could affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

• requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund our growth strategy working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions 

the agreements governing our indebtedness impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants in particular the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with a debt to ebitda ratio our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of these covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities as well as the potential costs associated with any potential 

refinancing our indebtedness downgrades in our credit rating could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities and changes to tax laws and interpretations of tax laws could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision tax assets and accruals for other taxes and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective income tax rate is based in part on our corporate operating structure and the manner in which we operate our business and develop value and use our intellectual property taxing authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate have and may continue to challenge and audit our methodologies for calculating our income taxes which could increase our effective income tax rate and have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows in addition our provision for income taxes is materially affected by our profit levels changes in our business changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the elections we make changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in applicable tax laws or interpretations of existing income and withholding tax laws as well as other factors for example the outcome of future guidance related to the us tax act could cause us to change our analysis and materially impact our previous estimates and consolidated financial statements 

in addition changes to us federal state or international tax laws or their applicability to corporate multinationals in the countries in which we do business particularly in switzerland where our international business is headquartered and actions we have taken in our business with respect to such laws have affected our effective tax rates and cash taxes cause us to change the way in which we structure our business and resulted in other costs our effective tax rate also could be adversely affected by changes in our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in particular the partial valuation allowance against our swiss deferred tax assets could be affected by changes in future swiss taxable income expected growth rates of future swiss taxable income which are based primarily on third party market and industry growth data and changes in swiss interest rates the partial valuation allowance is due to the limited sevenyear carry forward period and our scheduling of future swiss taxable income significant judgment is involved in determining the amount of the partial valuation allowance particularly in estimating future swiss taxable income over the period in which the swiss deferred tax assets will reverse and assumptions related to expected growth rates actual financial results also may differ materially from our current estimates and could have a material impact on our assessment of the valuation allowance 

we are required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property transfer and goods and services taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions several foreign jurisdictions have introduced new digital services taxes on revenue of companies that provide certain digital services or expanded their interpretation of existing tax laws with regard to other nonincome taxes there is limited guidance about the applicability of these new taxes or changing interpretations to our business and significant uncertainty as to what will be deemed in scope if these foreign taxes are applied to the company it could have an adverse and material impact on our business and financial performance 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in financial accounting standards 

our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting standards promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies these methods estimates and judgments are subject to risks uncertainties assumptions and changes that could adversely affect our reported financial position and financial results in addition changes to applicable financial accounting standards could impact our reported financial position and financial results for more information on recently adopted accounting standards and recently issued accounting standards applicable to us see part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in note 1 — description of business and basis of presentation under the subheadings “ recently adopted accounting standards ” and “ other recently issued accounting standards ” 

as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue costs and taxes could have an adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to our operating results or factors specific to our operating results including those discussed in the risk factors above as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material 

changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our future financial performance ratings or recommendations our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts’ and investors’ expectations the announcement and integration of any acquisitions we may make departure of key personnel cyberattacks or factors largely outside of our control including those affecting interactive gaming entertainment andor technology companies generally national or international economic conditions investor sentiment or other factors related or unrelated to our operating performance in particular economic downturns may contribute to the public stock markets experiencing extreme price and trading volume volatility these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

trends in our business 

covid19 impact  we are closely monitoring the impact of the covid19 pandemic to our people and our business since the outbreak of covid19 we have focused on actions to support our people our players and communities around the world that have been affected by the covid19 pandemic 

our people  first we have focused on the health and wellbeing of our people and their families during the fiscal quarter ending march 31 2020 we shifted nearly all of our global workforce to work from home in response to the growing threat of the pandemic our it security and digital platform teams mobilized to add capacity to our remote working systems to scale to a distributed workforce and support business continuity to date substantially all of our people outside of shanghai are continuing to work from home we have developed a detailed protocol for how we will evaluate the readiness to return to work for each of our offices around the world accounting for guidance from health authorities and government the comfort level of our employees and preparation of our facilities for continued physical distancing 

our business  throughout this time we have also focused on what we can do for our players we launched our “stay home play together” initiative to bring our players together when physical distancing is keeping us apart and dozens of stay  play programs have been delivered to date with more people staying at home we have experienced and are continuing to experience heightened levels of engagement and live services net bookings growth during the three months ended march 31 2020 and during the current fiscal quarter to date 

future outlook  the full extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic to our business operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to predict for example we do not know when stayathome orders will be eased and lifted and how our products and services will be impacted when that occurs engagement and net bookings could subside additional factors that could impact our business – particularly if stayathome orders remain in place for the longer term or a second wave of stayathome orders is necessary – include our ability to deliver new games and services in a distributed work environment macroeconomic challenges that impact consumer demand the status of sports seasons on which our products and live services are based impacts to our key business partners foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other factors included in part i item 1a of this annual report under the heading “risk factors” 

live services business we offer our players highquality experiences designed to provide value to players and to extend and enhance gameplay these live services include extra content subscription offerings and other revenue generated outside of the sale of our base games our net revenue attributable to digital live services for console and pc was 2813 million 2216 million and 2083 million during fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively and we expect that live services net revenue will continue to be material to our business net revenue attributable to extra content which includes extra content within digital live services for console and pc as well as extra content within our mobile business was 2763 million 2309 million and 2033 million during fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively extra content net revenue has increased as players engage with our games and services over longer periods of time and purchase additional content designed to provide value to players and extend and enhance gameplay our most popular live service is the extra content purchased for the ultimate team mode associated with our sports franchises ultimate team allows players to collect current and former professional players in order to build and compete as a personalized team net revenue from extra content sales for ultimate team was 1491 million 1369 million and 1180 million during fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively a substantial portion of which was derived from fifa ultimate team 

digital delivery of games in our industry players increasingly purchase games digitally as opposed to purchasing physical discs while this trend as applied to our business may not be linear because of product mix during a fiscal year consumer buying patterns and other factors over time we expect players to purchase an increasingly higher proportion of our games digitally therefore we expect net revenue attributable to digital full game downloads to increase over time and net revenue attributable to sales of packaged goods to decrease our net revenue attributable to digital full game downloads was 809 million 680 million and 707 million during fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively while our net revenue attributable to packaged goods sales decreased from 1700 million in fiscal year 2018 to 1240 million in fiscal year 2019 and 1223 million in fiscal year 2020 in addition as measured based on total units sold on microsoft’s xbox one and sony’s playstation 4 rather than by net revenue we estimate that 49 percent 49 percent and 39 percent of our total units sold during fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 were sold digitally digital full game units are based on sales information provided by microsoft and sony packaged goods units sold through are estimated by obtaining data from significant retail partners in north america europe and asia and applying internal sales estimates with respect to retail partners from which we do not obtain data we believe that these percentages are reasonable estimates of the proportion of our games that are digitally downloaded in relation to our total number of units sold for the applicable period of measurement we expect the longterm trends in revenue and in the percentage of games digitally downloaded to continue increases in consumer adoption of digital purchase of games combined with increases in our live services revenue generally results in expansion of our gross margin as costs associated with selling a game digitally is generally less than selling the same game through traditional retail and distribution channels 

freetoplay games the global adoption of mobile devices and a business model for those devices that allows consumers to try new games with no upfront cost and that are monetized through a live service associated with the game particularly extra content sales has led to significant sales growth in the mobile gaming industry similarly sales of extra content are the primary driver of our mobile business we expect the mobile gaming industry to continue to grow during our 2021 fiscal year likewise 

the consumer acceptance of freetoplay live servicebased online pc games has broadened our consumer base and has begun to expand into the console market for example within our business we offer apex legends as a freetoplay live servicebased pc and console game we expect extra content revenue generated from mobile pc and console freetoplay games to remain an important part of our business 

concentration of sales among the most popular games  in all major segments of our industry we see a large portion of games sales concentrated on the most popular titles similarly a significant portion of our revenue historically has been derived from games based on a few popular franchises several of which we have released on an annual or biannual basis in particular we have historically derived a significant portion of our net revenue from our largest and most popular game fifa the annualized version of which is consistently one of the bestselling games in the marketplace 

recurring revenue sources our business model includes revenue that we deem recurring in nature such as revenue from our annualized sports franchises eg fifa madden nfl our console pc and mobile catalog titles ie titles that did not launch in the current fiscal year and our live services we have been able to forecast revenue from these areas of our business with greater relative confidence than for new games services and business models as we continue to incorporate new business models and modalities of play into our games our goal is to continue to look for opportunities to expand the recurring portion of our business 

net bookings  in order to improve transparency into our business we disclose an operating performance metric net bookings net bookings is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or soldin physically in the period net bookings is calculated by adding total net revenue to the change in deferred net revenue for onlineenabled games and platform fees 

the following is a calculation of our total net bookings for the periods presented 



net bookings were 5211 million for fiscal year 2020 driven by sales related to fifa 20 madden nfl 20 and star wars jedi fallen order  net bookings increased 267 million or 5 percent as compared to fiscal year 2019 due primarily to star wars jedi fallen order apex legends and need for speed heat  partially offset by battlefield v and anthem digital net bookings were 4052 million for fiscal year 2020 an increase of 330 million or 9 percent as compared to fiscal year 2019 the increase in digital net bookings was primarily driven by our live services which grew 372 million or 15 percent yearoveryear primarily due to sales of extra content for apex legends fifa ultimate team and madden ultimate team and full game downloads which grew 18 million or 2 percent due to net bookings associated with star wars jedi fallen order and need for speed heat partially offset by battlefield v  these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 60 million or 10 percent in our mobile business due to declines from aging titles 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities contingent assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the recent outbreak of covid19 as a result actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

for a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates with respect to revenue recognition for revenue transactions occurring prior to april 1 2018 which were accounted for under asc 605 revenue recognition the “old revenue standard” or “asc 605” refer to part ii item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations ” under the subheading critical accounting policies and estimates included in our annual report on form 10k for our fiscal year ended march 31 2018 filed with the sec on may 23 2018 with respect to revenue transactions occurring on april 1 2018 and onward our revenue recognition accounting policy is set forth below and follows asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers the “new revenue standard” or “asc 606”  

revenue recognition 

we derive revenue principally from sales of our games and related extra content and services that can be played on game consoles pcs mobile phones and tablets our product and service offerings include but are not limited to the following 

• full games with both online and offline functionality “games with services” which generally includes 1 the initial game delivered digitally or via physical disc at the time of sale and typically provide access to offline core game content “software license” 2 updates on a whenandifavailable basis such as software patches or updates andor additional free content to be delivered in the future “future update rights” and 3 a hosted connection for online playability “online hosting” 

• full games with onlineonly functionality which require an internet connection to access all gameplay and functionality “onlinehosted service games” 

• extra content related to games with services and onlinehosted service games which provides access to additional ingame content 

• subscriptions such as origin access origin access premier and ea access that generally offers access to a selection of full games ingame content online services and other benefits typically for a recurring monthly or annual fee and 

• licensing to third parties to distribute and host our games and content 

we evaluate and recognize revenue by 

• identifying the contracts with the customer 

• identifying the performance obligations in the contract 

• determining the transaction price 

• allocating the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract and 

• recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied through the transfer of a promised good or service to a customer ie “transfer of control” 

certain of our full game andor extra content are sold to resellers with a contingency that the full game andor extra content cannot be resold prior to a specific date “street date contingency” we recognize revenue for transactions that have a street date contingency when the street date contingency is removed and the full game andor extra content can be resold by the reseller for digital full game andor extra content downloads sold to customers we recognize revenue when the full game andor extra content is made available for download to the customer 

onlineenabled games 

games with services our sales of games with services are evaluated to determine whether the software license future update rights and the online hosting are distinct and separable sales of games with services are generally determined to have three distinct performance obligations software license future update rights and the online hosting 

since we do not sell the performance obligations on a standalone basis we consider market conditions and other observable inputs to estimate the standalone selling price for each performance obligation for games with services generally 75 percent of the sales price is allocated to the software license performance obligation and recognized at a point in time when control of the license has been transferred to the customer which is usually at or near the same time as the booking of the transaction the remaining 25 percent is allocated to the future update rights and the online hosting performance obligations and recognized ratably as the service is provided over the estimated offering period 

onlinehosted service games sales of our onlinehosted service games are determined to have one distinct performance obligation the online hosting we recognize revenue from these arrangements as the service is provided 

extra content revenue received from sales of downloadable content are derived primarily from the sale of virtual currencies and digital ingame content that enhance players’ game experience sales of extra content are accounted for in a manner consistent with the treatment for our games with services and onlinehosted service games as discussed above depending upon whether or not the extra content has offline functionality that is if the extra content has offline functionality then the extra content is accounted for similarly to games with services generally determined to have three distinct performance obligations software license future update rights and the online hosting if the extra content does not have offline functionality then the extra content is determined to have one distinct performance obligation the onlinehosted service offering 

subscriptions 

sales of our subscriptions are deemed to be one performance obligation and we recognize revenue from these arrangements ratably over the subscription term as the performance obligation is satisfied 

licensing revenue 

in certain countries we utilize thirdparty licensees to distribute and host our games and content in accordance with license agreements for which the licensees typically pay us a fixed minimum guarantee andor salesbased royalties these arrangements typically include multiple performance obligations such as a timebased license of software and future update rights we recognize as revenue a portion of the minimum guarantee when we transfer control of the license of software generally upon commercial launch and the remaining portion ratably over the contractual term in which we provide the licensee with future update rights any salesbased royalties are generally recognized as the related sales occur by the licensee 

significant judgments around revenue arrangements 

identifying performance obligations performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct ie the customer can benefit from the goods or services either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and are distinct in the context of the contract ie it is separately identifiable from other goods or services in the contract to the extent a contract includes multiple promises we must apply judgment to determine whether those promises are separate and distinct performance obligations if these criteria are not met the promises are accounted for as a combined performance obligation 

determining the transaction price the transaction price is determined based on the consideration that we will be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring our goods and services to the customer determining the transaction price often requires judgment based on an assessment of contractual terms and business practices it further includes review of variable consideration such as discounts sales returns price protection and rebates which is estimated at the time of the transaction in addition the transaction price does not include an estimate of the variable consideration related to salesbased royalties salesbased royalties are recognized as the sales occur 

allocating the transaction price allocating the transaction price requires that we determine an estimate of the relative standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation determining the relative standalone selling price is inherently subjective especially in situations where we do not sell the performance obligation on a standalone basis which occurs in the majority of our transactions in those situations we determine the relative standalone selling price based on various observable inputs using all information that is reasonably available examples of observable inputs and information include historical internal pricing data cost plus margin analyses thirdparty external pricing of similar or same products and services such as software licenses and maintenance support within the enterprise software industry the results of our analysis resulted in a specific percentage of the transaction price being allocated to each performance obligation 

determining the estimated offering period the offering period is the period in which we offer to provide the future update rights andor online hosting for the game and related extra content sold because the offering period is not an explicitly defined period we must make an estimate of the offering period for the service related performance obligations ie future update rights and online hosting determining the estimated offering period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision generally we consider the average period of time customers are online when estimating the offering period we also consider the estimated period of time between the date a game unit is sold to a reseller and the date the reseller sells the game unit to the customer ie time in channel based on these two factors we then consider the method of distribution for example games 

sold at retail would have a composite offering period equal to the online gameplay period plus time in channel as opposed to digitallydistributed software licenses which are delivered immediately via digital download and therefore the offering period is estimated to be only the online gameplay period 

additionally we consider results from prior analyses known and expected online gameplay trends as well as disclosed service periods for competitors’ games in determining the estimated offering period for future sales we believe this provides a reasonable depiction of the transfer of future update rights and online hosting to our customers as it is the best representation of the time period during which our games are played we recognize revenue for future update rights and online hosting performance obligations ratably on a straightline basis over this period as there is a consistent pattern of delivery for these performance obligations these performance obligations are generally recognized over an estimated ninemonth period beginning in the month after shipment for software licenses sold through retail and an estimated sixmonth period for digitallydistributed software licenses beginning in the month of sale 

principal agent considerations 

we evaluate sales to end customers of our full games and related content via thirdparty storefronts including digital storefronts such as microsoft’s xbox store sony’s playstation store apple app store and google play store in order to determine whether or not we are acting as the principal in the sale to the end customer which we consider in determining if revenue should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the thirdparty storefront an entity is the principal if it controls a good or service before it is transferred to the end customer key indicators that we evaluate in determining gross versus net treatment include but are not limited to the following 

• the underlying contract terms and conditions between the various parties to the transaction 

• which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service to the end customer 

• which party has inventory risk before the specified good or service has been transferred to the end customer and 

• which party has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service 

based on an evaluation of the above indicators except as discussed below we have determined that generally the third party is considered the principal to end customers for the sale of our full games and related content we therefore report revenue related to these arrangements net of the fees retained by the storefront however for sales arrangements via apple app store and google play store ea is considered the principal to the end customer and thus we report revenue on a gross basis and mobile platform fees are reported within cost of revenue 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both 1 the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and 2 the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carryforwards we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified it is generally difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is significant negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years forecasts of future taxable income are considered to be less objective than past results therefore cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 

in addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities the carryback of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law and the implementation of tax planning strategies evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence and this evaluation may involve assumptions about future activity certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets 

every quarter we perform a realizability analysis to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized as of march 31 2020 we have recognized a 131 million valuation allowance related to our swiss deferred tax assets our swiss deferred tax asset realizability analysis relies upon future swiss taxable income as the primary source of taxable income but considers all available sources of swiss income based on the positive and negative evidence we give more weight to evidence that can be objectively verified however there is significant judgment involved in estimating future swiss taxable income over the 20year period over which the swiss deferred tax assets will reverse specifically related to assumptions about expected growth rates of future swiss taxable income which are based primarily on 

third party market and industry growth data actual results that differ materially from those estimates could have a material impact on our valuation allowance assessment although objectively verifiable swiss interest rates have an impact on the valuation allowance and are based on published swiss guidance any significant changes to such interest rates could result in a material impact to the valuation allowance switzerland has a sevenyear carryforward period and does not permit the carry back of losses we do not recognize any deferred taxes related to the us taxes on foreign earnings as we recognize these taxes as a period cost 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate these estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation as well as with respect to other matters such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities the ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations in addition changes in our business including acquisitions changes in our international corporate structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix and amount of income as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities valuation allowances applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective tax rate

cost of revenue 

cost of revenue increased by 47 million or 4 percent during fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 this increase was primarily due to an increase in inventory and royalty costs associated with star wars jedi fallen order an increase in royalty costs driven by higher sales associated with madden franchise a higher royalty rate associated with the fifa franchise and data center bandwidth and server usage costs associated with apex legends  partially offset by a decrease in inventory costs associated with battlefield v and the fifa franchise and data center bandwidth and server usage costs associated with anthem  which launched as onlineonly title during fiscal year 2019 

cost of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue decreased by 2 percent during fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 this decrease was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of our digital net revenues to packaged goods and other net revenues which generally have higher costs than our digital games 

research and development 

research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred by our production studios for personnelrelated costs related overhead costs external thirdparty development costs contracted services depreciation and any impairment of prepaid royalties for prelaunch products research and development expenses for our online products include expenses incurred by our studios consisting of direct development and related overhead costs in connection with the development and production of our online games research and development expenses also include expenses associated with our digital platform software licenses and maintenance and management overhead 

research and development expenses for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were as follows in millions 



research and development expenses increased by 126 million or 9 percent in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 this increase was primarily due to a 67 million increase in personnelrelated costs resulting from an increase in variable 

compensation and related expenses a 45 million increase in stockbased compensation and an 18 million increase in thirdparty development expense 

marketing and sales 

marketing and sales expenses consist of personnelrelated costs related overhead costs advertising marketing and promotional expenses net of qualified advertising cost reimbursements from third parties 

marketing and sales expenses for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were as follows in millions 



marketing and sales expenses decreased by 71 million or 10 percent in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 this decrease was primarily due to a 66 million decrease in advertising and promotional spending resulting from fewer frontline title launches in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019

general and administrative expenses for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were as follows in millions 



general and administrative expenses increased by 46 million or 10 percent in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 this increase was primarily due to a 24 million increase in personnelrelated costs driven by an increase in variable compensation and related expenses and a 14 million increase in stockbased compensation 

income taxes 

provision for benefit from income taxes for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 was as follows in millions 



our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 was negative 1015 percent as compared to 56 percent for the same period in fiscal year 2019 during the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 we completed an intraentity sale of some of our intellectual property rights to our swiss subsidiary where our international business is headquartered the “swiss intraentity sale” the transaction did not result in a taxable gain under us gaap any profit resulting from this intercompany transaction will be eliminated upon consolidation however the transaction resulted in a stepup of the swiss taxdeductible basis in the transferred intellectual property rights and accordingly created a temporary difference between the book basis and the tax basis of such intellectual property rights the “swiss deferred tax asset” our effective tax rate and resulting provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 were significantly impacted by our recognition of the swiss deferred tax asset related to the swiss intraentity sale 

during the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 we recognized a 1840 billion swiss deferred tax asset which is net of the impact of a 131 million valuation allowance and a 393 million reduction due to the impact of the decision of the ninth circuit court of appeals in altera corp v commissioner “the altera opinion” the altera opinion also requires related parties in an intercompany costsharing arrangement to share stockbased compensation expenses the altera opinion resulted in the recognition of a onetime charge of 80 million related to prior period us uncertain tax positions during the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 in total during the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 we recognized total onetime tax benefits of 

1760 billion related to the 1840 billion swiss deferred tax asset partially offset by the 80 million onetime altera opinion charge 

excluding the impacts of the swiss deferred tax asset and altera opinion our effective tax rate for the year ended march 31 2020 would have been 150 percent which was higher than the same periods in fiscal year 2019 primarily due to an increase in us taxes on foreign earnings in fiscal year 2020 

our effective tax rates for fiscal year 2021 and future periods will continue to depend on a variety of factors including changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions our corporate structure the geographic location of business functions or assets the geographic mix of income our agreements with tax authorities applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in our annual pretax income or loss we anticipate that the impact of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies may result in significant fluctuations to our effective tax rate in the future

changes in cash flow 

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by 250 million during fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 primarily driven by business performance related to the sales of star wars jedi fallen order need for speed heat and apex legends and improved collections during fiscal year 2020 the increase was partially offset by larger marketing and advertising payments for new titles particularly apex legends and anthem  higher cash payments for income taxes and higher royalty payments 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased by 1526 million during fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 primarily driven by a 2017 million increase in purchases of shortterm investments the increase was partially offset by a 454 million increase in proceeds from sales and maturities of shortterm investments during fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 and the payment of 58 million in connection with mergers and acquisitions activity during fiscal year 2019 

financing activities net cash used in financing activities increased by 105 million during fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 primarily driven by the payment of 122 million of contingent consideration in connection with our acquisition of respawn entertainment llc and a 15 million increase in the repurchase and retirement of our common stock these increases were partially offset by a 31 million decrease in cash paid to taxing authorities in connection with withholding taxes for stockbased compensation 

shortterm investments 

due to our mix of fixed and variable rate securities our shortterm investment portfolio is susceptible to changes in shortterm interest rates as of march 31 2020 our shortterm investments had gross unrealized losses of 8 million or less than 1 percent of the total in shortterm investments and gross unrealized gains of 5 million or less than 1 percent of the total in shortterm investments from time to time we may liquidate some or all of our shortterm investments to fund operational needs or other activities such as capital expenditures business acquisitions or stock repurchase programs 

senior notes 

in february 2016 we issued 600 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 notes and 400 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 notes the effective interest rate is 394 for the 2021 notes and 497 for the 2026 notes interest is payable semiannually in arrears on march 1 and september 1 of each year the 2021 notes are due on march 1 2021 see note 1 1 — financing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as it relates to our senior notes which is incorporated by reference into this item 7 

credit facility 

on august 29 2019 we entered into a 500 million unsecured revolving credit facility “credit facility” with a syndicate of banks the credit facility terminates on august 29 2024 unless the maturity is extended in accordance with its terms as of march 31 2020 no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility see note 1 1 — financing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as it relates to our credit facility which is incorporated by reference into this item 7 

financial condition 

we believe that our cash cash equivalents shortterm investments cash generated from operations and available financing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next 12 months including working capital requirements capital expenditures debt repayment obligations and potentially future acquisitions stock repurchases or strategic investments we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to repay debt strengthen our financial position facilitate expansion repurchase our stock pursue strategic acquisitions and investments andor to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise the covid19 pandemic has caused disruption to capital markets and any additional capital could be difficult to obtain expensive andor not available to us on favorable terms if at all such additional capital could also result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 

our foreign subsidiaries will generally be subject to us tax and to the extent earnings from these subsidiaries can be repatriated without a material tax cost such earnings will not be indefinitely reinvested as of march 31 2020 approximately 44 billion of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions of which approximately 27 billion is available for repatriation without a material tax cost 

we have a “shelf” registration statement on form s3 on file with the sec this shelf registration statement which includes a base prospectus allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus we would use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes which may include funding for working capital financing capital expenditures research and development marketing and distribution efforts and if opportunities arise for acquisitions or strategic alliances pending such uses we may invest the net proceeds in interestbearing securities in addition we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time 

our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those related to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business and on the business of our key partners customer demand and acceptance of our products our ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due successfully achieving our product release schedules and attaining our forecasted sales objectives economic conditions in the united states and abroad the impact of acquisitions and other strategic transactions in which we may engage the impact of competition the seasonal and cyclical nature of our business and operating results and the other risks described in the “ risk factors ” section included in part i item 1a of this report

see note 13 — commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as it relates to our contractual obligations and commercial commitments which is incorporated by reference into this item 7 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of march 31 2020 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk promulgated by the sec that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues and expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 

inflation 

we believe the impact of inflation on our results of operations has not been significant in any of the past three fiscal years 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market prices which have experienced significant volatility including increased volatility in connection with the covid19 pandemic market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below while we do not hedge our shortterm investment portfolio we protect our shortterm investment portfolio against different market risks including interest rate risk as discussed below our cash and cash equivalents portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for speculative trading purposes and do not hedge our market price risk relating to marketable equity securities if any 

foreign currency exchange risk 

foreign currency exchange rates international sales are a fundamental part of our business and the strengthening of the us dollar particularly relative to the euro british pound sterling australian dollar chinese yuan south korean won and polish zloty has a negative impact on our reported international net revenue but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses particularly the swedish krona and canadian dollar because these amounts are translated at lower rates as compared to periods in which the us dollar is weaker while we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risk these activities are limited in the protection that they provide us and can themselves result in losses 

cash flow hedging activities we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreigncurrencydenominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing foreign currency forward contracts that generally have maturities of 18 months or less these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements in net revenue and research and development expenses 

balance sheet hedging activities  we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk associated with foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily intercompany receivables and payables these foreign currency forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three months or less and are transacted near monthend 

we believe the counterparties to our foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations as of march 31 2020 a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 20 percent would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value on our foreign currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging of 160 million or 320 million respectively as of march 31 2020 a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 20 percent would have resulted in potential losses in the consolidated statements of operations on our foreign currency forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of 65 million or 130 million respectively this sensitivity analysis assumes an adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates however all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in the same manner and actual results may differ materially see note 5 — derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as it relates to our derivative financial instruments which is incorporated by reference into this item 7a 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities however because shortterm investments mature relatively quickly and if reinvested are invested at the thencurrent market rates interest income on a portfolio consisting of shortterm investments is subject to market fluctuations to a greater extent than a portfolio of longer term investments additionally the contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to call prepay or otherwise settle the investments at prices less than the stated par value our investments are held for purposes other than trading we do not use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio 

as of march 31 2020 our shortterm investments were classified as availableforsale securities and consequently were recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax in stockholders’ equity 

notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our shortterm investment portfolio to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our shortterm investment portfolio we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the portfolio assuming a 150 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve as of march 31 2020 a hypothetical 150 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a 24 million or 1 decrease in the fair market value of our shortterm investments

not applicable 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

definition and limitations of disclosure controls 

our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the exchange act such as this report is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our management evaluates these controls and procedures on an ongoing basis 

there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures these limitations include the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures and reasonable resource constraints in addition because we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions which we believe are reasonable about the likelihood of future events our system of controls may not achieve its desired purpose under all possible future conditions accordingly our disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance but not absolute assurance of achieving their objectives 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures believe that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing the requisite reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act 

our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting these limitations include the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of the system and reasonable resource constraints because of its inherent limitations our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate 

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our most recently completed fiscal year in making its assessment management used the criteria set forth in internal controlintegrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment our management believes that as of the end of our most recently completed fiscal year our internal control over financial reporting was effective 

kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an auditors’ report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that report appears on page 81 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended march 31 2020 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

we are a global leader in digital interactive entertainment with a mission to inspire the world to play we develop market publish and distribute games content and services that can be played and watched on a variety of platforms including game consoles pcs mobile phones and tablets 

our strategic pillars 

there are three core pillars to our strategy 

• players first 

• commitment to digital 

• one ea 

these strategic pillars are built on our focus of delivering a broad and deep portfolio of games and services that engages players across a wide range of geographies platforms and business models 

players first 

players are the foundation of our success and we are committed to thinking about players first in everything we do our goal is to build deep ongoing and meaningful relationships with our players we aim to build these relationships by creating amazing games and services that deliver longlasting fun and enduring value by connecting with our players across platforms and social channels and by delivering flexibility and innovation in our business models in fiscal year 2019 we continued to innovate for players by including frontline titles in our origin access premier subscription service publishing our first freetoplay console game apex legends  and investing in more ways to reach our players such as cloud gaming and esports 

our games and services are based on a portfolio of intellectual property that includes established brands such as fifa madden nfl star wars battlefield the sims and need for speed we also have invested and will continue to invest in developing and establishing new brands and in fiscal year 2019 launched two new intellectual properties – anthem and apex legends  we will continue to develop and publish a broad and deep portfolio of games and services that engage players across geographies platforms and business models 

commitment to digital 

players increasingly purchase our games as digital downloads as opposed to purchasing physical discs and engage with the live services that we provide on an ongoing basis our live services provide additional depth and engagement opportunities for our players and include ingame purchases extra content subscriptions and esports for example the ultimate team  mode associated with our sports franchises and live services provided for our battlefield star wars and sims franchises have extended the life of those games by engaging players over longer periods of time the digital transformation also is creating opportunities in platforms content models and the way in which players engage with our games and services for example we 

have leveraged brands and assets from franchises historically associated with traditional gaming such as fifa madden nfl star wars the sims and simcity to create freetoplay games that are monetized through live services provided with the game we also offer subscription services such as ea access origin access and origin access premier as we look to build deeper relationships with our players and offer increased choice and flexibility for our players to try new games 

  

the portion of our revenue attributable to our digital business has significantly increased from 59 percent in fiscal year 2017 to 67 percent in fiscal year 2018 and 75 percent during fiscal year 2019 we believe that our digital revenue which generally has a higher gross margin than our packaged goods revenue will continue to increase during fiscal year 2020 relative to packaged goods revenue as we continue to focus on developing and monetizing products and services that can be delivered digitally 

one ea 

as a global leader in digital interactive entertainment we have an opportunity to leverage our scale to market and deliver engaging games and services to more players across more platforms our “one ea” model provides strategic advantages for example we have moved much of our pc and console development to one game engine this creates operational flexibility as our development teams code on a consistent engine and will allow us to transition our products and services to new platforms quickly and costeffectively in addition we’ve brought together our marketing publishing and analytics functions as a single gotomarket unit and simplified their processes and decisionmaking in order to improve effectiveness and build flexibility into our marketing strategies 

we also are strengthening the technology that connects our players to each other and to the games they love we are adopting consistent crosscompany methodologies to better understand our players’ needs and continue to invest in technological infrastructure that enables us to deliver content that will resonate with players and provide more choice in the way that players connect with their games with each other and with new types of content including esports broadcasts this connection also allows us to market and deliver content and services for popular franchises like fifa battlefield and star wars to our players more efficiently 

our games and services 

we develop market publish and deliver games and services that can be played and watched on a variety of platforms including consoles pcs mobile phones and tablets we market and sell our games and services through digital distribution channels and through retail channels we believe that flexibility across platforms distribution channels and business models maximizes the opportunity for players to access and enjoy our games and services and increases engagement with our games and services new platforms engagement models and business models are expected to continue to emerge in the future and we intend to evaluate these opportunities on a casebycase basis 

digitally our console games and services can be purchased through thirdparty storefronts such as the digital stores of our console platform partners sony microsoft and nintendo our direct sales to sony and microsoft represented approximately 29 percent  and 16 percent  of total net revenue respectively in fiscal year 2019 approximately 27 percent and 16 percent of total net revenue respectively in fiscal year 2018 and approximately 19 percent and 17 percent of total net revenue respectively in fiscal year 2017 our mobile and tablet games and services are available through thirdparty application storefronts such as the apple app store and google play our pc games and services can be downloaded directly through our origin platform as well as through thirdparty online download stores we also partner with third parties to publish our mobile and pc games and services on their platforms in certain asian territories such as our partnerships with tencent holdings limited and nexon co ltd for fifa online  in china and korea respectively players also can access a selection of our console and pc games and services through our ea access origin access and origin access premier subscription services our packaged goods games are sold directly to mass market retailers electronics specialty stores and game software specialty stores or through distribution arrangements 

in our games and services we use brands that we either wholly own such as battlefield the sims apex legends anthem need for speed and plants v zombies or license from others such as fifa madden nfl and star wars we develop and publish games and services   across diverse genres such as sports firstperson shooter action roleplaying and simulation and offer our games and services through diverse business models and distribution channels such as retail download subscription and freetoplay  we believe that the breadth and depth of our portfolio and our flexibility in business models and distribution channels provide us with strategic advantages these advantages include the opportunity to engage an increasing number of players across more platforms and geographies and a recurring source of revenue from among other things our annualized sports franchises eg fifa madden nfl our console pc and mobile catalog titles ie titles that did not launch in the current fiscal year the associated live services and our subscriptions business 

our largest and most popular game is fifa the annualized version of which is consistently one of the bestselling games in the marketplace net revenue from  fifa 19   fifa 18    and fifa 17  represented approximately 14 percent of our total net revenue in fiscal year 2019 and approximately 11 percent of our total net revenue in each of fiscal year 2018 and 2017 

within and alongside our games we offer live services including ingame purchases downloadable content and esports that provide additional depth and engagement opportunities for our players our live services net revenue comprised 45 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2019 and we expect that live services net revenue will continue to be material to our business our most popular live service is the  ultimate team  mode associated with our sports franchises  ultimate team  allows players to collect current and former professional players in order to build and compete as a personalized team net revenue from ultimate team represented approximately 28 percent 21 percent and 16 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively a substantial portion of which was derived from fifa ultimate team  

we also are investing in a number of longterm initiatives that we believe will allow us to better serve and deepen our engagement with our players for example we focus on esports through our competitive gaming division we believe that the interest and enthusiasm that surrounds esports will drive engagement and monetization in our live services in addition to providing revenue through partnerships with sponsors and broadcasters in addition we are pursuing technology underlying cloud gaming and subscriptions which we see as future growth opportunities 

significant relationships 

sony  microsoft  under the terms of agreements we have entered into with sony computer entertainment inc and its affiliates and with microsoft corporation and its affiliates we are authorized to develop and distribute discbased and digitallydelivered software products and services compatible with playstation and xbox consoles respectively under these agreements with sony and microsoft we are provided with the nonexclusive right to use for a fixed term and in a designated territory technology that is owned or licensed by them to publish our games on their respective platform with respect to our digitallydelivered products and services the console manufacturers pay us either a wholesale price or a “royalty” percentage on the revenue they derive from their sales of our products and services our transactions for packaged goods products are made pursuant to individual purchase orders which are accepted on a caseby case basis by sony or microsoft or their designated replicators as the case may be for packaged goods products we pay the console manufacturers a perunit royalty for each unit manufactured many key commercial terms of our relationships with sony and microsoft — such as manufacturing terms delivery times platform policies and approval conditions — are determined unilaterally and are subject to change by the console manufacturers 

the platform license agreements also require us to indemnify the console manufacturers for any loss liability and expense resulting from any claim against the console manufacturer regarding our games and services including any claims for patent copyright or trademark infringement brought against the console manufacturer each platform license may be terminated by the console manufacturer if a breach or default by us is not cured after we receive written notice from the console manufacturer or if we become insolvent the console manufacturers are not obligated to enter into platform license agreements with us for any future consoles products or services 

apple google and other app stores  we have agreements to distribute our mobile applications and additional content through distributors such as apple and google our applications are downloaded for mobile devices from third party application storefronts the distributor charges consumers for content purchased within the application or charges consumers a onetime fee to download the application our distribution agreements establish the amounts that are retained by the distributor and the amounts passed through to us these arrangements are typically terminable on short notice the agreements generally do not obligate the distributors to market or distribute any of our applications 

publishing partners in asia  we have entered into agreements whereby we partner with certain companies including tencent holdings limited and nexon co ltd or their respective affiliates pursuant to which these companies publish our mobile and pc freetodownload games in certain asian territories including china and korea our players access games from the publishers’ platforms and are charged for additional content purchased within our game environment the agreements generally establish the amounts that are retained by the publisher and the amounts passed through to us 

competition 

the market for interactive entertainment is intensely competitive and changes rapidly as new products platforms business models and distribution channels are introduced we also face competition for the right to use certain intellectual property included in our products we face significant competition from companies such as activision blizzard taketwo interactive 

ubisoft bethesda epic games netease tencent sony microsoft and nintendo primarily with respect to developing games and services that operate on consoles pcs andor mobile devices 

more broadly we compete against providers of different sources of entertainment such as motion pictures television social networking online casual entertainment and music that our players could enjoy in their free time important competitive factors in our industry include game quality and ease of use innovation compatibility of products with certain platforms brand recognition publisher reputation reliability security creativity price marketing and quality of customer service 

intellectual property 

to establish and protect our intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyrights trademarks patents patent applications trade secrets knowhow license agreements confidentiality provisions and procedures and other contractual provisions we actively engage in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property we also devote financial and operational resources to implement systems processes and technologies to guard against cyber events and to help protect our intellectual property employee and consumer data and information technology systems against intrusions or other security breaches in addition we engage in activities designed to limit the impact of abuse of our digital products and services including monitoring our games for evidence of exploitation and rebalancing our game environments in the event that such abuse is discovered 

governmental regulation 

we are a global company subject to various and complex laws and regulations domestically and internationally including laws and regulations related to user privacy data collection and retention consumer protection content advertising localization information security intellectual property competition and taxation among others many of these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing and the application to and impact on us is uncertain certain of our business models in particular are subject to new laws or regulations or evolving interpretations and application of existing laws and regulations for example the growth and development of electronic commerce virtual items and virtual currency have prompted calls for new laws and regulations or the application of existing laws or regulations to these business models 

seasonality 

we have historically experienced the highest percentage of our net bookings in our third fiscal quarter due to seasonal holiday demand and the launch timing of our games while we expect this trend to continue in fiscal year 2020 there is no assurance that it will in addition we defer the recognition of a portion of our net revenue over an extended period of time as a result the quarter in which we generate the highest net bookings may be different from the quarter in which we recognized the highest amount of net revenue 

employees 

as of march 31 2019 we had approximately 9700 regular fulltime employees over 6000 of whom were outside the united states we believe that our ability to attract train motivate and retain qualified employees is a critical factor in the successful development of our products and services and that our future success will depend in large measure on our ability to continue attracting training motivating and retaining qualified employees approximately 8 percent of our employees all of whom work for our dice development studio in sweden are represented by a union

risk factors 

tableend 

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs our business or financial performance could be harmed our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe could be material that may harm our business or financial performance 

our business is intensely competitive and “hit” driven we may not deliver “hit” products and services or consumers may prefer our competitors’ products or services over our own 

competition in our industry is intense many new products and services are regularly introduced in each major industry segment console mobile and pc but only a relatively small number of “hit” titles account for a significant portion of total revenue in each segment our competitors range from established interactive entertainment companies and diversified media companies to emerging startups and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge throughout the world if our competitors develop and market more successful and engaging products or services offer competitive products or services at lower price points or if we do not continue to develop consistently highquality wellreceived and engaging products and services our revenue margins and profitability will decline 

we maintain a relatively limited product portfolio in an effort to focus on developing highquality and engaging products and services with the potential to become hits highquality titles even if highlyreviewed may not turn into a hit many hit products and services within our industry are iterations of prior hits with large established consumer bases and significant brand recognition which makes competing in certain categories challenging in addition hit products or services of our direct competitors or other entertainment companies may take a larger portion of consumer spending or time than we anticipate which could cause our products and services to underperform relative to our expectations publishing a relatively small number of major titles each year also concentrates risk in those titles and means each major title has greater associated risk a significant portion of our revenue historically has been derived from products and services based on a few popular franchises and the underperformance of a single major title could have a material adverse impact on our financial results for example we have historically derived a significant portion of our net revenue from sales related to our largest and most popular game fifa the annualized version of which is consistently one of the bestselling games in the marketplace any events or circumstances that negatively impact our fifa franchise such as product or service quality competing products that take a portion of consumer spending and time the delay or cancellation of a product or service launch or real or perceived security risks could negatively impact our financial results to a disproportionate extent 

the increased importance of live services revenue to our business heightens the risks associated with our limited product portfolio live services that are either poorlyreceived or provided in connection with underperforming games may generate lower than expected sales any lapse delay or failure in our ability to provide highquality live services content to consumers over an extended period of time could materially and adversely affect our financial results consumer engagement with our live services and cause harm to our reputation and brand our most popular live service is the ultimate team mode associated with our sports franchises any events or circumstances that negatively impact our ability to reliably provide content or sustain engagement for ultimate team  particularly fifa ultimate team  would negatively impact our financial results to a disproportionate extent 

our industry changes rapidly and we may fail to anticipate or   successfully implement new or evolving technologies or adopt successful business strategies distribution methods or services 

rapid changes in our industry require us to anticipate sometimes years in advance the ways in which our products and services will be competitive in the market we have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies technologies distribution methods products and services there can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns for example we are investing in the technological infrastructure that we expect will enable us to deliver content that will resonate with players and provide more choice in the way that players connect with their games with each other and with new types of content we also recently expanded our freetoplay business model by launching our first freetoplay console game such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the technology we choose to implement the business strategies we choose to adopt and the products and services that we pursue will be successful if we do not successfully evolve our business in a manner that meets or exceeds player expectations our reputation and brand may be materially adversely affected and our financial condition and operating results may be impacted we also may miss opportunities to adopt technology or distribution methods or develop products services or new ways to engage with our games that become popular with consumers which could adversely affect our financial results it may take significant time and resources to shift our focus to alternatives putting us at a competitive disadvantage 

our development process usually starts with particular platforms and distribution methods in mind and a range of technical development feature and ongoing goals that we hope to be able to achieve we may not be able to achieve these goals or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly and in a way that better engages consumers in either case our products and services may be technologically inferior to those of our competitors less appealing to consumers or both if we cannot achieve our goals within the original development schedule for our products and services then we may delay their release until these goals can be achieved which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses alternatively we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies either to preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up with our competition which would increase our development expenses 

we may experience security breaches and cyber threats 

our industry is prone to and our systems and networks are subject to cyberattacks computer viruses worms phishing attacks malicious software programs and other information security incidents that seek to exploit disable damage disrupt or gain access to our networks our products and services supporting technological infrastructure intellectual property and other assets we expect these threats to our systems and networks to continue in addition we rely on technological infrastructure provided by thirdparty business partners to support the online functionality of our products and services these business partners as well as our channel partners also are subject to cyber risks and threats both our partners and we have expended and expect to continue to expend financial and operational resources to implement certain systems processes and technologies to guard against cyber risks and to help protect our data and systems however the techniques used to exploit disable damage disrupt or gain access to our networks our products and services supporting technological infrastructure intellectual property and other assets change frequently continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and often are not detected for long periods of time our systems processes and technologies and the systems processes and technologies of our business partners may not be adequate against all eventualities the costs to respond to mitigate andor notify affected parties of cyberattacks and other security vulnerabilities are significant any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or cyber risks or detect or respond adequately to a security breach or cyber risk could result in a loss of anticipated revenue interruptions to our products and services cause us to incur significant remediation and notification costs degrade the user experience cause consumers to lose confidence in our products and services and cause us to incur significant legal and financial costs this could harm our business reputation and brand disrupt our relationships with partners and customers and diminish our competitive position 

the virtual economies that we have established in many of our games are subject to abuse exploitation and other forms of fraudulent activity that can negatively impact our business virtual economies involve the use of virtual currency andor virtual assets that can be used or redeemed by a player within a particular game or service the abuse or exploitation of our virtual economies include the illegitimate generation and sale of virtual items including in black markets our online services have been impacted by ingame exploits and the use of automated or other fraudulent processes to generate virtual item or currency illegitimately and such activity may continue these abuses and exploits and the steps that we take to address these abuses and exploits may result in a loss of anticipated revenue increased costs to protect against or remediate these issues interfere with players’ enjoyment of a balanced game environment and cause harm to our reputation and brand 

our business could be adversely affected if our consumer protection data privacy and security practices are not adequate or perceived as being inadequate to prevent data breaches or by the application of consumer protection and data privacy and security laws generally 

in the course of our business we collect process store and use consumer employee and other information including personal information passwords credit card information gameplay details and banking information although we expend and expect to continue to expend financial and operational resources to create and enforce security measures policies and controls that are designed to protect this information from improper or unauthorized access acquisition and misuse andor uninformed disclosure our security measures policies and controls may not be able successful against all eventualities the improper or unauthorized access acquisition or misuse andor uninformed disclosure of consumer and other information or a perception that we do not adequately secure this information or provide consumers with adequate notice about the information that they authorize us to disclose could result in legal liability costly remedial measures governmental and regulatory investigations harm our profitability reputation and brand and cause our financial results to be materially affected in addition third party vendors and business partners receive access to information that we collect these vendors and business partners may not prevent data security breaches with respect to the information we provide them or fully enforce our policies contractual obligations and disclosures regarding the collection use storage transfer and retention of personal data a data security breach of one of our vendors or business partners could cause reputational and financial harm to them and us negatively impact our ability to offer our products and services and 

could result in legal liability costly remedial measures governmental and regulatory investigations harm our profitability reputation and brand and cause our financial results to be materially affected 

we are subject to payment card association rules and obligations pursuant to contracts with payment card processors under these rules and obligations if information is compromised we could be liable to payment card issuers for the cost of associated expenses and penalties in addition if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards even if no consumer information is compromised we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs 

as a global company we are subject to global data privacy data protection localization security and consumerprotection laws and regulations these laws and regulations are emerging and evolving in countries worldwide and the interpretation and application of these laws and regulations in the united states europe and elsewhere often are uncertain contradictory and changing for example the european general data protection regulation gdpr applies to us creating a range of new compliance obligations regarding the treatment of personal data in addition the gdpr contains significant penalties for noncompliance it is possible that these laws may be interpreted or applied in a manner that is adverse to us unforeseen or otherwise inconsistent with our practices or that we may not adequately adapt our internal policies andor procedures to evolving regulations any of which could result in litigation regulatory investigations and potential legal liability require us to change our practices in a manner adverse to our business or limit access to our products and services in certain countries as a result our reputation and brand may be harmed we could incur substantial costs and we could lose both consumers and revenue 

we may experience outages disruptions or degradations in our services products andor technological infrastructure 

the reliable performance of our products and services increasingly depends on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology systems and those of our external service providers including thirdparty “cloud” computing services our games and services are complex software products and maintaining the sophisticated internal and external technological infrastructure required to reliably deliver these games and services is expensive and complex the reliable delivery and stability of our products and services could be adversely impacted by outages disruptions failures or degradations in our network and related infrastructure as well as in the online platforms or services of key business partners who offer support or host our products and services possible causes of these outages disruptions failures or degradations include natural disasters power loss terrorism cyberattacks computer viruses bugs or other malware or ransomware that may harm our systems or the systems of our external business partners in addition the migration of data among data centers and to thirdparty hosted environments and the performance of upgrades and maintenance on our systems could impact the reliability and stability of our products and services if not managed properly 

if we or our external business partners were to experience an event that caused a significant system outage disruption or degradation or if a transition among data centers or service providers or an upgrade or maintenance session encountered unexpected interruptions unforeseen complexity or unplanned disruptions our products and services may not be available to consumers or may not be delivered reliably and stably as a result our reputation and brand may be harmed consumer engagement with our products and services may be reduced and our revenue and profitability could be negatively impacted we do not have redundancy for all our systems many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities 

as our digital business grows we will require an increasing amount of internal and external technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy the needs of consumers we are investing and expect to continue to invest in our own technology hardware and software and the technology hardware and software of external service providers to support our business but it is possible that we may fail to scale effectively and grow this technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands which may adversely affect the reliable and stable performance of our games and services therefore negatively impacting engagement reputation brand and revenue growth 

negative perceptions about and responses to our brands products services andor business practices may damage our business and we may incur costs to address concerns 

expectations regarding the quality performance and integrity of our products and services are high players may be critical of our brands products services business models andor business practices for a wide variety of reasons including perceptions about gameplay fun fairness game content features or services or objections to certain of our business practices these negative responses may not be foreseeable we also may not effectively manage these responses because of reasons within or outside of our control for example we have included in certain games the ability for players to purchase digital items including in some instances virtual “packs” “boxes” or “crates” that contain variable digital items the inclusion of variable digital items in certain of our games has attracted the attention of our community and if the future implementation of these features creates a negative perception of gameplay fairness or other negative perceptions our reputation and brand could be harmed and our revenue could 

be negatively impacted in addition we have taken actions including delaying the release of our games and delaying or discontinuing features and services for our games after taking into consideration among other things feedback from our community even if those decisions negatively impacted our operating results in the short term we expect to continue to take actions to address concerns as appropriate including actions that may result in additional expenditures and the loss of revenue negative sentiment about gameplay fairness our business practices business models or game content also can lead to investigations or increased scrutiny from governmental bodies and consumer groups as well as litigation which regardless of their outcome may be costly damaging to our reputation and harm our business 

our business depends on the success and availability of platforms developed by third parties and our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for those platforms 

the success of our business is driven in part by the commercial success and adequate supply of thirdparty platforms for which we develop our products and services or through which our products and services are distributed our success also depends on our ability to accurately predict which platforms and distribution methods will be successful in the marketplace our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for these platforms our ability to simultaneously manage products and services on multiple platforms and our ability to effectively transition our products and services to new platforms we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of the commercial availability of new platforms and we may incur significant expense to adjust our product portfolio and development efforts in response to changing consumer preferences additionally we may enter into certain exclusive licensing arrangements that affect our ability to deliver or market products or services on certain platforms a platform for which we are developing products and services may not succeed as expected or new platforms may take market share and interactive entertainment consumers away from platforms for which we have devoted significant resources if consumer demand for the platforms for which we are developing products and services is lower than our expectations we may be unable to fully recover the investments we have made in developing our products and services and our financial performance will be harmed alternatively a platform for which we have not devoted significant resources could be more successful than we initially anticipated causing us to not be able to take advantage of meaningful revenue opportunities 

government regulations applicable to us may negatively impact our business 

we are a global company subject to various and complex laws and regulations domestically and internationally including laws and regulations related to consumer protection content advertising localization information security intellectual property competition and taxation among others many of these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing and the application to and impact on us is uncertain these laws could harm our business by limiting the products and services we can offer consumers or the manner in which we offer them the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation any failure on our part to comply with these laws or the application of these laws in an unanticipated manner may harm our business and result in penalties or significant legal liability 

certain of our business models are subject to new laws or regulations or evolving interpretations and application of existing laws and regulations for example the growth and development of electronic commerce virtual items and virtual currency have prompted calls for new laws and regulations or the application of existing laws or regulations that could limit or restrict the sale of our products and services or otherwise impact our products and services in addition we include modes in our games that allow players to compete against each other and manage player competitions that are based on our products and services although we structure and operate our skillbased competitions with applicable laws in mind our skillbased competitions in the future could become subject to evolving laws and regulations new laws related to these business models or changes in the interpretation or application of current laws that impact these business models  each of which could vary significantly across jurisdictions  could subject us to additional regulation and oversight lessen the engagement with and growth of profitable business models and expose us to increased compliance costs significant liability penalties and harm to our reputation and brand 

we are subject to laws in certain foreign countries and adhere to industry standards in the united states that mandate rating requirements or set other restrictions on the advertisement or distribution of interactive entertainment software based on content in addition certain foreign countries allow government censorship of interactive entertainment software products adoption of ratings systems censorship or restrictions on distribution of interactive entertainment software based on content could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our consumers in addition compliance with new and possibly inconsistent regulations for different territories could be costly delay or prevent the release of our products in those territories 

we may not meet our product development schedules or key events sports seasons andor movies that are tied to our product and service release schedule to may be delayed cancelled or poorly received 

our ability to meet product development schedules is affected by a number of factors both within and outside our control including feedback from our players the creative processes involved the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams the complexity of our products and the platforms for which they are developed the need to finetune our products prior to their release and in certain cases approvals from third parties we have experienced development delays for our products in the past which caused us to delay or cancel release dates we also seek to release certain products and significant content for our ongoing live services  such as within our ultimate team live service  in conjunction with key events such as the beginning of a sports season major sporting event or the release of a related movie if such a key event were delayed cancelled or poorly received our sales likely would suffer materially any failure to meet anticipated production or release schedules likely would result in a delay of revenue andor possibly a significant shortfall in our revenue increase our development andor marketing expenses harm our profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different than anticipated 

historically our business has been highly seasonal with the highest percentage of our sales occurring in the quarter ending in december while we expect this trend to continue in fiscal year 2020 there is no assurance that it will be so if we miss key selling periods for products or services for any reason including product delays or product cancellations our sales likely will suffer significantly additionally macroeconomic conditions or the occurrence of unforeseen events that negatively impact consumer or retailer buying patterns particularly during the quarter ending in december likely will harm our financial performance disproportionately 

our marketing and advertising efforts may fail to resonate with consumers 

our products and services are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs such as online and mobile advertising television advertising retail merchandising marketing through websites and streaming services event sponsorship partnerships with influencers and content creators and direct communications with consumers including via email furthermore an increasing portion of our marketing activity is taking place on social media platforms and through streaming networks influencers and content creators that are outside of our direct control our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part upon the success of these programs and changes to consumer preferences actions by influencers or content creators marketing regulations technology changes or service disruptions may negatively impact our ability to reach our customers or otherwise negatively impact our marketing campaigns or the franchises associated with those marketing campaigns moreover if the marketing for our products and services is not innovative agile or fails to resonate with our customers particularly during the critical holiday season or during other key selling periods or if advertising rates or other media placement costs increase our business and operating results could be harmed 

we may not attract train motivate and retain key personnel 

the market for technical creative marketing and other personnel essential to the development marketing and support of our products and services and management of our businesses is extremely competitive particularly in the geographic locations in which many of our key personnel are located in addition our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting our executives as well as key creative and technical talent we may experience significant compensation costs to hire and retain senior executives and other personnel that we deem critical to our success if we cannot successfully recruit train motivate and retain qualified employees or replace key employees following their departure our ability to develop and manage our business will be impaired 

we may experience declines or fluctuations in the recurring portion of our business 

our business model includes revenue that we deem recurring in nature such as revenue from our annualized sports franchises eg fifa madden nfl our console pc and mobile catalog titles ie titles that did not launch in the current fiscal year the associated live services and our subscriptions business while we have been able to forecast the revenue from these areas of our business with greater relative confidence than for new games services and business models we cannot provide assurances that consumer demand will remain consistent furthermore we may cease to offer games and services that we previously had deemed to be recurring in nature consumer demand may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their level of satisfaction with our games and services our ability to improve and innovate our annualized titles our ability to adapt our games and services to new platforms and business models outages and disruptions of online services the games and services offered by our competitors our marketing and advertising efforts or declines in consumer activity generally as a result of economic downturns among others the reception to our sports games also depends in part on the popularity reputation and brand of the leagues organizations and individual athletes with whom we partner events and circumstances outside of our control that have a negative 

impact on the popularity reputation and brand of these partners could also negatively impact sales related to our annualized sports games any decline or fluctuation in the recurring portion of our business may have a negative impact on our financial and operating results 

we could fail to successfully adopt new business models 

from time to time we seek to establish and implement new business models forecasting the success of any new business model is inherently uncertain and depends on a number of factors both within and outside of our control our actual revenue and profit for these businesses may be significantly greater or less than our forecasts in addition these new business models could fail resulting in the loss of our investment in the development and infrastructure needed to support these new business models as well as the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from more successful and established businesses for example we have devoted financial and operational resources to our subscription offerings without any assurance that these businesses will be financially successful while we anticipate growth in this area of our business consumer demand is difficult to predict as a result of a number of factors including satisfaction with our products and services our ability to provide engaging products and services third parties offering their products and services within our subscription platform providers providing access to our subscription products and services offered by our competitors reliability of our infrastructure and the infrastructure of our platform partners pricing the actual or perceived security of our and our platform partners information technology systems and reductions in consumer spending levels in addition if our subscription offerings are successful sales could be diverted from established business models if we do not select a target price that is optimal for our subscription services maintain our target pricing structure or correctly project renewal rates our financial results may be harmed 

acquisitions investments divestitures and other strategic transactions could result in   operating difficulties and other negative   consequences 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions including 1 acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets 2 minority investments in strategic partners and 3 investments in new interactive entertainment businesses as part of our longterm business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment that we acquire liabilities that our due diligence process does not identify significant issues liabilities or other challenges diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses in addition we may not integrate these businesses successfully or achieve expected synergies for example we may experience difficulties with the integration of business systems and technologies the integration and retention of new employees the implementation or remediation of the internal control environment of the acquired entity or the maintenance of key business and customer relationships these events could harm our operating results or financial condition we also may divest or sell assets or a business and we may have difficulty selling such assets or business on acceptable terms in a timely manner this could result in a delay in the achievement of our strategic objectives cause us to incur additional expense or the sale of such assets or business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we anticipated 

we may be unable to maintain or acquire licenses to include intellectual property owned by others in our games or to maintain or acquire the rights to publish or distribute games developed by others 

many of our products and services are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our ea sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues teams and players’ associations and our star wars products include rights licensed from disney competition for these licenses and rights is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses and rights or obtain additional licenses or rights with significant commercial value our ability to develop successful and engaging products and services may be adversely affected and our revenue profitability and cash flows may decline significantly competition for these licenses also may increase the amounts that we must pay to licensors and developers through higher minimum guarantees or royalty rates which could significantly increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

we rely on the systems of our platform partners who have significant influence over the products and services that we offer on their systems 

a significant percentage of our digital net revenue is attributable to sales of products and services through our significant platform partners including sony microsoft nintendo apple and google the concentration of a material portion of our digital sales in these platform partners exposes us to risks associated with these businesses any deterioration in the businesses of our platform partners could disrupt and harm our business including by limiting the methods through which our digital products and services are offered and exposing us to collection risks 

in addition our license agreements with our platform partners typically give them significant control over the approval manufacturing and distribution of the products and services that we develop for their platform in particular our arrangements with sony and microsoft could in certain circumstances leave us unable to get our products and services approved manufactured or distributed to consumers for our digital products and services delivered via digital channels maintained by among others sony microsoft nintendo apple and google each respective platform partner has policies and guidelines that control the promotion and distribution of these titles and the features and functionalities that we are permitted to offer through the channel in addition we are dependent on our platform partners to invest in and upgrade digital commerce capabilities in a manner than corresponds to the way in which consumers purchase our products and services failure by our platform partners to keep pace with consumer preferences could have an adverse impact on our ability to merchandise and commercialize our products and services which could harm our business andor financial results 

moreover certain of our platform partners can determine and change unilaterally certain key terms and conditions including the ability to change their user and developer policies and guidelines in many cases our platform partners also set the rates that we must pay to provide our games and services through their online channels and retain flexibility to change their fee structures or adopt different fee structures for their online channels which could adversely impact our costs profitability and margins in addition our platform partners control the information technology systems through which online sales of our products and service channels are captured if our platform partners establish terms that restrict our offerings through their platforms significantly impact the financial terms on which these products or services are offered to our customers or their information technology systems experiences outages that impact our players’ ability to access our games or make ingame purchases or cause an unanticipated delay in reporting our business andor financial results could be materially affected 

our business is subject to economic and market conditions particularly risks generally associated with the entertainment industry 

our business is subject to economic and market conditions which are beyond our control the united states and other international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time worsening economic conditions that negatively impact discretionary consumer spending including inflation slower growth recession and other macroeconomic conditions including those resulting from geopolitical issues and uncertainty could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results for example the government of the united kingdom has initiated a process to leave the european union “brexit” and may do so without an agreement governing the terms and conditions of their exit brexit has caused economic and legal uncertainty in the region and may result in macroeconomic conditions that adversely affect our business in addition evolving immigration rules and trade regimes could negatively impact our business we have taken precautionary measures with respect to these matters in relation to brexit and otherwise but given the significant uncertainty our precautions may not be adequate 

we are particularly susceptible to market conditions and risks associated with the entertainment industry which in addition to general macroeconomic downturns also include the popularity price and timing of our games changes in consumer demographics the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted 

our business partners may be unable to honor their obligations to us or their actions may put us at risk 

we rely on various business partners including thirdparty service providers vendors licensing partners development partners and licensees in many areas of our business their actions may put our business and our reputation and brand at risk for example we may have disputes with our business partners that may impact our business andor financial results in many cases our business partners may be given access to sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support to our teams and they may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it in addition the failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies or the failure of the third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies could result in a disruption to our business operations further disruptions in the financial markets economic downturns poor business decisions or reputational harm may adversely affect our business partners and they may not be able to continue honoring their obligations to us or we may cease our arrangements with them alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner or vendor if we lose one or more significant business partners our business could be harmed and our financial results could be materially affected 

the products or services we release may contain defects bugs or errors 

our products and services are extremely complex software programs and are difficult to develop and distribute we have quality controls in place to detect defects bugs or other errors in our products and services before they are released nonetheless these 

quality controls are subject to human error overriding and reasonable resource or technical constraints therefore these quality controls and preventative measures may not be effective in detecting all defects bugs or errors in our products and services before they have been released into the marketplace in such an event the technological reliability and stability of our products and services could be below our standards and the standards of consumers and our reputation brand and sales could be adversely affected in addition we could be required to or may find it necessary to offer a refund for the product or service suspend the availability or sale of the product or service or expend significant resources to cure the defect bug or error each of which could significantly harm our business and operating results 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights 

from time to time third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights for example patent holding companies may assert patent claims against us in which they seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained although we take steps to avoid knowingly violating the intellectual property rights of others it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement 

existing or future infringement claims against us whether valid or not may be expensive to defend and divert the attention of our employees from business operations such claims or litigation could require us to pay damages and other costs we also could be required to stop selling distributing or supporting products features or services which incorporate the affected intellectual property rights redesign products features or services to avoid infringement or obtain a license all of which could be costly and harm our business 

in addition many patents have been issued that may apply to potential new modes of delivering playing or monetizing interactive entertainment software products and services such as those that we produce or would like to offer in the future we may discover that future opportunities to provide new and innovative modes of game play and game delivery to consumers may be precluded by existing patents that we are unable to license on reasonable terms 

from time to time we may become involved in other legal proceedings 

we are currently and from time to time in the future may become subject to legal proceedings claims litigation and government investigations or inquiries which could be expensive lengthy disruptive to normal business operations and occupy a significant amount of our employees’ time and attention in addition the outcome of any legal proceedings claims litigation investigations or inquiries may be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating results or financial condition 

our products and brands are subject to the threat of piracy unauthorized copying and other forms of intellectual property infringement 

we regard our products and brands as proprietary and take measures to protect our products brands and other confidential information from infringement we are aware that some unauthorized copying of our products and brands occurs and if a significantly greater amount were to occur it could negatively impact our business 

piracy and other forms of unauthorized copying and use of our content and brands are persistent problems for us and policing is difficult further the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be distributed either do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states or are poorly enforced legal protection of our rights may be ineffective in such countries in addition although we take steps to enforce and police our rights factors such as   the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures used by our business partners or by us the availability of broadband access to the internet the refusal of internet service providers or platform holders to remove infringing content in certain instances and the proliferation of online channels through which infringing product is distributed all have contributed to an expansion in unauthorized copying of our products and brands 

we may experience outages disruptions andor degradations of our infrastructure 

we may experience outrages disruptions andor degradations of our infrastructure including information technology system failures and network disruptions that harm our ability to conduct normal business operations these may be caused by natural disasters cyberincidents weather events power disruptions telecommunications failures failed upgrades of existing systems or migrations to new systems acts of terrorism or other events including cyberattacks or malicious software programs that exploit vulnerabilities system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could prevent access to our products services or online stores selling our products and services interruption in our ability to conduct critical business functions breaches of data security or the loss of critical data our corporate headquarters in redwood city ca and our studios in los angeles california seattle washington and in burnaby british columbia are located in seismically active regions and certain of our game development activities and other essential business operations are conducted at these locations an event that results in the disruption or degradation of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and materially impact our reputation and brand financial condition and operating results 

a significant portion of our packaged goods sales are made to a relatively small number of   retail and distribution partners and these sales may be disrupted 

we derive a significant percentage of our net revenue attributable to sales of our packaged goods products to our top retail and distribution partners the concentration of a significant percentage of these sales through a few large partners could lead to a shortterm disruption to our business if certain of these partners significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to offer our products we also could be more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these partners experienced a deterioration of their business or declared bankruptcy additionally receivables from these partners generally increase in our december fiscal quarter as sales of our products generally increase in anticipation of the holiday season having a significant portion of our packaged goods sales concentrated in a few partners could reduce our negotiating leverage with them if one or more of these partners experience deterioration in their business or become unable to obtain sufficient financing to maintain their operations our business could be harmed 

external game developers may not meet product development schedules or otherwise honor their obligations 

we may contract with external game developers to develop our games or to publish or distribute their games while we maintain contractual protections we have less control over the product development schedules of games developed by external developers and we depend on their ability to meet product development schedules in addition we may have disputes with external developers over game content launch timing achievement of certain milestones the game development timeline marketing campaigns or other matters if we have disputes with external developers or they cannot meet product development schedules acquire certain approvals or are otherwise unable or unwilling to honor their obligations to us we may delay or cancel previously announced games alter our launch schedule or experience increased costs and expenses which could result in a delay or significant shortfall in anticipated revenue harm our profitability and reputation and cause our financial results to be materially affected 

our financial results are subject to currency fluctuations 

international sales are a fundamental part of our business for our fiscal year ended march 31 2019 international net revenue comprised 61 percent of our total net revenue and we expect our international business to continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue as a result of our international sales and also the denomination of our foreign investments and our cash and cash equivalents in foreign currencies we are exposed to the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates strengthening of the us dollar particularly relative to the euro british pound sterling australian dollar chinese yuan and south korean won has a negative impact on our reported international net revenue but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses particularly when the us dollar strengthens against the swedish krona and the canadian dollar because these amounts are translated at lower rates we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency risk however these activities are limited in the protection they provide us from foreign currency fluctuations and can themselves result in losses 

we utilize debt financing and such indebtedness could adversely impact our business and financial condition 

we have 1 billion in senior unsecured notes outstanding as well as an unsecured committed 500 million revolving credit facility while the facility is currently undrawn we may use the proceeds of any future borrowings for general corporate purposes we may also enter into other financial instruments in the future 

our indebtedness could affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

 

 

 

the agreements governing our indebtedness impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants in particular the revolving credit facility includes a maximum capitalization ratio and minimum liquidity requirements our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of these covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities as well as the potential costs associated with any potential refinancing our indebtedness downgrades in our credit rating could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing 

changes in our tax rates exposure to additional tax liabilities changes to tax laws and interpretations of tax laws could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision tax assets and accruals for other taxes and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective income tax rate is based in part on our corporate operating structure and the manner in which we operate our business and develop value and use our intellectual property taxing authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for calculating our income tax provision or its underlying assumptions which could increase our effective income tax rate and have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows in addition our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our profit levels changes in our business changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the elections we make changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in applicable tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws as well as other factors for example the outcome of altera corp v commissioner  currently pending before the ninth circuit court of appeals as well as future regulations and guidance related to the us tax act could cause us to change our analysis and materially impact our previous estimates and consolidated financial statements further changes to us federal state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals particularly in switzerland where our international publishing business is headquartered and changes in such jurisdictions’ interpretations decisions policies or positions with respect to existing tax laws could adversely affect our effective tax rates cause us to change the way in which we structure our business or result in other costs 

we are required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions several foreign jurisdictions have introduced new digital services taxes on revenue of companies that provide certain digital services there is limited guidance about the applicability to these new taxes to our business and significant uncertainty as to of the digital services that will be deemed in scope if these new taxes are applied to the company’s revenue in these foreign jurisdictions it could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance furthermore we are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities with respect to both income and such other nonincome taxes unfavorable audit results or tax rulings or other changes resulting in significant additional tax liabilities could have material adverse effects upon our earnings cash flows and financial condition 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in   financial accounting standards 

our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting standards promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies these methods estimates and judgments are subject to risks uncertainties assumptions and changes that could adversely affect our reported financial position and financial results in addition changes to applicable financial accounting standards could impact our reported financial position and financial results for more information on recently adopted accounting standards and recently issued accounting standards applicable to us see part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in note 1 — description of business and basis of presentation  under the subheadings “ recently adopted accounting standards ” and “ other recently issued accounting standards ” 

as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue costs and taxes could have an adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to our operating results or factors specific to our operating results including those discussed in the risk factors above as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our future financial performance ratings or recommendations our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts’ and investors’ expectations factors affecting the entertainment computer software internet media or electronics industries the announcement and integration of any acquisitions we may make departure of key personnel cyberattacks national or international economic conditions investor sentiment or other factors related or unrelated to our operating performance in particular economic downturns may contribute to the public stock markets experiencing extreme price and trading volume volatility these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following overview is a highlevel discussion of our operating results as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers provides important context for our results for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form 10k including in the “business” section and the “risk factors” above the remainder of this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda”” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

about electronic arts 

we are a global leader in digital interactive entertainment with a mission to inspire the world to play we develop market publish and deliver games and services that can be played and watched on a variety of platforms including game consoles pcs mobile phones and tablets in our games and services we use brands that we either wholly own such as battlefield the sims apex legends anthem need for speed and plants v zombies or license from others such as fifa madden nfl and star wars we develop and publish games and services across diverse genres such as sports firstperson shooter action roleplaying and simulation and offer our games and services through diverse business models and distribution channels such as retail download subscription and freetoplay we believe that the breadth and depth of our portfolio and our flexibility in business models and distribution channels provide us with strategic advantages 

financial results 

our key financial results for our fiscal year ended march 31 2019  were as follows 

 

from time to time we make comparisons of current periods to prior periods with reference to constant currency for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019 foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our net revenue and operating expenses 

trends in our business 

digital business  players increasingly purchase our games as digital downloads as opposed to purchasing physical discs and engage with the live services that we provide on an ongoing basis our live services provide additional depth and engagement opportunities for our players and include ingame purchases extra content subscriptions and esports our net revenue attributable to live services comprised 45 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2019 and we expect that live services net revenue will continue to be material to our business our most popular live service is the ultimate team  mode associated with our sports franchises ultimate team  allows players to collect current and former professional players in order to build and compete as a personalized team net revenue from ultimate team  represented approximately 28 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2019 a substantial portion of which was derived from fifa ultimate team  our digital transformation also is creating opportunities in platforms content models and the way in which players engage with our games and services for example we have leveraged brands and assets from franchises historically associated traditional gaming such as fifa madden nfl the sims simcity and star wars to create freetoplay games that are monetized through live services provided with the game we also offer subscription services such as ea access origin access and origin access premier as we look to build deeper relationships with our players and offer increased choice and flexibility for our players to try new games 

the portion of our revenue attributable to our digital business has significantly increased from 59 percent in fiscal year 2017 to 67 percent in fiscal year 2018 and 75 percent during fiscal year 2019 we expect this portion of our business to continue to increase during fiscal year 2020 relative to packaged goods revenue as we continue to focus on developing and monetizing products and services that can be delivered digitally 

technological infrastructure as our digital business has grown our games and services increasingly depend on the reliability availability and security of our technological infrastructure we are investing and expect to continue to invest in technology hardware and software to support our games and services including with respect to security protections our industry is prone to and our systems and networks are subject to cyberattacks computer viruses worms phishing attacks malicious software programs and other information security incidents that seek to exploit disable damage disrupt or gain access to our networks our products and services supporting technological infrastructure intellectual property and other assets we expect these threats to our systems and networks to continue 

rapidly changing industry  we operate in a dynamic industry that regularly experiences periods of rapid fundamental change in order to remain successful we are required to anticipate sometimes years in advance the ways in which our products and services will compete in the market we adapt our business by investing in creative and technical talent and new technologies evolving our business strategies and distribution methods and developing new and engaging products and services in fiscal 2019 we launched two new intellectual properties anthem and apex legends brought apex legends to market as our first freetoplay console product added frontline titles to our origin access premier subscription service and invested in more ways to reach our players now and in the future such as cloud gaming and esports we expect to continue to invest in our business to remain competitive including investments in among other things technology to connect our players to each other and to the games they love and the infrastructure to power our games and services we are adopting consistent crosscompany methodologies to better understand our players’ needs and continue to invest in technology that enables us to deliver content that will resonate with players and provide more choice in the way that players connect with their games with each other and with new types of content including esports broadcasts this connection also allows us to market and deliver content and services for popular franchises like fifa battlefield and star wars to our players more efficiently 

freetoplay games  the global adoption of mobile devices and a business model for those devices that allows consumers to try new games with no upfront cost and that are monetized through the live service associated with the game has led to significant growth in the mobile gaming industry we expect the mobile gaming industry to continue to grow during our 2020 fiscal year likewise the consumer acceptance of freetoplay live servicebased online pc games has broadened our consumer base and this freetoplay live service business model is beginning to gain consumer acceptance with respect to console games we expect revenue generated from mobile pc and console freetoplay games to remain an important part of our business 

concentration of sales among the most popular games  in all major segments of our industry we see a large portion of games sales concentrated on the most popular titles similarly a significant portion of our revenue historically has been derived from games based on a few popular franchises several of which we have released on an annual or biannual basis in particular we have historically derived a significant portion of our net revenue from our largest and most popular game fifa the annualized version of which is consistently one of the bestselling games in the marketplace 

recurring revenue sources our business model includes revenue that we deem recurring in nature such as revenue from our annualized sports franchises eg fifa madden nfl our console pc and mobile catalog titles ie titles that did not launch in the current fiscal year the associated live services and our subscriptions business we have been able to forecast the revenue from these areas of our business with greater relative confidence than for new games services and business models as we continue to incorporate new business models and modalities of play into our games our goal is to continue to look for opportunities to expand the recurring portion of our business 

net bookings  in order to improve transparency into our business we disclose an operating performance metric net bookings net bookings is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or soldin physically in the period net bookings is calculated by adding total net revenue to the change in deferred net revenue for onlineenabled games and for periods after the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 mobile platform fees 

the following is a calculation of our total net bookings for the periods presented 



net bookings were 4944 million for fiscal 2019 driven by sales related to fifa ultimate team  fifa 19  madden nfl 19 the sims 4 and  battlefield v  net bookings decreased 236 million or 5 percent as compared to fiscal 2018 due primarily to a decrease in star wars battlefront ii need for speed payback  and mass effect andromeda    partially offset by battlefield v anthem and  apex legends digital net bookings were 3722 million for fiscal 2019 driven by sales of fifa ultimate team  the sims 4  and madden nfl 19  an increase of 184 million or 5 percent as compared to fiscal 2018 the increase in digital net bookings was driven by growth in live services which grew 211 million or 10 percent yearoveryear primarily due to growth in bookings associated with fifa   ultimate team  and bookings from apex legends  and full game downloads which grew 56 million or 8 percent yearoveryear due to continued growth in digital downloads of our games in particular battlefield v anthem and   the fifa franchise were downloaded at a greater rate than comparable titles in previous fiscal years these increases were offset by a decrease of 83 million or 13 percent in our mobile business primarily due to declines from aging titles across our portfolio 

     recent developments 

internal transfer of intellectual property rights  subsequent to the fiscal year ended march 31 2019 we completed an intraentity sale of some of our intellectual property rights to our swiss subsidiary where our international business is headquartered this transaction will result in the recognition of a deferred tax asset which we estimate at approximately 23 billion subject to a realizability analysis for more information please see part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 11 — income taxes  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities contingent assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown as a result actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

for a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates with respect to revenue recognition for revenue transactions occurring prior to april 1 2018 which were accounted for under asc 605 revenue recognition  the “old revenue standard” or “asc 605” refer to part ii item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” under the subheading critical accounting policies and estimates  included in our annual report on form 10k for our fiscal year ended march 31 2018 filed with the sec on may 23 2018 with respect to revenue transactions occurring on april 1 2018 and onward our revenue recognition accounting policy is set forth below and follows asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  the “new revenue standard” or “asc 606”    

revenue recognition 

we derive revenue principally from sales of our games and related extracontent and services that can be played by customers on a variety of platforms which include game consoles pcs mobile phones and tablets our product and service offerings include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

effective april 1 2018 we evaluate revenue recognition based on the criteria set forth in asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  

we evaluate and recognize revenue by 

 

 

 

 

 

certain of our full game andor extra content are sold to resellers with a contingency that the full game andor extra content cannot be resold prior to a specific date “street date contingency” we recognize revenue for transactions that have a street 

date contingency when the street date contingency is removed and the full game andor extra content can be resold by the reseller for digital full game andor extra content downloads sold to customers we recognize revenue when the full game andor extra content is made available for download to the customer 

onlineenabled games 

games with services our sales of games with services are evaluated to determine whether the software license future update rights and the online hosting are distinct and separable sales of games with services are generally determined to have three distinct performance obligations software license future update rights and the online hosting 

since we do not sell the performance obligations on a standalone basis we consider market conditions and other observable inputs to estimate the standalone selling price for each performance obligation we recognize revenue from these arrangements upon transfer of control for each performance obligation for the portion of the transaction price allocated to the software license revenue is recognized when control of the license has been transferred to the customer for the portion of the transaction price allocated to the future update rights and the online hosting revenue is recognized as the services are provided 

onlinehosted service games sales of our onlinehosted service games are determined to have one distinct performance obligation the online hosting we recognize revenue from these arrangements as the service is provided 

extra content  revenue received from sales of downloadable content are derived primarily from the sale of virtual currencies and digital ingame content to our customers to enhance their gameplay experience sales of extra content are accounted for in a manner consistent with the treatment for our games with services and onlinehosted service games as discussed above depending upon whether or not the extra content has offline functionality 

subscriptions 

revenue from subscriptions is recognized over the subscription term as the service is provided 

licensing revenue 

  

in certain countries we utilize thirdparty licensees to distribute and host our games in accordance with license agreements for which the licensees typically pay us a fixed minimum guarantee andor salesbased royalties these arrangements typically include multiple performance obligations such as a timebased license of software and future update rights we recognize as revenue a portion of the minimum guarantee when we transfer control of the license of software generally upon commercial launch and the remaining portion ratably over the contractual term in which we provide the licensee with future update rights any salesbased royalties are generally recognized as the related sales occur by the licensee 

revenue classification 

we classify our revenue as either product revenue or service and other revenue generally performance obligations that are recognized upfront upon transfer of control are classified as product revenue while performance obligations that are recognized over the estimated offering period or subscription period as the services are provided are classified as service revenue 

product revenue  our product revenue includes revenue allocated to the software license performance obligation product revenue also includes revenue from the licensing of software to thirdparties 

service and other revenue  our service revenue includes revenue allocated to the future update rights and the online hosting performance obligations this also includes revenue allocated to the future update rights from the licensing of software to thirdparties software that offers an onlineonly service such as our ultimate team game mode and subscription services 

significant judgments around revenue arrangements 

identifying performance obligations  performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct ie the customer can benefit from the goods or services either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and are distinct in the context of the contract ie it is separately identifiable from other goods or services in the contract to the extent a contract includes multiple promises we must apply judgment to determine whether those promises are separate and distinct performance obligations if these criteria are not met the promises are accounted for as a combined performance obligation 

determining the transaction price   the transaction price is determined based on the consideration that we will be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring our goods and services to the customer determining the transaction price often requires significant judgment based on an assessment of contractual terms and business practices it further includes review of variable consideration such as discounts sales returns price protection and rebates which is estimated at the time of the transaction see below for additional information regarding our sales returns and price protection reserves in addition the transaction price does not include an estimate of the variable consideration related to salesbased royalties salesbased royalties are recognized as the sales occur 

allocating the transaction price allocating the transaction price requires that we determine an estimate of the relative standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation determining the relative standalone selling price is inherently subjective especially in situations where we do not sell the performance obligation on a standalone basis which occurs in the majority of our transactions in those situations we determine the relative standalone selling price based on various observable inputs using all information that is reasonably available examples of observable inputs and information include historical internal pricing data cost plus margin analyses thirdparty external pricing of similar or same products and services such as software licenses and maintenance support within the enterprise software industry the results of our analysis resulted in a specific percentage of the transaction price being allocated to each performance obligation 

determining the estimated offering period  the offering period is the period in which we offer to provide the future update rights andor online hosting for the game and related extra content sold because the offering period is not an explicitly defined period we must make an estimate of the offering period for the service related performance obligations ie future update rights and online hosting determining the estimated offering period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision generally we consider the average period of time customers are online when estimating the offering period we also consider the estimated period of time between the date a game unit is sold to a reseller and the date the reseller sells the game unit to the customer ie time in channel based on these two factors we then consider the method of distribution for example games sold at retail would have a composite offering period equal to the online gameplay period plus time in channel as opposed to digitallydistributed software licenses which are delivered immediately via digital download and therefore the offering period is estimated to be only the online gameplay period 

additionally we consider results from prior analyses known and expected online gameplay trends as well as disclosed service periods for competitors’ games in determining the estimated offering period for future sales   we believe this provides a reasonable depiction of the transfer of future update rights and online hosting to our customers as it is the best representation of the time period during which our games are played we recognize revenue for future update rights and online hosting performance obligations ratably on a straightline basis over this period as there is a consistent pattern of delivery for these performance obligations these performance obligations are generally recognized over an estimated ninemonth period beginning in the month after shipment for software licenses sold through retail and an estimated sixmonth period for digitallydistributed software licenses beginning in the month of sale 

deferred net revenue 

because the majority of our sales transactions include future update rights and online hosting performance obligations which are subject to a recognition period of generally six to nine months our deferred net revenue balance is material this balance increases from period to period by the revenue being deferred for current sales with these service obligations and is reduced by the recognition of revenue from prior sales that were deferred generally revenue is recognized as the services are provided 

principal agent considerations 

we evaluate sales to end customers of our full games and related content via thirdparty storefronts including digital storefronts such as microsoft’s xbox store sony’s playstation store apple app store and google play store in order to determine whether or not we are acting as the principal in the sale to the end customer which we consider in determining if revenue should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the thirdparty storefront an entity is the principal if it controls a good or service before it is transferred to the end customer key indicators that we evaluate in determining gross versus net treatment include but are not limited to the following 

 

based on an evaluation of the above indicators except as discussed below we have determined that generally the third party is considered the principal to end customers for the sale of our full games and related content we therefore report revenue related to these arrangements net of the fees retained by the storefront however for sales arrangements via apple app store and google play store ea is considered the principal to the end customer and thus we report revenue on a gross basis and mobile platform fees are reported within cost of revenue 

payment terms 

substantially all of our transactions have payment terms whether customary or on an extended basis of less than one year therefore we generally do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of any potential financing components that may exist 

sales and valueadded taxes 

revenue is recorded net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed at the time of the specific revenueproducing transaction between us and our customer such as sales and valueadded taxes 

sales returns and price protection reserves 

sales returns and price protection are considered variable consideration under asc 606 we reduce revenue for estimated future returns and price protection which may occur with our distributors and retailers “channel partners” price protection represents our practice to provide our channel partners with a credit allowance to lower their wholesale price on a particular game unit that they have not resold to customers the amount of the price protection for permanent markdowns is the difference between the old wholesale price and the new reduced wholesale price credits are also given for shortterm promotions that temporarily reduce the wholesale price in certain countries we also have a practice for allowing channel partners to return older products in the channel in exchange for a credit allowance 

when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection reserves we analyze the following historical credit allowances current sellthrough of our channel partners’ inventory of our products current trends in retail and the video game industry changes in customer demand acceptance of our products and other related factors in addition we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection in subsequent periods 

in the future actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in customer preferences market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms product updates or competing products while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters these estimates are inherently subjective accordingly if our estimates change our returns and price protection reserves would change and would impact the transaction price and thus the total net revenue and related balance sheet accounts that we report 

fair value estimates 

business combinations    we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities and contingencies assumed acquired inprocess technology and contingent consideration issued in a business combination our assessment of the estimated fair value 

of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various estimated useful lives furthermore the estimated fair value assigned to an acquired asset or liability has a direct impact on the amount we recognize as goodwill which is an asset that is not amortized determining the fair value of assets acquired requires an assessment of the highest and best use or the expected price to sell the asset and the related expected future cash flows determining the fair value of acquired inprocess technology also requires an assessment of our expectations related to the use of that technology determining the fair value of an assumed liability requires an assessment of the expected cost to transfer the liability determining the fair value of contingent consideration requires an assessment of the probabilityweighted expected future cash flows over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled and applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration payable are forecasted earnings significant changes in forecasted earnings would result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurement this fair value assessment is also required in periods subsequent to a business combination such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both 1 the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and 2 the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carryforwards we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified it is generally difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is significant negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years forecasts of future taxable income are considered to be less objective than past results therefore cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 

in addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities the carryback of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law and the implementation of tax planning strategies evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence this evaluation involves assumptions about future activity certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “us tax act” was enacted which significantly revised the us corporate income tax system by among other things lowering the us corporate income tax rates to 21 percent generally implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime transition tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries the “transition tax” we have concluded the accounting under the us tax act within the time period set forth in sab 118 the sec guidance that allowed for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the us tax act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts including the impacts of the transition tax the remeasurement of us deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the reduction of the us corporate tax rate and the accounting policy election related to us taxes on foreign earnings we recorded tax expense of 235 million related to the us tax act for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018 192 million of which relates to the transition tax during the fiscal year ended march 31 2019 we made no material adjustments to our provisional amounts recognized due to the us tax act during the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  

the us tax act creates new us taxes on foreign earnings an accounting policy election is available to either recognize the deferred tax impacts of the us taxes on foreign earnings or to account for them as a period cost we have elected to account for the impacts of these new taxes as a period cost 

prior to the us tax act a substantial majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were considered to be indefinitely reinvested as a result of the us tax act substantially all previously unremitted earnings for which no us deferred tax liability had been accrued have now been subject to us tax any future earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are generally available for repatriation without a material incremental us tax cost 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate these estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation 

as well as with respect to other matters such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities the ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations in addition changes in our business including acquisitions changes in our international corporate structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix and amount of income as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities valuation allowances applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective tax rate

income taxes 

provision for income taxes for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was as follows in millions 

our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019 was 56 percent as compared 280 percent for the same period in fiscal year 2018 our effective tax rate and resulting provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019 was significantly lower than the same period in fiscal year 2018 due to the recognition of the impacts of the us tax act in fiscal year ended march 31 2018 a change in the mix of earnings and the lower statutory tax rate applied to earnings realized in the us the us tax act significantly revised the us corporate income tax system by among other things lowering the us corporate income tax rate to 21 percent generally implementing a territorial tax system and imposing the transition tax 

we have concluded the accounting under the us tax act within the time period set forth in sab 118 the sec guidance that allowed for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the us tax act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts including the impacts of the transition tax the remeasurement of us deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the reduction of the us corporate tax rate and the accounting policy election related to us taxes on foreign earnings we recorded tax expense of 235 million related to the us tax act for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018 192 million of which relates to the transition tax during the year ended march 31 2019 we made no material adjustments to our provisional amounts recognized due to the us tax act during the fiscal year ended march 31 2018 

the us tax act creates new us taxes on foreign earnings an accounting policy election is available to either recognize the deferred tax impacts of the us taxes on foreign earnings or to account for them as a period cost we have elected to account for the impacts of these new taxes as a period cost 

our effective tax rates for fiscal year 2020 and future periods will continue to depend on a variety of factors including changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions our corporate structure the geographic location of business functions or assets the geographic mix of income our agreements with tax authorities applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in our annual pretax income or loss we anticipate that the impact of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies may result in significant fluctuations to our effective tax rate in the future 

subsequent to the fiscal year ended march 31 2019 we completed an intraentity sale of some of our intellectual property rights to our swiss subsidiary where our international business is headquartered the transaction did not result in a taxable gain under us gaap any profit resulting from this intercompany transaction will be eliminated upon consolidation however the transaction resulted in a stepup of the swiss tax deductible basis in the transferred intellectual property rights and accordingly created a temporary difference between the book basis and the tax basis of such intellectual property rights as a result this transaction will result in the recognition of a deferred tax asset which we estimate at approximately 23 billion subject to a realizability analysis the deferred tax asset will be recognized as a onetime tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements during the three months ending june 30 2019 this deferred tax asset will reverse over a 20year period and is subject to a periodic realizability analysis the deferred tax asset and the onetime tax benefit will be measured based on the swiss tax rate expected to apply in the years the asset will be recovered we will not recognize any deferred taxes related to the us taxes on foreign earnings associated with this transfer due to our policy election to recognize these taxes as a period cost we do not expect the transaction to impact our cash taxes or our operating cash flow in fiscal year 2020

changes in cash flow 

operating activities  net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 145 million  during fiscal year 2019  as compared to fiscal year 2018  the decrease is primarily driven by lower cash receipts related to a decrease in net bookings and an increase in cash paid for taxes partially offset by lower royalty payments and higher interest income 

investing activities  net cash provided by investing activities decreased by 453 million  during fiscal year 2019  as compared to fiscal year 2018  primarily driven by a 1478 million  decrease in proceeds from the sales and maturities of shortterm investments this was partially offset by a 945 million  decrease in the purchase of shortterm investments and a 92 million decrease in payments in connection with mergers and acquisitions activity 

financing activities  net cash used in financing activities increased by 610 million  during fiscal year 2019  as compared to fiscal year 2018  primarily due to a 591 million increase in the repurchase and retirement of our common stock 

shortterm investments 

due to our mix of fixed and variable rate securities our shortterm investment portfolio is susceptible to changes in shortterm interest rates as of march 31 2019  our shortterm investments had gross unrealized losses of 1 million  or less than 1 percent of the total in shortterm investments and gross unrealized gains of less than 1 million  or less than 1 percent of the total in shortterm investments from time to time we may liquidate some or all of our shortterm investments to fund operational needs or other activities such as capital expenditures business acquisitions or stock repurchase programs

financial condition 

we believe that our cash cash equivalents shortterm investments cash generated from operations and available financing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next 12 months including working capital requirements capital expenditures debt repayment obligations and potentially future acquisitions stock repurchases or strategic investments we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to repay debt strengthen our financial position facilitate expansion repurchase our stock pursue strategic acquisitions and investments andor to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise there can be no assurance however that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms if at all or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 

in may 2018 a special committee of our board of directors on behalf of the full board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 24 billion  of our common stock this stock repurchase program supersedes and replaces the may 2017 program and expires on may 31 2020 under this program we may purchase stock in the open market or through privatelynegotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws including pursuant to prearranged stock trading plans the timing and actual amount of the stock repurchases will depend on several factors including price capital availability regulatory requirements alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions we are not obligated to repurchase a specific number of shares under this program and it may be modified suspended or discontinued at any time we repurchased approximately 104 million  shares for approximately 1116 million  under this program during the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  we are actively repurchasing shares under this program 

we have a “shelf” registration statement on form s3 on file with the sec this shelf registration statement which includes a base prospectus allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus we would use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes which may include funding for working capital financing capital expenditures research and development marketing and distribution efforts and if opportunities arise for acquisitions or strategic alliances pending such uses we may invest the net proceeds in interestbearing securities in addition we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time 

our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those related to customer demand and acceptance of our products our ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due successfully achieving our product release schedules and attaining our forecasted sales objectives the impact of acquisitions and other strategic transactions in which we may engage the impact of competition economic conditions in the united states and abroad the seasonal and cyclical nature of our business and operating results risks of product returns and the other risks described in the “ risk factors ” section included in part i item 1a of this report

inflation 

we believe the impact of inflation on our results of operations has not been significant in any of the past three fiscal years 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market prices which have experienced significant volatility market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below while we do not hedge our shortterm investment portfolio we protect our shortterm investment portfolio against different market risks including interest rate risk as discussed below our cash and cash equivalents portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for speculative trading purposes and do not hedge our market price risk relating to marketable equity securities if any 

foreign currency exchange risk 

foreign currency exchange rates international sales are a fundamental part of our business and the strengthening of the us dollar particularly relative to the euro british pound sterling australian dollar chinese yuan and south korean won has a negative impact on our reported international net revenue but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses particularly the swedish krona and canadian dollar because these amounts are translated at lower rates as compared to periods in which the us dollar is weaker while we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risk these activities are limited in the protection that they provide us and can themselves result in losses 

cash flow hedging activities  we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreigncurrencydenominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing foreign currency forward contracts that generally have maturities of 18 months  or less these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements in net revenue and research and development expenses 

balance sheet hedging activities  we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk associated with foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily intercompany receivables and payables the foreign currency forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three months or less and are transacted near monthend 

we believe the counterparties to our foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations as of march 31 2019  a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent  or 20 percent  would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value on our foreign currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging of 159 million  or 318 million  respectively as of march 31 2019  a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent  or 20 percent  would have resulted in potential losses on our foreign currency forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of 84 million  or 167 million  respectively this sensitivity analysis assumes an adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates however all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and actual results may differ materially see note 5 — derivative financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as it relates to our derivative financial instruments which is incorporated by reference into this item 7a 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities however because shortterm investments mature relatively quickly and if reinvested are invested at the thencurrent market rates interest income on a portfolio consisting of shortterm investments is subject to market fluctuations to a greater extent than a portfolio of longer term investments additionally the contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to call prepay or otherwise settle the investments at prices less than the stated par value our investments are held for purposes other than trading we do not use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio 

as of march 31 2019  our shortterm investments were classified as availableforsale securities and consequently were recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax in stockholders’ equity 

notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations fluctuations in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio the following table presents the hypothetical changes in the fair value of our shortterm investment portfolio as of march 31 2019  arising from potential changes in interest rates the modeling technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps

 item 1 business 

overview 

we are a global leader in digital interactive entertainment with a mission to inspire the world to play we develop market publish and distribute games content and services that can be played on a variety of platforms including game consoles pcs mobile phones and tablets 

our strategic pillars 

there are three core pillars to our strategy 

• players first 

• commitment to digital 

• one ea 

these strategic pillars are built on our focus of delivering a broad and deep portfolio of games and services that engages players across a wide range of geographies platforms and business models 

players first 

players are the foundation of our success and we are committed to thinking about players first in everything we do our goal is to build deep ongoing and meaningful relationships with our players we aim to build these relationships by creating amazing games and services that deliver longlasting fun and enduring value by connecting with our players across platforms and social channels and by delivering flexibility and innovation in our business models 

our games and services are based on a portfolio of intellectual property that includes established brands such as fifa madden nfl star wars battlefield the sims and need for speed we develop and publish a broad and deep portfolio of games and services that engage players across geographies platforms and business models 

commitment to digital 

players increasingly purchase our games as digital downloads as opposed to purchasing physical discs and engage with the live services that we provide on an ongoing basis our live services provide additional depth and engagement opportunities for our players and include microtransactions extra content subscriptions and esports for example the ultimate team  mode associated with our sports franchises and live services provided for our star wars battlefield and sims franchises have extended the life of those games by engaging players over longer periods of time the digital transformation also is creating opportunities in platforms content models and the way in which players engage with our games and services for example we have leveraged brands and assets from franchises historically associated with consoles and traditional pc gaming such as fifa madden nfl the sims simcity and star wars to create successful mobile games that are monetized through live services provided with the game we also offer subscription services such as ea access and origin access as we look to build deeper relationships with our players 

  

we have significantly increased our digital net revenue from 2409 billion in fiscal year 2016 to 2874 billion in fiscal year 2017 and 3450 billion during fiscal year 2018 it now comprises 67 of our total net revenue we believe that our digital revenue which generally has a higher gross margin relative to packaged goods revenue will continue to increase during fiscal year 2019 both relative to packaged goods revenue and in absolute terms as we continue to focus on developing and monetizing products and services that can be delivered digitally 

one ea 

as a global leader in digital interactive entertainment we have an opportunity to leverage our scale to deliver engaging games and services to more players across more platforms our “one ea” model provides strategic advantages for example we have moved substantially all of our pc and console development to one game engine and are working to do the same for the development of our mobile games and services this transition has created operational flexibility as our development teams now code on a consistent engine and can work across titles in addition it has accelerated the pace of our development as content and technological advances are leveraged across franchises we also can transition our products and services to new platforms quickly and costeffectively 

we also are strengthening our player network connecting our players to each other and to the games they love we are adopting consistent crosscompany methodologies to better understand our players’ needs and continue to invest in technology that enables us to build personalized player relationships that can last for years instead of days or weeks by connecting our players to us and to each other this connection allows us to market and deliver content and services for popular franchises like fifa battlefield and star wars to our players more efficiently that same foundation also enables new playercentric ways to discover and try new games and experiences such as our subscriptionbased ea access and origin access services 

our games and services 

we develop market publish and deliver games and services that can be played on a variety of platforms including consoles pcs mobile phones and tablets we market and sell our games and services through digital distribution channels and through retail channels we believe that flexibility across platforms distribution channels and business models is critical to maintaining and growing our player base as well as increasing engagement with our games and services new platforms engagement models and business models are expected to continue to emerge in the future and we intend to evaluate these opportunities on a casebycase basis 

digitally our console games and services can be purchased through thirdparty storefronts such as the digital stores of our console platform partners sony microsoft and nintendo our direct sales to sony and microsoft represented approximately 27 percent  and 16 percent  of total net revenue respectively in fiscal 2018 approximately 19 percent and 17 percent of total net revenue respectively in fiscal 2017 and approximately 16 percent and 14 percent of total net revenue respectively in fiscal 2016 our mobile and tablet games and services are available through thirdparty application storefronts such as the apple app store and google play our pc games and services can be downloaded directly through our origin platform as well as through thirdparty online download stores we also partner with third parties to publish our mobile and pc games and services on their platforms in certain asian territories such as our partnerships with tencent holdings limited and nexon co ltd for fifa online  in china and korea respectively players also can access a selection of our console and pc games and services through our ea access and origin access subscription services our packaged goods games are sold directly to mass market retailers electronics specialty stores and game software specialty stores or through distribution arrangements 

in our games and services we use brands that we either wholly own such as battlefield mass effect need for speed the sims and plants v zombies or license from others such as fifa madden nfl and star wars we develop and publish games and services   across diverse genres such as sports firstperson shooter action roleplaying and simulation  we believe that the breadth and depth of our portfolio gives us the opportunity to engage an increasing number of players across more platforms and geographies and through more business models 

our largest and most popular game is fifa the annualized version of which is consistently one of the bestselling games in the marketplace net revenue from  fifa 18   fifa 17    and fifa 16  represented approximately 11 percent of our total net revenue in fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

within our games we offer live services including microtransactions downloadable content subscriptions and esports that provide additional depth and engagement opportunities for our players our live services net revenue comprised 40 of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2018 and we expect that live services net revenue will continue to be material to our business our most popular live service is the  ultimate team  mode associated with our sports franchises  ultimate team  allows 

players to collect and trade current and former professional players in order to build and compete as a personalized team net revenue from ultimate team represented approximately 21 percent 16 percent and 15 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively a substantial portion of which was derived from fifa ultimate team  

we also are investing in a number of longterm initiatives that we believe will allow us to better serve and deepen our engagement with our players such as our focus on esports through our competitive gaming division we believe that the interest and enthusiasm that surrounds esports will drive sales of our games and engagement with our live services in addition to providing revenue through partnerships with sponsors and broadcasters 

significant relationships 

sony  microsoft  under the terms of agreements we have entered into with sony computer entertainment inc and its affiliates and with microsoft corporation and its affiliates we are authorized to develop and distribute discbased and digitallydelivered software products and services compatible with playstation and xbox consoles respectively under these agreements with sony and microsoft we are provided with the nonexclusive right to use for a fixed term and in a designated territory technology that is owned or licensed by them to publish our games on their respective platform with respect to our digitallydelivered products and services the console manufacturers pay us either a wholesale price or a “royalty” percentage on the revenue they derive from their sales of our products and services our transactions for packaged goods products are made pursuant to individual purchase orders which are accepted on a caseby case basis by sony or microsoft or their designated replicators as the case may be for packaged goods products we pay the console manufacturers a perunit royalty for each unit manufactured many key commercial terms of our relationships with sony and microsoft — such as manufacturing terms delivery times platform policies and approval conditions — are determined unilaterally and are subject to change by the console manufacturers 

the platform license agreements also require us to indemnify the console manufacturers for any loss liability and expense resulting from any claim against the console manufacturer regarding our games and services including any claims for patent copyright or trademark infringement brought against the console manufacturer each platform license may be terminated by the console manufacturer if a breach or default by us is not cured after we receive written notice from the console manufacturer or if we become insolvent the console manufacturers are not obligated to enter into platform license agreements with us for any future consoles products or services 

apple google and other app stores  we have agreements to distribute our mobile applications and additional content through distributors such as apple and google our applications are downloaded for mobile devices from third party application storefronts the distributor charges consumers for content purchased within the application or charges consumers a onetime fee to download the application our distribution agreements establish the amounts that are retained by the distributor and the amounts passed through to us these arrangements are typically terminable on short notice the agreements generally do not obligate the distributors to market or distribute any of our applications 

publishing partners in asia  we have entered into agreements whereby we partner with certain companies including tencent holdings limited and nexon co ltd or their respective affiliates pursuant to which these companies publish our mobile and pc freetodownload games in certain asian territories including china and korea our players access games from the publishers’ platforms and are charged for additional content purchased within our game environment the agreements generally establish the amounts that are retained by the publisher and the amounts passed through to us 

competition 

the market for interactive entertainment is intensely competitive and changes rapidly as new products and platforms are introduced we also face competition for the right to use certain intellectual property included in our products we face significant competition from companies such as activision blizzard taketwo interactive ubisoft bethesda epic games tencent sony and microsoft primarily with respect to developing games and services that operate on consoles pcs andor mobile devices 

more broadly we compete against providers of different sources of entertainment such as motion pictures television social networking online casual entertainment and music that our players could enjoy in their free time important competitive factors in our industry include game quality and ease of use innovation compatibility of products with certain platforms brand recognition publisher reputation reliability security price marketing and quality of customer service 

intellectual property 

to establish and protect our intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyrights trademarks patents patent applications trade secrets knowhow license agreements confidentiality provisions and procedures and other contractual provisions we actively engage in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property in addition we engage in activities designed to limit the impact of abuse of our digital products and services including monitoring our games for evidence of exploitation and rebalancing our game environments in the event that such abuse is discovered

seasonality 

we have historically experienced the highest percentage of our sales in our third fiscal quarter due to seasonal holiday demand and the launch timing of our games while we expect this trend to continue in fiscal year 2019 there is no assurance that it will in addition we have historically deferred the recognition of a significant amount of net revenue over an extended period of time as a result the quarter in which we generated the highest net bookings has been different from the quarter in which we recognized the highest amount of net revenue asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 which is effective for us at the beginning of fiscal year 2019 will decrease the amount of net revenue that we defer as compared to our historical practices as a result we expect our net revenue and net bookings to align more closely during fiscal year 2019 and beyond 

employees 

as of march 31 2018 we had approximately 9300 regular fulltime employees over 5800 of whom were outside the united states we believe that our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is a critical factor in the successful development of our products and services and that our future success will depend in large measure on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees approximately 9 percent of our employees all of whom work for our dice development studio in sweden are represented by a union

competition in our industry is intense many new products and services are regularly introduced in each major industry segment console mobile and pc but only a relatively small number of “hit” titles account for a significant portion of total revenue in each segment our competitors range from established interactive entertainment companies and diversified media companies to emerging startups and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge throughout the world if our competitors develop and market more successful and engaging products or services offer competitive products or services at lower price points or if we do not continue to develop consistently highquality wellreceived and engaging products and services our revenue margins and profitability will decline 

we maintain a relatively limited product portfolio in an effort to focus on developing highquality and engaging products with the potential to become hits highquality titles even if highlyreviewed may not turn into hit products many hit products within our industry are iterations of prior hit products with large established consumer bases and significant brand recognition which makes competing in certain product categories challenging in addition hit products or services of our competitors may take a larger portion of consumer spending or time than we anticipate which could cause our products and services to underperform relative to our expectations publishing a relatively small number of major titles each year also concentrates risk in those titles and means each major title has greater associated risk a significant portion of our revenue historically has been derived from games and services based on a few popular franchises and the underperformance of a single major title could have a material adverse impact on our financial results for example we have historically derived a significant portion of our net revenue from sales related to our largest and most popular game fifa the annualized version of which is consistently one of the bestselling games in the marketplace any events or circumstances that negatively impact our fifa franchise such as game or service quality the delay or cancellation of a product or service launch or real or perceived security risks could negatively impact our financial results to a disproportionate extent 

the increased importance of live services revenue to our business heightens the risks associated with our limited product portfolio live services that are either poorlyreceived or provided in connection with underperforming games may generate lower than expected sales any lapse delay or failure in our ability to provide highquality live services content to consumers over an extended period of time could materially and adversely affect our financial results consumer engagement with our live services and cause harm to our reputation and brand our most popular live service is the ultimate team mode associated with our sports franchises any events or circumstances that negatively impact our ability to reliably provide content or sustain engagement for ultimate team  particularly fifa ultimate team  would negatively impact our financial results to a disproportionate extent   

technology changes rapidly in our business and we may fail to anticipate or   successfully implement new technologies or adopt new business strategies technologies or methods 

rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate sometimes years in advance which technologies we must develop implement and take advantage of in order to make our products and services competitive in the market we have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies technologies products and services for example we are investing in the infrastructure for our ea player network which we expect will allow us to market and deliver content and services for our franchises more efficiently as well as enable new playercentric ways to discover and try new experiences such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the technology we choose to adopt and the products and services that we pursue will be successful if we do not successfully implement these new technologies our reputation and brand may be materially adversely affected and our financial condition and operating results may be impacted we also may miss opportunities to adopt technology or develop products services or new ways to engage with our games that become popular with consumers which could adversely affect our financial results it may take significant time and resources to shift our focus to such technologies putting us at a competitive disadvantage 

our development process usually starts with particular platforms and distribution methods in mind and a range of technical development and feature goals that we hope to be able to achieve we may not be able to achieve these goals or our competition 

may be able to achieve them more quickly and effectively than we can in either case our products and services may be technologically inferior to those of our competitors less appealing to consumers or both if we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule for our products and services then we may delay their release until these goals can be achieved which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses alternatively we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies either to preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up with our competition which would increase our development expenses 

we may experience security breaches and cyber threats 

our industry is prone to and our systems and networks are subject to cyberattacks computer viruses worms phishing attacks malicious software programs and other information security incidents that seek to exploit disable damage disrupt or gain access to our networks our products and services supporting technological infrastructure intellectual property and other assets we expect these threats to our systems and networks to continue in addition we rely on technological infrastructure provided by thirdparty business partners to support the online functionality of our products and services these business partners as well as our channel partners also are subject to cyber risks and threats both our partners and we have expended and expect to continue to expend financial and operational resources to implement certain systems processes and technologies to guard against cyber risks and to help protect our data and systems however the techniques used to exploit disable damage disrupt or gain access to our networks our products and services supporting technological infrastructure intellectual property and other assets change frequently continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and often are not detected for long periods of time our systems processes and technologies and the systems processes and technologies of our business partners may not be adequate against all eventualities in addition the costs to respond to mitigate andor notify affected parties of cyberattacks and other security vulnerabilities are significant any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or cyber risks or detect or respond adequately to a security breach or cyber risk could result in a loss of anticipated revenue interruptions to our products and services cause us to incur significant remediation and notification costs degrade the user experience cause consumers to lose confidence in our products and services and significant legal and financial costs this could harm our business reputation and brand disrupt our relationships with partners and customers and diminish our competitive position 

the virtual economies that we have established in many of our games are subject to abuse exploitation and other forms of fraudulent activity that can negatively impact our business virtual economies involve the use of virtual currency andor virtual assets that can be used or redeemed by a player within a particular game or service the abuse or exploitation of our virtual economies include the illegitimate generation and sale of virtual items including in black markets our online services have been impacted by ingame exploits and the use of automated or other fraudulent processes to generate virtual item or currency illegitimately and such activity may continue these abuses and exploits and the steps that we take to address these abuses and exploits may result in a loss of anticipated revenue increased costs to protect against or remediate these issues interfere with players’ enjoyment of a balanced game environment and cause harm to our reputation and brand 

our business could be adversely affected if our consumer protection data privacy and security practices are not adequate or perceived as being inadequate to prevent data breaches or by the application of consumer protection and data privacy and security laws generally 

in the course of our business we collect process store and use consumer employee and other information including personal information passwords credit card information gameplay details and banking information although we expend and expect to continue to expend financial and operational resources to create and enforce security measures policies and controls that are designed to protect this information from improper or unauthorized access acquisition and misuse andor the uninformed disclosure our security measures policies and controls may not be able successful against all eventualities the improper or unauthorized access acquisition or misuse andor uninformed disclosure of consumer and other information or a perception that we do not adequately secure this information or provide consumers with adequate notice about the information that they authorize us to disclose could result in legal liability costly remedial measures governmental and regulatory investigations harm our profitability reputation and brand and cause our financial results to be materially affected in addition third party vendors and business partners receive access to information that we collect these vendors and business partners may not prevent data security breaches with respect to the information we provide them or fully enforce our policies contractual obligations and disclosures regarding the collection use storage transfer and retention of personal data a data security breach of one of our vendors or business partners could cause reputational and financial harm to them and us negatively impact our ability to offer our products and services and could result in legal liability costly remedial measures governmental and regulatory investigations harm our profitability reputation and brand and cause our financial results to be materially affected 

we are subject to payment card association rules and obligations pursuant to contracts with payment card processors under these rules and obligations if information is compromised we could be liable to payment card issuers for the cost of associated expenses and penalties in addition if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards even if no consumer information is compromised we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs 

data privacy data protection localization security and consumerprotection laws are evolving and the interpretation and application of these laws in the united states europe and elsewhere often are uncertain contradictory and changing for example recent developments in europe have created compliance uncertainty and increased the complexity of certain transfers of information from europe to the united states in addition the european general data protection regulation gdpr effective as of may 2018 applies to us because we receive and process the personal data of european union residents the gdpr contains significant penalties for noncompliance it is possible that these laws may be interpreted or applied in a manner that is adverse to us unforeseen or otherwise inconsistent with our practices or that we may not adequately adapt our internal policies andor procedures to evolving regulations any of which could result in litigation regulatory investigations and potential legal liability require us to change our practices in a manner adverse to our business or limit access to our products and services in certain countries as a result our reputation and brand may be harmed we could incur substantial costs and we could lose both consumers and revenue 

we may experience outages disruptions or degradations in our services products andor technological infrastructure 

the reliable performance of our products and services increasingly depends on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology systems and those of our external service providers including thirdparty “cloud” computing services our games and services are complex software products and maintaining the sophisticated technological infrastructure required to reliably deliver these games and services is expensive and complex the reliable delivery and stability of our products and services could be adversely impacted by outages disruptions failures or degradations in our network and related infrastructure as well as in the online platforms or services of key business partners who offer or support our products and services possible causes of these outages disruptions failures or degradations include natural disasters power loss terrorism cyberattacks computer viruses bugs or other malware or ransomware that may harm our systems in addition we occasionally migrate data among data centers and to thirdparty hosted environments and perform upgrades and maintenance on our systems 

if we were to experience an event that caused a significant system outage disruption or degradation or if a transition among data centers or service providers or an upgrade or maintenance session encountered unexpected interruptions unforeseen complexity or unplanned disruptions our products and services may not be available to consumers or may not be delivered reliably and stably as a result our reputation and brand may be harmed consumer engagement with our products and services may be reduced and our revenue and profitability could be negatively impacted we do not have redundancy for all our systems many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities 

as our digital business grows we will require an increasing amount of technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy the needs of consumers we are investing and expect to continue to invest in technology hardware and software to support our business but it is possible that we may fail to scale effectively and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands which may adversely affect the reliable and stable performance of our games and services therefore negatively impacting engagement reputation brand and revenue growth 

negative perceptions about and responses to our brands products services andor business practices may damage our business and we may incur costs to address concerns 

expectations regarding the quality performance and integrity of our products and services are high players may be critical of our brands products services business models andor business practices for a wide variety of reasons including perceptions about gameplay fun fairness game content features or services or objections to certain of our business practices these negative responses may not be foreseeable we also may not effectively manage these responses because of reasons within or outside of our control for example we have included in certain games the ability for players to purchase digital items including in some instances virtual “packs” “boxes” or “crates” that contain variable digital items the inclusion of variable digital items in certain of our games has attracted the attention of our community and if the future implementation of these features creates a negative perception of gameplay fairness or other negative perceptions our reputation and brand could be harmed and our revenue could be negatively impacted in addition we have taken actions including delaying the release of our games and delaying or discontinuing features and services for our games after taking into consideration among other things feedback from our community even if those decisions negatively impacted our operating results in the short term we expect to continue to take actions to address concerns as appropriate including actions that may result in additional expenditures and the loss of revenue negative sentiment about gameplay fairness our business practices business models or game content also can lead to investigations or increased scrutiny from governmental bodies and consumer groups as well as litigation which regardless of their outcome may be costly damaging to our reputation and harm our business 

our business depends on the success and availability of platforms developed by third parties and our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for those platforms 

the success of our business is driven in part by the commercial success and adequate supply of third party platforms for which we develop our products and services or through which our products and services are distributed our success also depends on our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be successful in the marketplace our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for these platforms our ability to simultaneously manage products and services on multiple platforms and our ability to effectively transition our products and services to new platforms we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of the commercial availability of new platforms and we may incur significant expense to adjust our product portfolio and development efforts in response to changing consumer platform preferences additionally we may enter into certain exclusive licensing arrangements that affect our ability to deliver or market products or services on certain platforms a platform for which we are developing products and services may not succeed as expected or new platforms may take market share and interactive entertainment consumers away from platforms for which we have devoted significant resources if consumer demand for the platforms for which we are developing products and services is lower than our expectations we may be unable to fully recover the investments we have made in developing our products and services and our financial performance will be harmed alternatively a platform for which we have not devoted significant resources could be more successful than we initially anticipated causing us to not be able to take advantage of meaningful revenue opportunities 

government regulations applicable to us may negatively impact our business 

we are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet in addition laws and regulations relating to user privacy data collection retention consumer protection content advertising localization and information security have been adopted or are being considered for adoption by many jurisdictions and countries throughout the world these laws could harm our business by limiting the products and services we can offer consumers or the manner in which we offer them the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation any failure on our part to comply with these laws or the application of these laws in an unanticipated manner may harm our business and result in penalties or significant legal liability 

certain of our business models could be subject to new laws or regulations or evolving interpretations of existing laws and regulations for example the growth and development of electronic commerce virtual items and virtual currency has prompted calls for laws and regulations that could limit or restrict the sale of our products and services or otherwise impact our products and services in addition we include modes in our games that allow players to compete against each other and manage player competitions that are based on our products and services although we structure and operate our skillbased competitions with applicable laws in mind our skillbased competitions in the future could become subject to evolving laws and regulations new laws related to these business models or changes in the interpretation of current laws that impact these business models could subject us to additional regulation and oversight lessen the engagement with and growth of profitable business models and expose us to increased compliance costs significant liability penalties and harm to our reputation and brand 

we are subject to laws in certain foreign countries and adhere to industry standards in the united states that mandate rating requirements or set other restrictions on the advertisement or distribution of interactive entertainment software based on content in addition certain foreign countries allow government censorship of interactive entertainment software products adoption of ratings systems censorship or restrictions on distribution of interactive entertainment software based on content could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers in addition compliance with new and possibly inconsistent regulations for different territories could be costly delay or prevent the release of our products in those territories 

we may not meet our product development schedules or key events sports seasons andor movies that are tied to our product release schedule to may be delayed cancelled or poorly received 

our ability to meet product development schedules is affected by a number of factors both within and outside our control including feedback from our players the creative processes involved the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams the complexity of our products and the platforms for which they are developed the need to finetune our products prior to their release and in certain cases approvals from third parties we have experienced development delays for our products in the past which caused us to delay or cancel release dates we also seek to release certain products in conjunction with key events such as the beginning of a sports season major sporting event or the release of a related movie if such a key event were delayed cancelled or poorly received our sales likely would suffer materially any failure to meet anticipated production or release schedules likely would result in a delay of revenue andor possibly a significant shortfall in our revenue increase our development andor marketing expenses harm our profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different than anticipated 

historically our business has been highly seasonal with the highest percentage of our sales occurring in the quarter ending in december while we expect this trend to continue in fiscal year 2019 there is no assurance that it will be so if we miss key selling periods for products or services for any reason including product delays or product cancellations our sales likely will suffer significantly additionally macroeconomic conditions or the occurrence of unforeseen events that negatively impact consumer or retailer buying patterns particularly during the quarter ending in december likely will harm our financial performance disproportionately 

our marketing and advertising efforts may fail to resonate with consumers 

our products and services are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs such as online and mobile advertising television advertising retail merchandising marketing through websites event sponsorship and direct communications with consumers including via email furthermore an increasing portion of our marketing activity is taking place on social media platforms that are outside of our direct control our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part upon the success of these programs and changes to consumer preferences marketing regulations technology changes or service disruptions may negatively impact our ability to reach our customers moreover if the marketing for our products and services fails to resonate with our customers particularly during the critical holiday season or during other key selling periods or if advertising rates or other media placement costs increase our business and operating results could be harmed 

we may not attract and retain key personnel 

the market for technical creative marketing and other personnel essential to the development marketing and support of our products and services and management of our businesses is extremely competitive our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting our executives as well as key creative and technical talent we may experience significant compensation costs to hire and retain senior executives and other personnel that we deem critical to our success if we cannot successfully recruit and retain qualified employees or replace key employees following their departure our ability to develop and manage our business will be impaired 

we may experience declines or fluctuations in the recurring portion of our business 

our business model includes revenue that we deem recurring in nature such as revenue from our annualized titles eg fifa and madden nfl and associated services subscriptions and our ongoing mobile businesses while we have been able to forecast the revenue from these areas of our business with greater relative confidence than for new games services and business models we cannot provide assurances that consumer demand will remain consistent furthermore we may cease to offer games and services that we previously had deemed to be recurring in nature consumer demand may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their level of satisfaction with our games and services our ability to improve and innovate our annualized titles our ability to adapt our games and services to new platforms and business models outages and disruptions of online services the games and services offered by our competitors our marketing and advertising efforts or declines in consumer activity generally as a result of economic downturns among others the reception to our licensed sports games may be adversely impacted by circumstances outside our control impacting the sports leagues and organizations any decline or fluctuation in the recurring portion of our business may have a negative impact on our financial and operating results 

we could fail to successfully adopt new business models 

from time to time we seek to establish and implement new business models forecasting the success of any new business model is inherently uncertain and depends on a number of factors both within and outside of our control our actual revenue and profit for these businesses may be significantly greater or less than our forecasts in addition these new business models could fail resulting in the loss of our investment in the development and infrastructure needed to support these new business models as well as the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from more successful and established businesses for example we have devoted financial and operational resources to our subscription offerings without any assurance that these businesses will be financially successful while we anticipate growth in this area of our business consumer demand is difficult to predict as a result of a number of factors including satisfaction with our products and services our ability to provide engaging products and services products and services offered by our competitors reliability of our infrastructure pricing the actual or perceived security of our information technology systems and reductions in consumer spending levels in addition if our subscription offerings are successful sales could be diverted from established business models if we do not select a target price that is optimal for our subscription services maintain our target pricing structure or correctly project renewal rates our financial results may be harmed 

acquisitions investments divestitures and other strategic transactions could result in   operating difficulties and other negative   consequences 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions including 1 acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets 2 minority investments in strategic partners and 3 investments in new interactive entertainment businesses as part of our longterm business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment that we acquire liabilities that our due diligence process does not identify significant issues liabilities or other challenges diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses in addition we may not integrate these businesses successfully for example with difficulties with the integration of business systems and technologies the integration and retention of new employees the implementation or remediation of the internal control environment of the acquired entity or the maintenance of key business and customer relationships these events could harm our operating results or financial condition we also may divest or sell assets or a business and we may have difficulty selling such assets or business on acceptable terms in a timely manner this could result in a delay in the achievement of our strategic objectives cause us to incur additional expense or the sale of such assets or business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we anticipated 

we may be unable to maintain or acquire licenses to include intellectual property owned by others in our games or to maintain or acquire the rights to publish or distribute games developed by others 

many of our products and services are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our ea sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players’ associations and our star wars products include rights licensed from disney competition for these licenses and rights is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses and rights or obtain additional licenses or rights with significant commercial value our ability to develop and successful and engaging games and services may be adversely affected and our revenue profitability and cash flows may decline significantly competition for these licenses also may increase the amounts that we must pay to licensors and developers through higher minimum guarantees or royalty rates which could significantly increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

we rely on the platforms of our channel partners who have significant influence over the products and services that we offer on their platforms 

a significant percentage of our digital net revenue is attributable to sales of products and services through our significant channel partners including sony microsoft nintendo apple and google the concentration of a material portion of our digital sales in these channel partners exposes us to risks associated with these businesses any deterioration in the businesses of our channel partners could disrupt and harm our business including by limiting the channels through which our digital products and services are offered and exposing us to collection risks 

in addition our license agreements with our channel partners typically give them significant control over the approval manufacturing and distribution of the products and services that we develop for their platform in particular our arrangements with sony and microsoft could in certain circumstances leave us unable to get our products and services approved manufactured or distributed to customers for our digital products and services delivered via digital channels maintained by among others sony 

microsoft nintendo apple and google each respective channel partner has policies and guidelines that control the promotion and distribution of these titles and the features and functionalities that we are permitted to offer through the channel in addition we are dependent on our channel partners to invest in and upgrade digital commerce capabilities in a manner than corresponds to the way in which consumers purchase our products and services failure by our channels partners to keep pace with consumer preferences could have an adverse impact on our ability to merchandise and commercialize our products and services which could harm our business andor financial results 

moreover certain of our channel partners can determine and change unilaterally certain key terms and conditions including the ability to change their user and developer policies and guidelines in many cases our channel partners also set the rates that we must pay to provide our games and services through their online channels and retain flexibility to change their fee structures or adopt different fee structures for their online channels which could adversely impact our costs profitability and margins in addition our channel partners control the information technology systems through which online sales of our products and service channels are captured if our channel partners establish terms that restrict our offerings through their channels significantly impact the financial terms on which these products or services are offered to our customers or their information technology systems fail or cause an unanticipated delay in reporting our business andor financial results could be materially affected 

our business is subject to risks generally associated with the entertainment industry 

our business is subject to risks that are generally associated with the entertainment industry many of which are beyond our control these risks could negatively impact our operating results and include the popularity price and timing of our games economic conditions that adversely affect discretionary consumer spending changes in consumer demographics the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted 

our business partners may be unable to honor their obligations to us or their actions may put us at risk 

we rely on various business partners including thirdparty service providers vendors licensing partners development partners and licensees in many areas of our business their actions may put our business and our reputation and brand at risk for example we may have disputes with our business partners that may impact our business andor financial results in many cases our business partners may be given access to sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support to our teams and they may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it in addition the failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies or the failure of the third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies could result in a disruption to our business operations further disruptions in the financial markets economic downturns poor business decisions or reputational harm may adversely affect our business partners and they may not be able to continue honoring their obligations to us or we may cease our arrangements with them alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner or vendor if we lose one or more significant business partners our business could be harmed and our financial results could be materially affected 

the products or services we release may contain defects bugs or errors 

our products and services are extremely complex software programs and are difficult to develop and distribute we have quality controls in place to detect defects bugs or other errors in our products and services before they are released nonetheless these quality controls are subject to human error overriding and reasonable resource or technical constraints therefore these quality controls and preventative measures may not be effective in detecting all defects bugs or errors in our products and services before they have been released into the marketplace in such an event the technological reliability and stability of our products and services could be below our standards and the standards of consumers and our reputation brand and sales could be adversely affected in addition we could be required to or may find it necessary to offer a refund for the product or service suspend the availability or sale of the product or service or expend significant resources to cure the defect bug or error each of which could significantly harm our business and operating results 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights 

from time to time third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights for example patent holding companies may assert patent claims against us in which they seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained although we take steps to avoid knowingly violating the intellectual property rights of others it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement 

existing or future infringement claims against us whether valid or not may be expensive to defend and divert the attention of our employees from business operations such claims or litigation could require us to pay damages and other costs we also could be required to stop selling distributing or supporting products features or services which incorporate the affected intellectual property rights redesign products features or services to avoid infringement or obtain a license all of which could be costly and harm our business 

in addition many patents have been issued that may apply to potential new modes of delivering playing or monetizing interactive entertainment software products and services such as those that we produce or would like to offer in the future we may discover that future opportunities to provide new and innovative modes of game play and game delivery to consumers may be precluded by existing patents that we are unable to license on reasonable terms 

from time to time we may become involved in other legal proceedings 

we are currently and from time to time in the future may become subject to legal proceedings claims litigation and government investigations or inquiries which could be expensive lengthy disruptive to normal business operations and occupy a significant amount of our employees’ time and attention in addition the outcome of any legal proceedings claims litigation investigations or inquiries may be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

our products and brands are subject to the threat of piracy unauthorized copying and other forms of intellectual property infringement 

we regard our products and brands as proprietary and take measures to protect our products brands and other confidential information from infringement we are aware that some unauthorized copying of our products and brands occurs and if a significantly greater amount were to occur it could negatively impact our business 

piracy and other forms of unauthorized copying and use of our content and brands are persistent problems for us and policing is difficult further the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be distributed either do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states or are poorly enforced legal protection of our rights may be ineffective in such countries in addition although we take steps to enforce and police our rights factors such as   the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures used by our business partners or by us the availability of broadband access to the internet the refusal of internet service providers or platform holders to remove infringing content in certain instances and the proliferation of online channels through which infringing product is distributed all have contributed to an expansion in unauthorized copying of our products and brands 

we may experience outages disruptions andor degradations of our infrastructure 

we may experience outrages disruptions andor degradations of our infrastructure including information technology system failures and network disruptions these may be caused by natural disasters cyberincidents weather events power disruptions telecommunications failures failed upgrades of existing systems or migrations to new systems acts of terrorism or other events including cyberattacks or malicious software programs that exploit vulnerabilities system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could prevent access to our products services or online stores selling our products and services or interruption in our ability to conduct critical business functions our corporate headquarters in redwood city ca and our studios in los angeles california seattle washington and in burnaby british columbia are located in seismically active regions and certain of our game development activities and other essential business operations are conducted at these locations an event that results in the disruption or degradation of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and materially impact our reputation and brand financial condition and operating results 

a significant portion of our packaged goods sales are made to a relatively small number of   retail and distribution partners and these sales may be disrupted 

we derive a significant percentage of our net revenue attributable to sales of our packaged goods products to our top retail and distribution partners the concentration of a significant percentage of these sales through a few large partners could lead to a shortterm disruption to our business if certain of these partners significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to offer our products we also could be more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these partners experienced a deterioration of their business or declared bankruptcy additionally receivables from these partners generally increase in our december fiscal quarter as sales of our products generally increase in anticipation of the holiday season having a significant portion of our packaged goods sales 

concentrated in a few partners could reduce our negotiating leverage with them if one or more of these partners experience deterioration in their business or become unable to obtain sufficient financing to maintain their operations our business could be harmed 

external game developers may not meet product development schedules or otherwise honor their obligations 

we may contract with external game developers to develop our games or to publish or distribute their games while we maintain contractual protections we have less control over the product development schedules of games developed by external developers and we depend on their ability to meet product development schedules in addition we may have disputes with external developers over game content launch timing achievement of certain milestones the game development timeline marketing campaigns or other matters if we have disputes with external developers or they cannot meet product development schedules acquire certain approvals or are otherwise unable or unwilling to honor their obligations to us we may delay or cancel previously announced games alter our launch schedule or experience increased costs and expenses which could result in a delay or significant shortfall in anticipated revenue harm our profitability and reputation and cause our financial results to be materially affected 

our financial results are subject to currency fluctuations 

international sales are a fundamental part of our business for our fiscal year ended march 31 2018 international net revenue comprised 59 percent of our total net revenue and we expect our international business to continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue as a result of our international sales and also the denomination of our foreign investments and our cash and cash equivalents in foreign currencies we are exposed to the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates strengthening of the us dollar particularly relative to the euro british pound sterling australian dollar chinese yuan and south korean won has a negative impact on our reported international net revenue but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses particularly when the us dollar strengthens against the swedish krona and the canadian dollar because these amounts are translated at lower rates we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency risk however these activities are limited in the protection they provide us from foreign currency fluctuations and can themselves result in losses 

we utilize debt financing and such indebtedness could adversely impact our business and financial condition 

we have 1 billion in senior unsecured notes outstanding as well as an unsecured committed 500 million revolving credit facility while the facility is currently undrawn we may use the proceeds of any future borrowings for general corporate purposes we may also enter into other financial instruments in the future 

our indebtedness could affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

 

 

 

the agreements governing our indebtedness impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants in particular the revolving credit facility includes a maximum capitalization ratio and minimum liquidity requirements our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of these covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities as well as the potential costs associated with any potential refinancing our indebtedness downgrades in our credit rating could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision tax assets and accruals for other taxes and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective income tax rate is based in part on our corporate operating structure and the manner in which we operate our business and develop value and use our intellectual property taxing authorities in 

jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for calculating our income tax provision or its underlying assumptions which could increase our effective income tax rate and have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows in addition our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our profit levels changes in our business changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the elections we make changes in applicable tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws or changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as well as other factors 

the tax cuts and jobs act the “us tax act” enacted on december 22 2017 represents a significant overhaul to the us federal tax code this tax legislation lowers the us statutory tax rate but also includes a number of provisions that could significantly and adversely impact our us federal income tax position in a reporting period including the limitation or elimination of certain deductions or credits and us taxes on foreign earnings the final calculation of tax expense resulting from the us tax act may differ from our estimates potentially materially in addition any further changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals in the countries in which we do business could adversely affect our effective tax rates cause us to change the way in which we structure our business or result in other costs 

we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions furthermore we are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities with respect to both income and such other nonincome taxes unfavorable audit results or tax rulings or other changes resulting in significant additional tax liabilities could have material adverse effects upon our earnings cash flows and financial condition 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in   financial accounting standards 

our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting standards promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies these methods estimates and judgments are subject to risks uncertainties assumptions and changes that could adversely affect our reported financial position and financial results in addition changes to applicable financial accounting standards could adversely affect our reported financial position and financial results for example asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 which is effective for us at the beginning of fiscal 2019 will materially change the way in which we recognize revenue and will require us to change how we report mobile platform fees for more information on asu 201409 and other accounting standards see part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 1  description of business and basis of presentation under the subheading “impact of recently issued accounting standards” 

as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue costs and taxes could have an adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors above as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts’ earnings estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts’ and investors’ expectations to factors affecting the entertainment computer software internet media or electronics industries to our ability to successfully integrate any acquisitions we may make or to national or international economic conditions in particular economic downturns may contribute to the public stock markets experiencing extreme price and trading volume volatility these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings 

on july 29 2010 michael davis a former nfl running back filed a putative class action in the united states district court for the northern district of california against the company alleging that certain past versions of madden nfl  included the images of certain retired nfl players without their permission in march 2012 the trial court denied the company’s request to dismiss the complaint on first amendment grounds in january 2015 that trial court decision was affirmed by the ninth circuit court of appeals and the case was remanded back to the united states district court for the northern district of california where the case is pending 

we are also subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we do not believe that any liability from any reasonably foreseeable disposition of such claims and litigation individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following overview is a highlevel discussion of our operating results as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers provides important context for our results for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form 10k including in the “business” section and the “risk factors” above the remainder of this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda”” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

about electronic arts 

we are a global leader in digital interactive entertainment with a mission to inspire the world to play we develop market publish and deliver games and services that can be played on a variety of platforms including game consoles pcs mobile phones and tablets in our games and services we use brands that we either wholly own such as battlefield mass effect the sims and plants v zombies or license from others such as fifa madden nfl and star wars we develop and publish games and services across diverse genres such as sports firstperson shooter action roleplaying and simulation we believe that the breadth and depth of our portfolio gives us the opportunity to engage an increasing number of players across more platforms and geographies and through more business models 

financial results 

our key financial results for our fiscal year ended march 31 2018  were as follows 

 

from time to time we make comparisons of current periods to prior periods with reference to constant currency constant currency comparisons are based on translating local currency amounts in the current period at actual foreign exchange rates from the prior comparable period we evaluate our financial performance on a constant currency basis in order to facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons without regard to the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates 

trends in our business 

digital business  players increasingly purchase our games as digital downloads as opposed to purchasing physical discs and engage with the live services we provide on an ongoing basis our live services provide additional depth and engagement opportunities for our players and include microtransactions extra content subscriptions and esports our net revenue attributable to live services comprised 40 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2018 and we expect that live services net revenue will continue to be material to our business our most popular live service is the ultimate team  mode associated with our sports franchises ultimate team  allows players to collect and trade current and former professional players in order to build and compete as a personalized team net revenue from ultimate team  represented approximately 21 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2018 a substantial portion of which was derived from fifa ultimate team  our digital transformation is also creating opportunities in platforms business models and the way in which players engage with our games and services for example we have leveraged brands and assets from franchises typically associated with consoles and traditional pc gaming such as fifa madden nfl the sims simcity and star wars to create mobile and pc games that are monetized through live services associated with the game we also provide our ea access and origin access subscription services which offer players access to a selection of ea games and other benefits for a monthly or annual fee 

we significantly increased our digital net revenue from 2409 million in fiscal year 2016 to 2874 million in fiscal year 2017 and 3450 million during fiscal year 2018 we expect this portion of our business to continue to grow through fiscal year 2019 and beyond as we continue to focus on developing and monetizing products and services that can be delivered digitally 

technological infrastructure as our digital business has grown our games and services increasingly depend on the reliability availability and security of our technological infrastructure we are investing and expect to continue to invest in technology hardware and software to support our games and services including with respect to security protections our industry is prone to and our systems and networks are subject to cyberattacks computer viruses worms phishing attacks malicious software programs and other information security incidents that seek to exploit disable damage disrupt or gain access to our networks our products and services supporting technological infrastructure intellectual property and other assets we expect these threats to our systems and networks to continue 

player network  we have made and expect to continue to make investments that strengthen our player network which connects our players to each other and to the games they love we are adopting consistent crosscompany methodologies to better understand our players’ needs and will continue to invest in technology that enables us to build personalized player relationships that can last for years instead of days or weeks by connecting our players to us and to each other this connection allows us to market and deliver content and services for popular franchises like fifa battlefield and star wars to our players more efficiently that same foundation also enables new playercentric ways to discover and try new games and experiences such as our subscriptionbased ea access and origin access services 

concentration of sales among the most popular games  in all major segments of our industry we see a large portion of games sales concentrated on the most popular titles similarly a significant portion of our revenue historically has been derived from games based on a few popular franchises several of which we have released on an annual or biannual basis in particular we have historically derived a significant portion of our net revenue from our largest and most popular game fifa the annualized version of which is consistently one of the bestselling games in the marketplace 

mobile and pc freetodownload games  the global adoption of mobile devices and a business model for those devices that allows consumers to try new games with no upfront cost and that are monetized through the live service associated with the game has led to significant growth in the mobile gaming industry we expect this growth to continue during our 2019 fiscal year likewise the wide consumer acceptance of freetodownload live servicebased pc games played over the internet has broadened our consumer base we expect revenue generated from mobile and pc freetodownload games to remain an important part of our business 

recurring revenue sources our business model includes revenue that we deem recurring in nature such as revenue from our annualized titles such as fifa and madden nfl and associated live services subscriptions and our ongoing mobile business we have been able to forecast revenue from these areas of our business with greater relative confidence than for new games services and business models as we continue to leverage the digital transformation in our industry and incorporate new content models and modalities of play into our games our goal is to continue to look for opportunities to expand the recurring portion of our business 

net bookings  in order to improve transparency into our business we disclose an operating performance metric net bookings net bookings is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or soldin physically in the period net 

bookings is calculated by adding total net revenue to the change in deferred net revenue for onlineenabled games and for periods after the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 excluding mobile platform fees 

the following is a calculation of our total net bookings for the periods presented 



net bookings were 5180 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018 driven by fifa 18  fifa ultimate team  star wars battlefront ii  and madden nfl 18  net bookings increased 238 million or 5 percent as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2017 due primarily to growth in bookings associated with the ultimate team  game mode digital net bookings were 3538 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018 an increase of 504 million or 17 percent as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2017 the increase in digital net bookings was driven by growth in live services which grew 514 million or 31 percent yearoveryear primarily due to growth in bookings associated with the ultimate team  game mode and sales of the sims 4  and our mobile business which grew 31 million or 5 percent yearoveryear primarily due to fifa mobile  these increases were offset by a decrease of 41 million or 6 percent in our full game downloads full game downloads of fifa 18  showed strength in fiscal 2018 but were offset by the success of battlefield 1  in fiscal 2017 

     recent developments 

stock repurchase program  in may 2018 a special committee of our board of directors on behalf of the full board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 24 billion of our common stock this stock repurchase program supersedes and replaces the stock repurchase program approved in may 2017 and expires on may 31 2020 under this program we may purchase stock in the open market or through privatelynegotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws including pursuant to prearranged stock trading plans the timing and actual amount of the stock repurchases will depend on several factors including price capital availability regulatory requirements alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions we are not obligated to repurchase a specific number of shares under this program and it may be modified suspended or discontinued at any time we are actively repurchasing shares under this program 

acquisition of respawn llc  on december 1 2017 we completed the acquisition of respawn respawn is a leading game development studio and creators of games including the criticallyacclaimed titanfall franchise in connection with the acquisition we paid 151 million in cash in addition we granted longterm equity awards in the form of restricted stock units to employees with a grant date fair value of 167 million furthermore we may be required to pay variable cash consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance milestones relating to the development of future titles through the end of calendar 2022 the additional consideration is limited to a maximum of 140 million 

us tax act  on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “us tax act” was enacted which significantly revised the us corporate income tax system by among other things lowering the us corporate income tax rates to 21 percent generally implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime transition tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries the “transition tax” we recorded a provisional 235 million tax charge during the year ended march 31 2018 as a result of the application of the us tax act 192 million of which relates to the transition tax 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities contingent assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown as a result actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

revenue recognition and  sales returns and allowances 

we derive revenue principally from sales of interactive software games and related content and services on game consoles pcs mobile phones and tablets we evaluate revenue recognition based on the criteria set forth in fasb accounting standards codification “asc” 605 revenue recognition and asc 985605 software revenue recognition  we classify our revenue as either product revenue or service and other revenue 

product revenue  our product revenue includes revenue associated with the sale of software games or related product content or updates whether delivered digitally  eg  fullgame downloads extracontent or via a physical disc  e  g  packaged goods and licensing of game software to thirdparties product revenue also includes revenue from mobile full game downloads that do not require our hosting support  eg  premium mobile games in order to utilize the game or related content  ie  can be played with or without an internet connection and sales of tangible products such as hardware peripherals or collectors’ items 

service and other revenue  our service revenue includes revenue recognized from timebased subscriptions games content or updates that requires our hosting support in order to utilize the game or related content  ie  can only be played with an internet connection this includes 1 entitlements to content that are accessed through hosting services  eg  microtransactions for internetbased social network and freetodownload mobile games 2 massively multiplayer online “mmo” games both software game and subscription sales 3 subscriptions for our battlefield premium ea and origin access and pogobranded online game services and 4 allocated service revenue from sales of software games with a service of online activities  eg  online playability our other revenue includes advertising and nonsoftware licensing revenue 

with respect to the allocated service revenue from sales of software games with a service of online activities “online services” mentioned above our allocation of proceeds between product and service revenue for presentation purposes is based on management’s best estimate of the selling price of the online services with the residual value allocated to product revenue our estimate of the selling price of the online services are comprised of several factors including but not limited to prior selling prices for the online services prices charged separately by other thirdparty vendors for similar service offerings and a costplusmargin approach we review the estimated selling price of the online services on a regular basis and use this methodology consistently to allocate revenue between product and service for software game sales with online services 

we evaluate and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met 

 

 

 

 

onlineenabled games 

the majority of our software games and related content have online connectivity whereby a consumer may be able to download unspecified content or updates on a whenandifavailable basis “unspecified updates” for use with the original game software in addition we may also offer a service of online activities eg online playability without a separate fee us gaap requires us to account for the consumer’s right to receive unspecified updates or the service of online activities for no additional fee as a “bundled” sale or multipleelement arrangement 

we have an established historical pattern of providing unspecified updates  eg  player roster updates to madden nfl 18  to onlineenabled games and related content at no additional charge to the consumer because we do not have vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” for these unspecified updates we are required by current us gaap to recognize as 

revenue the entire sales price of these onlineenabled games and related content over the period we expect to offer the unspecified updates to the consumer “estimated offering period” 

estimated offering period 

because the offering period is not an explicitly defined period we must make an estimate of the offering period determining the estimated offering period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage for example in determining the estimated offering period for unspecified updates associated with our onlineenabled games we consider the period of time consumers are online as online connectivity is required on an annual basis we review consumers’ online gameplay of all onlineenabled games that have been released 12 to 24 months prior to the evaluation date for example if our evaluation date is april 1 2017 we evaluate all onlineenabled games released between april 1 2015 and march 31 2016 based on this population of games for all players that register the game online within the first six months of release of the game to the general public we compute the weightedaverage number of days for each onlineenabled game based on when a player initially registers the game online to when that player last plays the game online we then compute the weightedaverage number of days for all onlineenabled games by multiplying the weightedaverage number of days for each onlineenabled game by its relative percentage of total units sold from these onlineenabled games  ie  a game with more units sold will have a higher weighting to the overall computation than a game with fewer units sold under a similar computation we also consider the estimated period of time between the date a game unit is sold to a reseller and the date the reseller sells the game unit to an end consumer  ie  time in channel based on these two calculations we then consider the method of distribution for example   physical software games sold at retail would have a composite offering period equal to the online gameplay plus time in channel as opposed to digitally distributed software games which are delivered immediately via digital download and thus have no concept of channel additionally we consider results from prior analyses known and expected online gameplay trends as well as disclosed service periods for competitors’ games in determining the estimated offering period for future sales 

while we consistently apply this methodology inherent assumptions used in this methodology include which onlineenabled games to sample whether to use only units that have registered online whether to weight the number of days for each game whether to weight the days based on the units sold of each game determining the period of time between the date of sale to reseller and the date of sale to the consumer and assessing online gameplay trends 

we recognize revenue from the sale of onlineenabled games for which we do not have vsoe for the unspecified updates on a straightline basis generally over an estimated ninemonth period beginning in the month after shipment for physical games sold through retail and an estimated sixmonth period for digitallydistributed games 

deferred net revenue onlineenabled games 

because the majority of our sales are subject to a deferral period of generally six to nine months our deferred net revenue onlineenabled games balance is material this balance increases from period to period by the revenue being deferred for current sales and is reduced by the recognition of revenue from prior sales that were deferred ie the “net change” in the deferred balance however given the seasonal sales nature of our business the net change in the deferred balance may be material from period to period for example because our sales have historically been highest in the fiscal third quarter the deferred net revenue onlineenabled games balance generally increases significantly in the third fiscal quarter similarly because sales have historically been lowest in the first fiscal quarter the deferred net revenue onlineenabled games balance generally decreases significantly in the first fiscal quarter of a fiscal year 

other multipleelement arrangements 

in some of our multipleelement arrangements we sell nonsoftware products with software andor softwarerelated offerings these nonsoftware products are generally music soundtracks peripherals or ancillary collectors’ items such as figurines and comic books revenue for these arrangements is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each deliverable using the relative selling prices of each deliverable in the arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy described below if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable the arrangement consideration is allocated to the software deliverables as a group and then allocated to each software deliverable 

we determine the selling price for a nonsoftware product deliverable based on the following selling price hierarchy vsoe  ie  the price we charge when the nonsoftware product is sold separately if available thirdparty evidence “tpe” of fair value  ie  the price charged by others for similar nonsoftware products if vsoe is not available or our best estimate of selling price “besp” if neither vsoe nor tpe is available determining the besp is a subjective process that is based on multiple factors including but not limited to recent selling prices and related discounts market conditions customer classes 

sales channels and other factors provided the other three revenue recognition criteria other than delivery have been met we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer as we have no further obligations 

we must make assumptions and judgments in order to 1 determine whether and when each element is delivered 2 determine whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element and 3 allocate the total price among the various elements as applicable changes to any of these assumptions and judgments or changes to the elements in the arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

principal agent considerations 

we evaluate sales of our interactive software games extracontent and services from our subscription offerings via third party storefronts including digital channel storefronts from microsoft sony apple and google in order to determine whether or not we are acting as the primary obligor in the sale to the end consumer which we consider in determining if revenue should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the storefront key indicators that we evaluate in determining gross versus net treatment include but are not limited to the following 

 based on evaluation of the above indicators we have determined that generally the third party is considered the primary obligor to end consumers for the sale of our interactive software games we therefore report revenue related to these arrangements net of the fees retained by the storefront 

sales returns and allowances 

we reduce revenue for estimated future returns and price protection which may occur with our distributors and retailers “channel partners” price protection represents our practice to provide our channel partners with a credit allowance to lower their wholesale price on a particular product that they have not resold to end consumers the amount of the price protection is generally the difference between the old wholesale price and the new reduced wholesale price in certain countries for our pc and console packaged goods software products we also have a practice of allowing channel partners to return older software products in the channel in exchange for a credit allowance as a general practice we do not give cash refunds 

when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances we analyze the following historical credit allowances current sellthrough of our channel partners’ inventory of our software products current trends in retail and the video game industry changes in customer demand acceptance of our software products and other related factors in addition we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection in subsequent periods 

in the future actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold software products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms product updates or competing software products while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters these estimates are inherently subjective accordingly if our estimates change our returns and price protection allowances would change and would impact the total net revenue and related balance sheet accounts that we report 

fair value estimates 

business combinations    we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities and contingencies assumed acquired inprocess technology and contingent consideration issued in a business combination our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various estimated useful lives furthermore the estimated fair value assigned to an acquired asset or liability has a direct impact on the amount we recognize as goodwill which is an asset that is not amortized determining the fair value of assets acquired requires an assessment of the highest and best use or the expected price to sell the asset and the related expected future cash flows determining the fair value of acquired inprocess technology also requires an assessment of our expectations related to the use of that technology determining the fair value of an assumed liability requires an assessment of the expected cost to transfer the liability determining the fair value of contingent consideration requires an assessment of the probabilityweighted expected future cash flows over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled and applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration payable are forecasted earnings significant changes in forecasted earnings would 

result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurement this fair value assessment is also required in periods subsequent to a business combination such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

royalties and licenses 

our royalty expenses consist of payments to 1 content licensors 2 independent software developers and 3 copublishing and distribution affiliates license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities professional sports organizations movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks copyrights personal publicity rights content andor other intellectual property royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games copublishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of products 

royaltybased obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid these royaltybased obligations are generally expensed to cost of revenue generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on the total projected net revenue for contracts with guaranteed minimums significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors including 1 the total number of titles subject to the contract 2 the timing of the release of these titles 3 the number of software units and amount of extra content that we expect to sell which can be impacted by a number of variables including product quality number of platforms we release on the timing of the title’s release and competition and 4 future pricing determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products furthermore if we conclude that we are unable to make a reasonably reliable forecast of projected net revenue we recognize royalty expense at the greater of contract rate or on a straightline basis over the term of the contract accordingly if our future revenue projections change our effective royalty rates would change which could impact the amount and timing of royalty expense we recognize 

prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and copublishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product and therefore we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product accordingly payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred payments due after completion of the product primarily royaltybased in nature are generally expensed as cost of revenue 

our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor when performance remains with the licensor we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract 

each quarter we also evaluate the expected future realization of our royaltybased assets as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product and service sales any impairments or losses determined before the launch of a product are generally charged to research and development expense impairments or losses determined postlaunch are charged to cost of revenue we evaluate longlived royaltybased assets for impairment using undiscounted cash flows when impairment indicators exist if impairment exists then the assets are written down to fair value unrecognized minimum royaltybased commitments are accounted for as executory contracts and therefore any losses on these commitments are recognized when the underlying intellectual property is abandoned  ie  cease use or the contractual rights to use the intellectual property are terminated 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both 1 the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and 2 the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carryforwards we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified 

in addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities the carryback of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law and the implementation of tax planning 

strategies evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence this evaluation involves assumptions about future activity 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we realized significant us pretax income for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 as a result we released the valuation allowance against all of the us federal deferred tax assets and a portion of the us state deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we continue to maintain a valuation allowance related to specific us state deferred tax assets and foreign capital loss carryovers due to uncertainty about the future realization of these assets 

our effective tax rate and resulting provision for income taxes for the year ended march 31 2018 were significantly impacted by the us tax act enacted on december 22 2017 the us tax act significantly revised the us corporate income tax system by among other things lowering the us corporate income tax rate to 21 percent generally implementing a territorial tax system and imposing the transition tax 

reasonable estimates of the impacts of the us tax act are provided in accordance with sec guidance that allows for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the us tax act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts we expect to complete the accounting under the us tax act as soon as practicable but in no event later than one year from the enactment date of the us tax act 

the final calculations of tax expenses and tax benefits resulting from the us tax act may differ from our estimates potentially materially due to among other things changes in interpretations of the us tax act our further analysis of the us tax act or any updates or changes to estimates that we have utilized to calculate the transition impacts 

prior to the us tax act a substantial majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were considered to be indefinitely reinvested the us tax act included a mandatory onetime tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and as a result substantially all previously unremitted earnings for which no us deferred tax liability had been accrued have now been subject to us tax 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate these estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation as well as with respect to other matters such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities the ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations in addition changes in our business including acquisitions changes in our international corporate structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix and amount of income as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities valuation allowances applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective tax rate

our effective tax rates for fiscal year 2019 and future periods will continue to depend on a variety of factors including changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions changes in our international structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix of income changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in our annual pretax income or loss we anticipate that the impact of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies may result in significant fluctuations to our effective tax rate in the future

the us tax act creates new us taxes on foreign earnings our provision for income taxes for the year ended march 31 2018 provisionally does not reflect any deferred tax impacts of the us taxes on foreign earnings because of the complexity of the rules regarding the new tax on foreign earnings we are continuing to evaluate this accounting policy election

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market prices which have experienced significant volatility market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below while we do not hedge our shortterm investment portfolio we protect our shortterm investment portfolio against different market risks including interest rate risk as discussed below our cash and cash equivalents portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for speculative trading purposes and do not hedge our market price risk relating to marketable equity securities if any 

foreign currency exchange risk 

foreign currency exchange rates international sales are a fundamental part of our business and the strengthening of the us dollar particularly relative to the euro british pound sterling australian dollar chinese yuan and south korean won has a negative impact on our reported international net revenue but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses particularly the swedish krona and canadian dollar because these amounts are translated at lower rates as compared to periods in which the us dollar is weaker while we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risk these activities are limited in the protection that they provide us and can themselves result in losses 

cash flow hedging activities  we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreigncurrencydenominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing foreign currency forward contracts that generally have maturities of 18 months  or less these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements in net revenue and research and development expenses 

balance sheet hedging activities  we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk associated with foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily intercompany receivables and payables the foreign currency forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three months or less and are transacted near monthend 

we believe the counterparties to our foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations as of march 31 2018  a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent  or 20 percent  would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value on our foreign currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging of 193 million  or 386 million  respectively as of march 31 2018  a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent  or 20 percent  would have resulted in potential losses on our foreign currency forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of 47 million  or 93 million  respectively this sensitivity analysis assumes an adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates however all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and actual results may differ materially see note 4  derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as it relates to our derivative financial instruments which is incorporated by reference into this item 7a 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities however because shortterm investments mature relatively quickly and if reinvested are invested at the thencurrent market rates interest income on a portfolio consisting of shortterm investments is subject to market fluctuations to a greater extent than a portfolio of longer term investments additionally the contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to call prepay or otherwise settle the investments at prices less than the stated par value our investments are held for purposes other than trading we do not use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio 

as of march 31 2018  our shortterm investments were classified as availableforsale securities and consequently were recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax in stockholders’ equity 

notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations fluctuations in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio the following table presents the hypothetical changes in the fair value of our shortterm investment portfolio as of march 31 2018  arising from potential changes in interest rates the modeling technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps

 item 1 business 

overview 

we are a global leader in digital interactive entertainment we develop market publish and distribute games content and services that can be played by consumers on a variety of platforms which include game consoles pcs mobile phones and tablets 

our strategy 

we have three core pillars to our strategy 

• players first 

• commitment to digital 

• one ea 

players first 

players are the foundation of our success and we are committed to thinking about players first in everything we do our goal is to build deep ongoing and meaningful relationships with our players we aim to build these relationships by creating amazing games and services that deliver longlasting fun and enduring value by connecting with our players across platforms and by delivering flexibility and innovation in our business models 

our games and services are based on a portfolio of intellectual property that includes established brands such as fifa madden nfl star wars battlefield the sims and need for speed our goal is to develop and publish a broad and deep portfolio of games and services that engages players across geographies platforms and business models we were the number one publisher on playstation 4 and xbox one consoles in the western world for fiscal year 2017 based on available sources and ea estimates and in calendar year 2016 fifa 17  was the bestselling console title in the world 

commitment to digital 

players increasingly purchase our games digitally and engage with the live services associated with our portfolio of games our live services engagement model includes microtransactions downloadable content subscriptions esports among others for example features such as the ultimate team mode in our fifa madden nfl and nhl games and live services for our star wars battlefield and sims franchises have extended the life of those games by engaging players over longer periods of time this digital transformation also is creating opportunities in platforms content models and modalities of play for example we have leveraged franchises historically associated with consoles and traditional pc gaming such as fifa madden nfl the sims simcity and star wars to create mobile and pc freetodownload games that are monetized through a business model in which we sell incremental content andor features in discrete transactions 

  

we have significantly increased our digital net revenue from 2199 billion in fiscal year 2015 to 2409 billion in fiscal year 2016 and 2874 billion during fiscal year 2017 we believe that our digital revenue which generally has a higher gross margin relative to packaged goods revenue will continue to increase during fiscal year 2018 relative to packaged goods 

revenue and in absolute terms as we continue to focus on developing and monetizing products and services that can be delivered digitally 

one ea 

the pursuit of our goals requires that we operate as one team that is fast focused and constantly evolving and we have undertaken a cultural shift across our organization to become more flexible we are transitioning from developing our console and pc products and services on over twenty game engines to developing on a single game engine this transition has created operational flexibility as our development teams code in the same language increases the pace of our development as content can be leveraged across franchises and allows us to transition our products and services to new platforms quickly and costeffectively 

we are also working to strengthen our player network connecting our players to each other and to the games they love we are investing in a technology foundation to enable us to build personalized player relationships that can last for years instead of days or weeks by connecting our players to us and to each other this connection allows us to market and deliver content and services for popular franchises like fifa battlefield and star wars to our players more efficiently that same foundation also enables new playercentric ways to discover and try new experiences such as our subscriptionbased ea access and origin access services 

our games and services 

we develop games and services for a variety of platforms including consoles pcs mobile phones and tablets we market and sell our games and services through digital distribution channels and through retail channels we believe that flexibility across platforms distribution channels and business models is critical to maintaining and growing our player base as well as increasing engagement with our games and services new gaming platforms engagement models and business models are expected to continue to emerge in the future and we intend to evaluate these opportunities on a casebycase basis 

digitally our console games and services can be purchased through thirdparty storefronts such as sony’s playstation store and microsoft’s xbox store our direct sales to sony and microsoft represented approximately 19 percent  and 17 percent  of total net revenue respectively in fiscal 2017 our direct sales to sony and microsoft represented approximately 16 percent and 14 percent of total net revenue respectively in fiscal 2016 our direct sales to microsoft represented approximately 10 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2015   our mobile and tablet games and services are available through thirdparty application storefronts such as the apple app store and google play our pc games and services can be downloaded directly through our origin platform as well as through thirdparty online download stores we also partner with third parties to publish our mobile and pc games on their platforms in certain asian territories such as our partnerships with tencent holdings limited and nexon co ltd for fifa online 3  in china and korea respectively players can also access a catalog of our console and pc games through our subscriptionbased ea access and origin access services respectively 

our packaged goods games are sold directly to mass market retailers electronics specialty stores and game software specialty stores or through distribution arrangements our direct sales to gamestop represented approximately 11 percent of total net revenue in fiscal year 2015 and were not greater than ten percent of total net revenue in either fiscal year 2016 or fiscal year 2017 we sell our games to gamestop pursuant to numerous and frequent individual purchase orders which contain delivery and pricing terms there are no minimum sales or purchase commitments between us and gamestop 

in our games we use established brands that we either wholly own such as battlefield mass effect need for speed the sims and plants v zombies or license from others such as fifa madden nfl and star wars from time to time we contract with external game developers such as respawn entertainment to develop our games or to publish and distribute their games we believe our established brands give us the opportunity to engage an increasing number of players across more platforms more geographies and through more business models 

in fiscal year 2017 net revenue from our ultimate team  services and fifa 17  represented approximately 16 percent and 11 percent respectively of our total net revenue in fiscal year 2016 net revenue from our ultimate team  services and fifa 16  represented approximately 15 percent and 11 percent respectively of our total net revenue in fiscal year 2015 net revenue from our ultimate team  services battlefield 4 and fifa 15  represented approximately 13 percent 11 percent and 11 percent respectively of our total net revenue 

we also are investing in a number of longterm initiatives that we believe will allow us to better serve and deepen our engagement with our players such as our ea competitive gaming division through which we will focus our efforts in competitive gaming and esports 

significant relationships 

sony  microsoft  under the terms of agreements we have entered into with sony computer entertainment inc and its affiliates and with microsoft corporation and its affiliates we are authorized to develop and distribute discbased and digitallydelivered software products and services compatible with playstation and xbox consoles respectively as of the date of this filing we have not entered into a licensed publisher agreement with sony for playstation 4 and the parties currently operate under the terms of existing agreements   subject to a new pricing structure with respect to playstation 4 

under the agreements with sony and microsoft we are provided with the nonexclusive right to use for a fixed term and in a designated territory technology that is owned or licensed by them to publish our games on their respective platform our transactions for discbased products are made pursuant to individual purchase orders which are accepted on a caseby case basis by sony or microsoft or their designated replicators as the case may be for packaged goods products we pay the console manufacturers a perunit royalty for each unit manufactured with respect to digitallydelivered products and services the console manufacturers pay us either a wholesale price or a percentage royalty on the revenue they derive from their sales of our products and services many key commercial terms of our relationships with sony and microsoft  such as manufacturing terms delivery times platform policies and approval conditions  are determined unilaterally and are subject to change by the console manufacturers 

the platform license agreements also require us to indemnify the console manufacturers for any loss liability and expense resulting from any claim against the console manufacturer regarding our games and services including any claims for patent copyright or trademark infringement brought against the console manufacturer each platform license may be terminated by the console manufacturer if a breach or default by us is not cured after we receive written notice from the console manufacturer or if we become insolvent the console manufacturers are not obligated to enter into platform license agreements with us for any future consoles products or services 

apple google and other app stores  we have agreements to distribute our mobile applications and additional content through distributors such as apple and google our applications are downloaded for mobile devices from third party application storefronts the distributor either charges consumers a onetime fee to download the application or charges consumers for content purchased within the application after it is downloaded for free our distribution agreements establish the amounts that are retained by the distributor and the amounts passed through to us these arrangements are typically terminable on short notice the agreements generally do not obligate the distributors to market or distribute any of our applications 

publishing partners in asia  we have entered into agreements whereby we partner with certain companies including tencent holdings limited and nexon co ltd or their respective affiliates pursuant to which these companies publish our mobile and pc freetodownload games in certain asian territories including china and korea our players access games from the publishers’ platforms and are charged for additional content purchased within our game environment the agreements generally establish the amounts that are retained by the publisher and the amounts passed through to us 

competition 

the market for interactive entertainment is intensely competitive and changes rapidly as new products and platforms are introduced we also face competition for the right to use certain intellectual property included in our products we face significant competition from companies such as activision blizzard taketwo interactive ubisoft bethesda tencent sony and microsoft primarily with respect to developing games and services that operate on consoles pcs andor mobile devices 

more broadly we compete against providers of different sources of entertainment such as motion pictures television social networking online casual entertainment and music that our players could enjoy in their free time important competitive factors in our industry include game quality and ease of use compatibility of products with certain platforms brand recognition price marketing and quality of customer service 

intellectual property 

to establish and protect our intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyrights trademarks patents patent applications trade secrets knowhow license agreements confidentiality provisions and procedures and other contractual provisions we actively engage in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property in addition we engage in activities designed to limit the impact of abuse of our digital products and services including monitoring our games for evidence of exploitation and rebalancing our game environments in the event that such abuse is discovered 

governmental regulation 

we are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet in addition laws and regulations that may have an impact on our business relating to user privacy data collection retention electronic commerce virtual items and currency consumer protection content advertising localization and information security have been adopted or are being considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world 

seasonality 

we have historically experienced the highest percentage of our sales in our third fiscal quarter due to seasonal holiday demand and the launch timing of our games however there can be no assurance that this will continue in addition we defer the recognition of a significant amount of net revenue over an extended period of time as a result the quarter in which we generate the highest net sales may be different from the quarter in which we recognize the highest amount of net revenue 

employees 

as of march 31 2017 we had approximately 8800 regular fulltime employees over 5500 of whom were outside the united states we believe that our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is a critical factor in the successful development of our products and services and that our future success will depend in large measure on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees approximately 7 percent of our employees all of whom work for our dice development studio in sweden are represented by a union

risk factors 

tableend 

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs our business or financial performance could be harmed our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe could be material that may harm our business or financial performance 

our business is intensely competitive and “hit” driven we may not deliver “hit” products and services or consumers may prefer our competitors’ products or services over our own 

competition in our industry is intense many new products and services are regularly introduced in each major industry segment console mobile and pc freetodownload but only a relatively small number of “hit” titles account for a significant portion of total revenue in each segment our competitors range from established interactive entertainment companies and diversified media companies to emerging startups and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge throughout the world if our competitors develop and market more successful and engaging products or services offer competitive products or services at lower price points or if we do not continue to develop consistently highquality wellreceived and engaging products and services our revenue margins and profitability will decline 

we maintain a relatively limited product portfolio in an effort to focus on developing highquality and engaging products with the potential to become hits highquality titles even if highlyreviewed may not turn into hit products many hit products within our industry are iterations of prior hit products with large established consumer bases and significant brand recognition which makes competing in certain product categories challenging in addition hit products or services of our competitors may take a larger portion of consumer spending or time than we anticipate which could cause our products and services to underperform relative to our expectations publishing a relatively small number of major titles each year also concentrates risk in those titles and means each major title has greater associated risk a significant portion of our revenue historically has been derived from games and services based on a few popular franchises and the underperformance of a single major title could have a material adverse impact on our financial results the increased importance of live services revenue to our business heightens the risks associated with our limited product portfolio as live services that are either poorlyreceived or provided in connection with underperforming games may generate lower than expected sales 

our business is dependent on the success and availability of platforms developed by third parties as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for these platforms 

the success of our business is driven in part by the commercial success and adequate supply of third party platforms for which we develop our products and services or through which our products and services are distributed our success also depends on our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be successful in the marketplace our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for these platforms and our ability to effectively manage the transition from one generation of platforms to the next we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of anticipated platform release dates and may incur significant expense to adjust our product portfolio and development efforts in response to changing consumer platform preferences additionally we may enter into certain exclusive licensing arrangements that affect our ability to deliver or market products or services on certain platforms a platform for which we are developing products and services may not succeed as expected or new platforms may take market share and interactive entertainment consumers away from platforms for which we have devoted significant resources if consumer demand for the platforms for which we are developing products and services is lower than our expectations we may be unable to fully recover the investments we have made in developing our products and services and our financial performance will be harmed alternatively a platform for which we have not devoted significant resources could be more successful than we initially anticipated causing us to not be able to take advantage of meaningful revenue opportunities 

technology changes rapidly in our business and if we fail to anticipate or   successfully implement new technologies or adopt new business strategies technologies or methods the quality timeliness and competitiveness of our products and services may suffer 

rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate sometimes years in advance which technologies we must develop implement and take advantage of in order to make our products and services competitive in the market we have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies technologies products and services for example we are investing in the infrastructure for our ea player network which we expect will allow us to market and deliver content and services for our franchises more efficiently as well as enable new playercentric ways to discover and try new experiences such endeavors may 

involve significant risks and uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the technology we choose to adopt and the products and services that we pursue will be successful if we do not successfully implement these new technologies our reputation may be materially adversely affected and our financial condition and operating results may be impacted we also may miss opportunities to adopt technology or develop products and services that become popular with consumers which could adversely affect our financial results it may take significant time and resources to shift our focus to such technologies putting us at a competitive disadvantage 

our development process usually starts with particular platforms and distribution methods in mind and a range of technical development and feature goals that we hope to be able to achieve we may not be able to achieve these goals or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly and effectively than we can in either case our products and services may be technologically inferior to those of our competitors less appealing to consumers or both if we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule for our products and services then we may delay their release until these goals can be achieved which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses alternatively we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies either to preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up with our competition which would increase our development expenses 

we may experience security breaches and cyber threats 

we continually face cyber risks and threats that seek to damage disrupt or gain access to our networks our products and services supporting infrastructure intellectual property and other assets in addition we rely on technological infrastructure provided by third party business partners to support the online functionality of our products and services these business partners as well as our channel partners also are subject to cyber risks and threats such cyber risks and threats may be difficult to detect both our partners and we have implemented certain systems and processes to guard against cyber risks and to help protect our data and systems however the techniques that may be used to obtain unauthorized access or disable degrade exploit or sabotage our products services and systems change frequently and often are not detected our systems and processes and the systems and processes of our business partners may not be adequate any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or cyber risks or respond adequately to a security breach or cyber risk could result in interruptions to our products and services degrade the user experience cause consumers to lose confidence in our products as well as significant legal and financial exposure this could harm our business and reputation disrupt our relationships with partners and diminish our competitive position 

successful exploitation of our systems can have other negative effects upon the products services and user experience we offer in particular the virtual economies that we have established in many of our games are subject to abuse exploitation and other forms of fraudulent activity that can negatively impact our business virtual economies involve the use of virtual currency andor virtual assets that can be used or redeemed by a player within a particular game or service the abuse or exploitation of our virtual economies include the illegitimate generation and sale of virtual items in black markets our online services have been impacted by ingame exploits and the use of automated processes to generate virtual currency illegitimately and such activity may continue these kinds of activities and the steps that we take to address these issues may result in a loss of anticipated revenue interfere with players’ enjoyment of a balanced game environment and cause reputational harm 

our business could be adversely affected if our consumer protection data privacy and security practices are not adequate or perceived as being inadequate to prevent data breaches or by the application of consumer protection and data privacy and security laws generally 

in the course of our business we collect process store and use consumer and other information including personal information passwords and credit card information although we take measures to protect this information from unauthorized access acquisition disclosure and misuse our security controls policies and practices may not be able to prevent the improper or unauthorized access acquisition or disclosure of such information for example third parties may fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing identification or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems the unauthorized access acquisition or disclosure of this information or a perception that we do not adequately secure consumer and other information could result in legal liability costly remedial measures governmental and regulatory investigations harm our profitability and reputation and cause our financial results to be materially affected in addition third party vendors and business partners receive access to information that we collect these vendors and business partners may not prevent data security breaches with respect to the information we provide them or fully enforce our policies contractual obligations and disclosures regarding the collection use storage transfer and retention of personal data a data security breach of one of our vendors or business partners could cause reputational harm to them andor negatively impact our ability to offer our products and services 

we are subject to payment card association rules and obligations pursuant to contracts with payment card processors under these rules and obligations if information is compromised we could be liable to payment card issuers for the cost of associated expenses and penalties in addition if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards even if no consumer information is compromised we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs 

data privacy data protection localization security and consumerprotection laws are evolving and the interpretation and application of these laws in the united states europe and elsewhere often are uncertain contradictory and changing it is possible that these laws may be interpreted or applied in a manner that is adverse to us or otherwise inconsistent with our practices which could result in litigation regulatory investigations and potential legal liability or require us to change our practices in a manner adverse to our business as a result our reputation and brand may be harmed we could incur substantial costs and we could lose both consumers and revenue 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services 

we are investing and expect to continue to invest in technology hardware and software to support the online functionality of our portfolio of products and services in addition we rely on technological infrastructure provided by third party business partners launching and operating games and services with online features developing related technologies and implementing online business initiatives is expensive and complex implementation of these technologies and execution of these initiatives could result in operational failures and other issues impacting the technical stability of our products and services in addition having access to the necessary infrastructure to support the online functionality of our products and services is vital to our growth and success our products and services could be adversely impacted by outages disruptions and failures in our network and related infrastructure as well as in the online platforms or services of key business partners who offer or support our products and services 

we may not consistently meet our product development schedules or key events sports seasons or movies that we tie our product release schedules to may be delayed cancelled or poorly received 

our ability to meet product development schedules is affected by a number of factors both within and outside our control including feedback from our players the creative processes involved the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams the complexity of our products and the platforms for which they are developed the need to finetune our products prior to their release and in certain cases approvals from third parties we have experienced development delays for our products in the past which caused us to delay or cancel release dates we also seek to release certain products in conjunction with key events such as the beginning of a sports season major sporting event or the release of a related movie if such a key event were delayed cancelled or poorly received our sales likely would suffer materially any failure to meet anticipated production or release schedules likely would result in a delay of revenue andor possibly a significant shortfall in our revenue increase our development andor marketing expenses harm our profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different than anticipated 

our business is highly seasonal with the highest percentage of our sales occurring in the quarter ending in december while our sales generally follow this seasonal trend there can be no assurance that this trend will continue if we miss key selling periods for products for any reason including product delays product cancellations or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have developed products and services or through which we distribute our products and services our sales likely will suffer significantly additionally macroeconomic conditions or the occurrence of unforeseen events that negatively impact retailer or consumer buying patterns particularly during the quarter ending in december likely will harm our financial performance disproportionately 

our financial results are subject to currency fluctuations 

international sales are a fundamental part of our business for our fiscal year ended march 31 2017 international net revenue comprised 56 percent of our total net revenue and we expect our international business to continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue as a result of our international sales and also the denomination of our foreign investments and our cash and cash equivalents in foreign currencies we are exposed to the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates strengthening of the us dollar particularly relative to the euro british pound sterling australian dollar chinese yuan and south korean won has a negative impact on our reported international net revenue but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses particularly when the us dollar strengthens against the swedish krona and the canadian dollar because these amounts are translated at lower rates we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency risk however these activities are limited in the protection they provide us from foreign currency fluctuations and can themselves result in losses 

we may not attract and retain key personnel 

the market for technical creative marketing and other personnel essential to the development marketing and support of our products and services and management of our businesses is extremely competitive our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting our executives as well as key creative and technical talent if we cannot successfully recruit and retain qualified employees or replace key employees following their departure our ability to develop and manage our business will be impaired 

we may experience declines or fluctuations in the recurring portion of our business 

our business model includes revenue that we deem recurring in nature such as revenue from our annualized titles eg fifa and madden nfl and associated services and ongoing mobile businesses while we have been able to forecast the revenue from these areas of our business with greater certainty than for new offerings we cannot provide assurances that consumers will purchase these games and services on a consistent basis furthermore we may cease to offer games and services that we previously had deemed to be recurring in nature consumer purchases of our games and services may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their level of satisfaction with our games and services our ability to improve and innovate our annualized titles our ability to adapt our games and services to new platforms outages and disruptions of online services the games and services offered by our competitors our marketing and advertising efforts or declines in consumer activity generally as a result of economic downturns among others the reception to our licensed sports games may be adversely impacted by circumstances outside our control impacting the sports leagues and organizations any decline or fluctuation in the recurring portion of our business may have a negative impact on our financial and operating results 

we could fail to successfully adopt new business models 

from time to time we seek to establish and implement new business models forecasting the success of any new business model is inherently uncertain and depends on a number of factors both within and outside of our control our actual revenue and profit for these businesses may be significantly greater or less than our forecasts additionally these new business models could fail resulting in the loss of our investment in the development and infrastructure needed to support these new business models as well as the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from more successful and established businesses 

we may be unable to maintain or acquire licenses to include intellectual property owned by others in our games or to maintain or acquire the rights to publish or distribute games developed by others 

many of our products and services are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our ea sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players’ associations and our star wars products include rights licensed from disney competition for these licenses and rights is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses and rights or obtain additional licenses or rights with significant commercial value our ability to develop and successful and engaging games and services may be adversely affected and our revenue profitability and cash flows may decline significantly competition for these licenses also may increase the amounts that we must pay to licensors and developers through higher minimum guarantees or royalty rates which could significantly increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

external game developers may not meet product development schedules or otherwise honor their obligations 

we may contract with external game developers to develop our games or to publish or distribute their games while we maintain contractual protections we have less control over the product development schedules of games developed by external developers and we depend on their ability to meet product development schedules in addition we may have disputes with external developers over game content launch timing achievement of certain milestones the game development timeline marketing campaigns or other matters if we have disputes with external developers or they cannot meet product development schedules acquire certain approvals or are otherwise unable or unwilling to honor their obligations to us we may delay or cancel previously announced games alter our launch schedule or experience increased costs and expenses which could result in a delay or significant shortfall in anticipated revenue harm our profitability and reputation and cause our financial results to be materially affected 

negative player perceptions about our brands products services andor business practices may damage our business and the costs incurred in addressing player concerns may increase our operating expenses 

player expectations regarding the quality performance and integrity of our products and services are high players may be critical of our brands products services andor business practices for a wide variety of reasons these negative player reactions may not be foreseeable or within our control to manage effectively including perceptions about gameplay fairness negative player reactions to game content components and services or objections to certain of our business practices in the past we have taken actions 

including delaying the release of our games and discontinuing services for our games after taking into consideration among other things feedback from the player community even if those decisions negatively impacted our operating results in the short term we expect to continue to take actions to address concerns as appropriate including actions that may result in additional expenditures and the loss of revenue negative player sentiment about our business practices also can lead to investigations from regulatory agencies and consumer groups as well as litigation which regardless of their outcome may be costly damaging to our reputation and harm our business 

the products or services we release may contain defects 

our products and services are extremely complex software programs and are difficult to develop and distribute we have quality controls in place to detect defects in our products and services before they are released nonetheless these quality controls are subject to human error overriding and reasonable resource or technical constraints therefore these quality controls and preventative measures may not be effective in detecting all defects in our products and services before they have been released into the marketplace in such an event we could be required to or may find it necessary to offer a refund for the product or service suspend the availability or sale of the product or service or expend significant resources to cure the defect each of which could significantly harm our business and operating results 

our business is subject to regulation and changes in applicable regulations may negatively impact our business 

we are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet in addition laws and regulations relating to user privacy data collection retention electronic commerce virtual items and currency consumer protection content advertising localization and information security have been adopted or are being considered for adoption by many jurisdictions and countries throughout the world these laws could harm our business by limiting the products and services we can offer consumers or the manner in which we offer them the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation furthermore any failure on our part to comply with these laws or the application of these laws in an unanticipated manner may harm our business and result in penalties or significant legal liability 

we are subject to laws in certain foreign countries and adhere to industry standards in the united states that mandate rating requirements or set other restrictions on the advertisement or distribution of interactive entertainment software based on content in addition certain foreign countries allow government censorship of interactive entertainment software products adoption of ratings systems censorship or restrictions on distribution of interactive entertainment software based on content could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers in addition compliance with new and possibly inconsistent regulations for different territories could be costly delay or prevent the release of our products in those territories 

in addition we may include modes in our games that allow players to compete against each other and we may manage player competitions based on our products and services although we structure and operate these skillbased competitions with applicable laws in mind our skill based competitions in the future could become subject to evolving rules and regulations and expose us to significant liability penalties and reputational harm 

our marketing and advertising efforts may fail to resonate with our customers 

our products and services are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs such as online and mobile advertising television advertising retail merchandising marketing through websites event sponsorship and direct communications with our consumers including via email an increasing portion of our marketing activity is taking place on social media platforms that are outside of our direct control changes to consumer preferences marketing regulations technology changes or service disruptions may negatively impact our ability to reach our customers our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part upon the success of these programs if the marketing for our products and services fails to resonate with our customers particularly during the critical holiday season or during other key selling periods or if advertising rates or other media placement costs increase our business and operating results could be harmed 

a significant portion of our sales are made to a relatively small number of   customers and these sales may be disrupted 

we derive a significant percentage of our net revenue through sales to our top customers the concentration of a significant percentage of our sales through a few large customers could lead to a shortterm disruption to our business if certain of these customers significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to offer our products and services we also could be more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers experienced a deterioration of their business or declared bankruptcy additionally receivables from our customers generally increase in our december fiscal quarter as sales of our products and services generally increase in anticipation of the holiday season having a significant portion of our net revenue concentrated in sales through a few customers could reduce our negotiating leverage with them if one or more of our key customers experience deterioration in their business or become unable to obtain sufficient financing to maintain their operations our business could be harmed 

our channel partners have significant influence over the products and services that we offer on their platforms 

our agreements with our channel partners typically give them significant control over the approval manufacturing and distribution of the products and services that we develop for their platform in particular our arrangements with sony and microsoft could in certain circumstances leave us unable to get our products and services approved manufactured and distributed to customers for our digital products and services delivered via digital channels such as sony’s playstation store microsoft’s xbox store apple’s app store and google play each respective channel partner has policies and guidelines that control the promotion and distribution of these titles and the features and functionalities that we are permitted to offer through the channel in addition we are dependent on our channel partners to invest in and upgrade digital commerce capabilities in a manner than corresponds to the way in which consumers purchase our products and services failure by our channels partners to keep pace with consumer preferences could have an adverse impact on our ability to merchandise and commercialize our products and services which could harm our business andor financial results 

moreover certain of our channel partners can determine and change unilaterally certain key terms and conditions including the ability to change their user and developer policies and guidelines in many cases our channel partners also set the rates that we must pay to provide our games and services through their online channels and retain flexibility to change their fee structures or adopt different fee structures for their online channels which could adversely impact our costs profitability and margins in addition our channel partners control the information technology systems through which online sales of our products and service channels are captured if our channel partners establish terms that restrict our offerings through their channels significantly impact the financial terms on which these products or services are offered to our customers or their information technology systems fail or cause an unanticipated delay in reporting our business andor financial results could be materially affected 

our business is subject to risks generally associated with the entertainment industry 

our business is subject to risks that are generally associated with the entertainment industry many of which are beyond our control these risks could negatively impact our operating results and include the popularity price and timing of our games economic conditions that adversely affect discretionary consumer spending changes in consumer demographics the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted 

our business partners may be unable to honor their obligations to us or their actions may put us at risk 

we rely on various business partners including thirdparty service providers vendors licensing partners development partners and licensees in many areas of our business their actions may put our business and our reputation at risk for example we may have disputes with our business partners that may impact our business andor financial results in many cases our business partners may be given access to sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support to our teams and they may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it in addition the failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies or the failure of the third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies could result in a disruption to our business operations further disruptions in the financial markets economic downturns poor business decisions or reputational harm may adversely affect our business partners and they may not be able to continue honoring their obligations to us or we may cease our arrangements with them alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner or vendor if we lose one or more significant business partners our business could be harmed and our financial results could be materially affected 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights 

from time to time third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights for example patent holding companies may assert patent claims against us in which they seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained although we take steps to avoid knowingly violating the intellectual property rights of others it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement 

existing or future infringement claims against us whether valid or not may be expensive to defend and divert the attention of our employees from business operations such claims or litigation could require us to pay damages and other costs we also could be required to stop selling distributing or supporting products features or services which incorporate the affected intellectual property rights redesign products features or services to avoid infringement or obtain a license all of which could be costly and harm our business 

in addition many patents have been issued that may apply to potential new modes of delivering playing or monetizing interactive entertainment software products and services such as those that we produce or would like to offer in the future we may discover that future opportunities to provide new and innovative modes of game play and game delivery to consumers may be precluded by existing patents that we are unable to license on reasonable terms 

from time to time we may become involved in other legal proceedings 

we are currently and from time to time in the future may become subject to legal proceedings claims litigation and government investigations or inquiries which could be expensive lengthy disruptive to normal business operations and occupy a significant amount of our employees’ time and attention in addition the outcome of any legal proceedings claims litigation investigations or inquiries may be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

acquisitions investments divestitures and other strategic transactions could result in   operating difficulties and other negative   consequences 

we may make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions including 1 acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets 2 minority investments in strategic partners and 3 investments in new interactive entertainment businesses as part of our longterm business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment that we acquire unknown liabilities diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses in addition we may not integrate these businesses successfully including experiencing difficulty in the integration of business systems and technologies the integration and retention of new employees or in the maintenance of key business and customer relationships these events could harm our operating results or financial condition we also may divest or sell assets or a business and we may have difficulty selling such assets or business on acceptable terms in a timely manner this could result in a delay in the achievement of our strategic objectives cause us to incur additional expense or the sale of such assets or business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we anticipated 

our products and brands are subject to the threat of piracy unauthorized copying and other forms of intellectual property infringement 

we regard our products and brands as proprietary and take measures to protect our products brands and other confidential information from infringement we are aware that some unauthorized copying of our products and brands occurs and if a significantly greater amount were to occur it could negatively impact our business 

piracy and other forms of unauthorized copying and use of our content and brands are persistent problems for us and policing is difficult further the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be distributed either do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states or are poorly enforced legal protection of our rights may be ineffective in such countries in addition although we take steps to enforce and police our rights factors such as   the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures used by our business partners or by us the availability of broadband access to the internet the refusal of internet service providers or platform holders to remove infringing content in certain instances and the proliferation of online channels through which infringing product is distributed all have contributed to an expansion in unauthorized copying of our products and brands 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our infrastructure 

we may experience outrages or disruptions of our infrastructure including information technology system failures and network disruptions these may be caused by natural disasters cyberincidents weather events power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or other events system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could prevent access to our products services or online stores selling our products and services our corporate headquarters in redwood city ca and our studio in burnaby british columbia are located in seismically active regions and certain of our game development activities and other essential business operations are conducted at these locations an event that results in the disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations 

we utilize debt financing and such indebtedness could adversely impact our business and financial condition 

we have 1 billion in senior unsecured notes outstanding as well as an unsecured committed 500 million revolving credit facility while the facility is currently undrawn we may use the proceeds of any future borrowings for general corporate purposes we may also enter into other financial instruments in the future 

our indebtedness could affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

 

 

 

the agreements governing our indebtedness impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants in particular the revolving credit facility includes a maximum capitalization ratio and minimum liquidity requirements our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of these covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities as well as the potential costs associated with any potential refinancing our indebtedness downgrades in our credit rating could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision tax assets and accruals for other taxes and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by our profit levels changes in our business reorganization of our business and operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the elections we make changes in applicable tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws or changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as well as other factors we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions furthermore we are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities with respect to both income and such other nonincome taxes adverse changes in our effective income tax rate unfavorable audit results or tax rulings or other changes resulting in significant additional tax liabilities could have material adverse effects upon our earnings cash flows and financial condition in addition the united states and other countries in which we do business are considering changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals which could adversely affect our effective tax rates cause us to change the way in which we structure our business or result in other costs to us 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in   financial accounting standards 

our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting standards promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies these methods estimates and judgments are subject to risks uncertainties assumptions and changes that could adversely affect our reported financial position 

and financial results in addition changes to applicable financial accounting standards could adversely affect our reported financial position and financial results for example recently issued accounting standards are expected to materially change the way in which we recognize revenue and account for leases upon adoption for more information see part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 1  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements under the subheading “impact of recently issued accounting standards” 

as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue costs and taxes could have an adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors above as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts’ earnings estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts’ and investors’ expectations to factors affecting the entertainment computer software internet media or electronics industries to our ability to successfully integrate any acquisitions we may make or to national or international economic conditions in particular economic downturns may contribute to the public stock markets experiencing extreme price and trading volume volatility these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings 

on july 29 2010 michael davis a former nfl running back filed a putative class action in the united states district court for the northern district of california against the company alleging that certain past versions of madden nfl  included the images of certain retired nfl players without their permission in march 2012 the trial court denied the company’s request to dismiss the complaint on first amendment grounds in january 2015 that trial court decision was affirmed by the ninth circuit court of appeals and the case was remanded back to the united states district court for the northern district of california on february 2 2017 the united states district court for the northern district of california denied the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification 

we are also subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we do not believe that any liability from any reasonably foreseeable disposition of such claims and litigation individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following overview is a highlevel discussion of our operating results as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers provides important context for our results for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form 10k including in the “business” section and the “risk factors” above the remainder of this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda”” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

about electronic arts 

we are a global leader in digital interactive entertainment we develop market publish and distribute games content and services that can be played by consumers on a variety of platforms which include game consoles pcs mobile phones and tablets in our games we use established brands that we either wholly own such as battlefield mass effect need for speed the sims and plants v zombies or license from others such as fifa madden nfl and star wars we also publish and distribute games developed by third parties eg  titanfall 

financial results 

our key financial results for our fiscal year ended march 31 2017  were as follows 

 total operating expenses would have been 2349 million up 10 percent year over year 

 

from time to time we make comparisons of current periods to prior periods with reference to constant currency constant currency comparisons are based on translating local currency amounts in the current period at actual foreign exchange rates from the prior comparable period we evaluate our financial performance on a constant currency basis in order to facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons without regard to the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates 

trends in our business 

digital business  players increasingly purchase our games digitally and engage with the live services associated with our portfolio of games for example the ultimate team mode incorporated into iterations of our fifa madden nfl and nhl franchises and live services available digitally for our star wars battlefield and sims franchises have extended the life of those games by engaging players for longer periods of time our digital transformation is also creating opportunities in platforms content models and modalities of play for example we have leveraged franchises typically associated with consoles and traditional pc gaming such as fifa madden nfl the sims simcity and star wars to create mobile and pc freetodownload games that are monetized through a business model in which we sell incremental content andor features in discrete transactions we also provide our ea access service on xbox one and origin access service on pc which offer players access to a selection of ea games and other benefits for a monthly or annual fee 

our digital transformation also gives us the opportunity to strengthen our player network we are investing in a technology foundation to enable us to build personalized player relationships that can last for years instead of days or weeks by connecting our players to us and to each other this connection allows us to market and deliver content and services for popular franchises like fifa battlefield and star wars to our players more efficiently that same foundation also enables new playercentric ways to discover and try new experiences such as our subscriptionbased ea access and origin access services 

we significantly increased our digital net revenue from 2199 million in fiscal year 2015 to 2409 million in fiscal year 2016 and 2874 million  during fiscal year 2017 we expect this portion of our business to continue to grow through fiscal year 2018 and beyond as we continue to focus on developing and monetizing products and services that can be delivered digitally 

foreign currency exchange rates international sales are a fundamental part of our business and the strengthening of the us dollar particularly relative to the euro british pound sterling australian dollar chinese yuan and south korean won has a negative impact on our reported international net revenue but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses particularly the swedish krona and canadian dollar because these amounts are translated at lower rates as compared to periods in which the us dollar is weaker volatility in exchange rates remains elevated as compared to historical standards and macroeconomic factors such as events related to the united kingdom’s vote to leave the european union inject uncertainty while we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risk these activities are limited in the protection that they provide us and can themselves result in losses 

mobile and pc freetodownload games  the global adoption of mobile devices and a business model for those devices that allows consumers to try new games with no upfront cost and pay for additional content or ingame items has led to significant growth in the mobile gaming industry we expect this growth to continue during our 2018 fiscal year likewise the wide consumer acceptance of freetodownload microtransactionbased pc games played over the internet has broadened our consumer base we expect revenue generated from mobile and pc freetodownload games to remain an important part of our business 

concentration of sales among the most popular games  in all major segments of our industry we see a large portion of games sales concentrated on the most popular titles similarly a significant portion of our revenue historically has been derived from games based on a few popular franchises several of which we have released on an annual or biannual basis the increased importance of live services revenue to our business has accelerated this trend live services revenue includes digital extra content subscriptions advertising and other digital revenues for example we derive a material portion of our revenue from the ultimate team game mode included in our annualized fifa madden nfl and nhl games 

recurring revenue sources our business model includes revenue that we deem recurring in nature such as revenue from our annualized titles such as fifa and madden nfl and associated services our ongoing mobile business and subscription programs we have been able to forecast revenue from these areas of our business with greater confidence than for new offerings as we continue to leverage the digital transformation in our industry and incorporate new content models and modalities of play into our games our goal is to continue to look for opportunities to expand the recurring portion of our business 

net sales  in order to improve transparency into our business we disclose an operating performance metric net sales net sales is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or soldin physically in the period 

net sales were 49 billion for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017 driven by sales of fifa 17  and battlefield 1  during the fiscal year net sales increased 376 million or 8 as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 due primarily to stronger sales associated with our fifa franchise and firstperson shooter titles on a yearoveryear basis digital net sales were 30 billion for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017 an increase of 503 million or 20 as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 the increase in digital net sales was driven by the ongoing digital transformation as players increasingly purchase our games digitally and engage with our live services specifically full game downloads net sales grew 222 million or 44 yearoveryear primarily from a higher percentage of full game downloads of battlefield 1  in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016’s firstperson shooter title star wars battlefront  in addition extra content grew 177 million or 16 yearoveryear driven by increased net sales associated with ultimate team services 

recent developments 

stock repurchase program in may 2017 a special committee of our board of directors on behalf of the full board of directors authorized a new program to repurchase up to 12 billion of our common stock this stock repurchase program expires on may 31 2019 under this program we may purchase stock in the open market or through privatelynegotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws including pursuant to prearranged stock trading plans the timing 

and actual amount of the stock repurchases will depend on several factors including price capital availability regulatory requirements alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions we are not obligated to repurchase a specific number of shares under this program and it may be modified suspended or discontinued at any time we are actively repurchasing shares under this program 

in april 2017 we completed the stock repurchase authorization approved by our board of directors in may 2015 during fiscal year 2017 we repurchased approximately 65 million  shares for approximately 508 million  pursuant to the may 2015 repurchase program 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities contingent assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown as a result actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

revenue recognition sales returns and allowances and bad debt reserves 

we derive revenue principally from sales of interactive software games and related content and services on game consoles pcs mobile phones and tablets we evaluate revenue recognition based on the criteria set forth in fasb accounting standards codification “asc” 605 revenue recognition and asc 985605 software revenue recognition  we classify our revenue as either product revenue or service and other revenue 

product revenue  our product revenue includes revenue associated with the sale of software games or related product content or updates whether delivered digitally  eg  fullgame downloads extracontent or via a physical disc  e  g  packaged goods and licensing of game software to thirdparties product revenue also includes revenue from mobile full game downloads that do not require our hosting support  eg  premium mobile games in order to utilize the game or related content  ie  can be played with or without an internet connection and sales of tangible products such as hardware peripherals or collectors’ items 

service and other revenue  our service revenue includes revenue recognized from timebased subscriptions games content or updates that requires our hosting support in order to utilize the game or related content  ie  can only be played with an internet connection this includes 1 entitlements to content that are accessed through hosting services  eg  microtransactions for internetbased social network and freetodownload mobile games 2 massively multiplayer online “mmo” games both software game and subscription sales 3 subscriptions for our battlefield premium ea and origin access and pogobranded online game services and 4 allocated service revenue from sales of software games with a service of online activities  eg  online playability our other revenue includes advertising and nonsoftware licensing revenue 

with respect to the allocated service revenue from sales of software games with a service of online activities “online services” mentioned above our allocation of proceeds between product and service revenue for presentation purposes is based on management’s best estimate of the selling price of the online services with the residual value allocated to product revenue our estimate of the selling price of the online services are comprised of several factors including but not limited to prior selling prices for the online services prices charged separately by other thirdparty vendors for similar service offerings and a costplusmargin approach we review the estimated selling price of the online services on a regular basis and use this methodology consistently to allocate revenue between product and service for software game sales with online services 

we evaluate and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met 

 

 

 

 

onlineenabled games 

the majority of our software games and related content have online connectivity whereby a consumer may be able to download unspecified content or updates on a whenandifavailable basis “unspecified updates” for use with the original game software in addition we may also offer a service of online activities eg online playability without a separate fee us gaap requires us to account for the consumer’s right to receive unspecified updates or the service of online activities for no additional fee as a “bundled” sale or multipleelement arrangement 

we have an established historical pattern of providing unspecified updates  eg  player roster updates to madden nfl 17  to onlineenabled games and related content at no additional charge to the consumer because we do not have vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” for these unspecified updates we are required by current us gaap to recognize as revenue the entire sales price of these onlineenabled games and related content over the period we expect to offer the unspecified updates to the consumer “estimated offering period” 

estimated offering period 

because the offering period is not an explicitly defined period we must make an estimate of the offering period determining the estimated offering period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage for example in determining the estimated offering period for unspecified updates associated with our onlineenabled games we consider the period of time consumers are online as online connectivity is required on an annual basis we review consumers’ online gameplay of all onlineenabled games that have been released 12 to 24 months prior to the evaluation date for example if our evaluation date is april 1 2016 we evaluate all onlineenabled games released between april 1 2014 and march 31 2015 based on this population of games for all players that register the game online within the first six months of release of the game to the general public we compute the weightedaverage number of days for each onlineenabled game based on when a player initially registers the game online to when that player last plays the game online we then compute the weightedaverage number of days for all onlineenabled games by multiplying the weightedaverage number of days for each onlineenabled game by its relative percentage of total units sold from these onlineenabled games  ie  a game with more units sold will have a higher weighting to the overall computation than a game with fewer units sold under a similar computation we also consider the estimated period of time between the date a game unit is sold to a reseller and the date the reseller sells the game unit to an end consumer  ie  time in channel based on these two calculations we then consider the method of distribution for example   physical software games sold at retail would have a composite offering period equal to the online gameplay plus time in channel as opposed to digitally distributed software games which are delivered immediately via digital download and thus have no concept of channel additionally we consider results from prior analyses known and expected online gameplay trends as well as disclosed service periods for competitors’ games in determining the estimated offering period for future sales 

while we consistently apply this methodology inherent assumptions used in this methodology include which onlineenabled games to sample whether to use only units that have registered online whether to weight the number of days for each game whether to weight the days based on the units sold of each game determining the period of time between the date of sale to reseller and the date of sale to the consumer and assessing online gameplay trends 

we recognize revenue from the sale of onlineenabled games for which we do not have vsoe for the unspecified updates on a straightline basis generally over an estimated ninemonth period beginning in the month after shipment for physical games sold through retail and an estimated sixmonth period for digitallydistributed games 

deferred net revenue onlineenabled games 

because the majority of our sales are subject to a deferral period of generally six to nine months our deferred net revenue onlineenabled games balance is material this balance increases from period to period by the revenue being deferred for current sales and is reduced by the recognition of revenue from prior sales that were deferred ie the “net change” in the deferred balance however given the seasonal sales nature of our business the net change in the deferred balance may be material from period to period for example because our sales have historically been highest in the fiscal third quarter the deferred net revenue onlineenabled games balance generally increases significantly in the third fiscal quarter similarly because sales have historically been lowest in the first fiscal quarter the deferred net revenue onlineenabled games balance generally decreases significantly in the first fiscal quarter of a fiscal year 

other multipleelement arrangements 

in some of our multipleelement arrangements we sell nonsoftware products with software andor softwarerelated offerings these nonsoftware products are generally music soundtracks peripherals or ancillary collectors’ items such as figurines and comic books revenue for these arrangements is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each deliverable using the relative selling prices of each deliverable in the arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy described below if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable the arrangement consideration is allocated to the software deliverables as a group and then allocated to each software deliverable 

we determine the selling price for a nonsoftware product deliverable based on the following selling price hierarchy vsoe  ie  the price we charge when the nonsoftware product is sold separately if available thirdparty evidence “tpe” of fair value  ie  the price charged by others for similar nonsoftware products if vsoe is not available or our best estimate of selling price “besp” if neither vsoe nor tpe is available determining the besp is a subjective process that is based on multiple factors including but not limited to recent selling prices and related discounts market conditions customer classes sales channels and other factors provided the other three revenue recognition criteria other than delivery have been met we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer as we have no further obligations 

we must make assumptions and judgments in order to 1 determine whether and when each element is delivered 2 determine whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element and 3 allocate the total price among the various elements as applicable changes to any of these assumptions and judgments or changes to the elements in the arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

principal agent considerations 

we evaluate sales of our interactive software games extracontent and services from our subscription offerings via third party storefronts including digital channel storefronts such as microsoft’s xbox store sony’s playstation store apple app store and google play in order to determine whether or not we are acting as the primary obligor in the sale to the end consumer which we consider in determining if revenue should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the storefront key indicators that we evaluate in determining gross versus net treatment include but are not limited to the following 

 based on evaluation of the above indicators we have determined that generally the third party is considered the primary obligor to end consumers for the sale of our interactive software games we therefore report revenue related to these arrangements net of the fees retained by the storefront 

sales returns and allowances and bad debt reserves 

we reduce revenue for estimated future returns and price protection which may occur with our distributors and retailers “channel partners” price protection represents our practice to provide our channel partners with a credit allowance to lower their wholesale price on a particular product that they have not resold to end consumers the amount of the price protection is generally the difference between the old wholesale price and the new reduced wholesale price in certain countries for our pc and console packaged goods software products we also have a practice of allowing channel partners to return older software products in the channel in exchange for a credit allowance as a general practice we do not give cash refunds 

when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances we analyze the following historical credit allowances current sellthrough of our channel partners’ inventory of our software products current trends in retail and the video game industry changes in customer demand acceptance of our software products and other related factors in addition we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection in subsequent periods 

in the future actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold software products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms product updates or competing software products while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters these estimates are inherently subjective accordingly if our estimates change our returns and price protection allowances would change and would impact the total net revenue accounts receivable and deferred net revenue that we report 

we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating the following customer creditworthiness current economic trends historical experience age of current accounts receivable balances and changes in financial condition or payment terms of our customers significant management judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly as a result of a change in any of the evaluation factors mentioned above 

royalties and licenses 

our royalty expenses consist of payments to 1 content licensors 2 independent software developers and 3 copublishing and distribution affiliates license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities professional sports organizations movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks copyrights personal publicity rights content andor other intellectual property royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games copublishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of products 

royaltybased obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid these royaltybased obligations are generally expensed to cost of revenue generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on the total projected net revenue for contracts with guaranteed minimums significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors including 1 the total number of titles subject to the contract 2 the timing of the release of these titles 3 the number of software units and amount of extra content that we expect to sell which can be impacted by a number of variables including product quality number of platforms we release on the timing of the title’s release and competition and 4 future pricing determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products furthermore if we conclude that we are unable to make a reasonably reliable forecast of projected net revenue we recognize royalty expense at the greater of contract rate or on a straightline basis over the term of the contract accordingly if our future revenue projections change our effective royalty rates would change which could impact the amount and timing of royalty expense we recognize 

prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and copublishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product and therefore we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product accordingly payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred payments due after completion of the product primarily royaltybased in nature are generally expensed as cost of revenue 

our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor when performance remains with the licensor we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract 

each quarter we also evaluate the expected future realization of our royaltybased assets as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product and service sales any impairments or losses determined before the launch of a product are generally charged to research and development expense impairments or losses determined postlaunch are charged to cost of revenue we evaluate longlived royaltybased assets for impairment using undiscounted cash flows when impairment indicators exist if impairment exists then the assets are 

written down to fair value unrecognized minimum royaltybased commitments are accounted for as executory contracts and therefore any losses on these commitments are recognized when the underlying intellectual property is abandoned  ie  cease use or the contractual rights to use the intellectual property are terminated 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both 1 the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and 2 the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carryforwards we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified 

in addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities the carryback of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law and the implementation of tax planning strategies evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence this evaluation involves assumptions about future activity 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we realized significant us pretax income for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 as a result we released the valuation allowance against all of the us federal deferred tax assets and a portion of the us state deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we continue to maintain a valuation allowance related to specific us state deferred tax assets and foreign capital loss carryovers due to uncertainty about the future realization of these assets 

prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we considered all undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly no us taxes had been provided thereon during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we reevaluated our intent to indefinitely reinvest all earnings of foreign subsidiary companies and concluded that a portion of earnings of certain subsidiaries will no longer be considered to be indefinitely reinvested we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest a substantial majority of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate these estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation as well as with respect to other matters such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities the ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations in addition changes in our business including acquisitions changes in our international corporate structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix and amount of income as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities valuation allowances applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective tax rate 

recent proposals to lower the us corporate income tax rate would require us to reduce our net deferred tax assets upon 

enactment of new tax legislation with a corresponding onetime noncash increase in income tax expense 

results of operations 

our fiscal year is reported on a 52  or 53 week period that ends on the saturday nearest march 31 our results of operations for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017 and 2015 contained 52  weeks each and ended on april 1 2017 and march 28 2015 respectively our results of operations for the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 contained 53  weeks and ended on april 2 2016 for simplicity of disclosure all fiscal periods are referred to as ending on a calendar month end 

net revenue 

net revenue consists of sales generated from 1 video games sold as digital downloads or as packaged goods and designed for play on game consoles and pcs 2 video games for mobile phones and tablets 3 separate software products and extracontent and online game services associated with these products 4 licensing our game software to third parties 5 allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products and 6 advertisements on our online web pages and in our games we recognize revenue from the sale of onlineenabled games for which we do not have vsoe for the unspecified updates on a straightline basis generally over an estimated sixmonth period for digitallydelivered games and content and an estimated ninemonth period beginning in the month after shipment for physical games sold through retail 

we provide two different measures of our net revenue 1 net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue and 2 net revenue by composition which is primarily based on method of distribution management places a greater emphasis and focus on assessing our business through a review of the net revenue by composition digital and packaged goods and other than by net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue 

comparison of fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2016 

net revenue 

for fiscal year 2017  net revenue was 4845 million  and increased   449 million  or 10 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2016  this increase  was driven by an 809 million increase  in revenue primarily from the star wars battlefield and fifa franchises this increase  was partially offset by a 360 million decrease in revenue primarily from the dragon age the sims and nhl franchises and the simpsons tapped out

supplemental net revenue by composition 

as we continue to evolve our business and more of our products are delivered to consumers digitally we place a greater emphasis and focus on assessing our business performance through a review of net revenue by composition 

our net revenue by composition for fiscal years 2017 and 2016  was as follows in millions 

digital net revenue 

digital net revenue includes full game downloads extra content subscriptions advertising and other and mobile revenue digital net revenue includes game software distributed through our directtoconsumer pc platform origin distributed wirelessly through mobile carriers or licensed to our thirdparty publishing partners who distribute our games digitally 

for fiscal year 2017  digital net revenue was 2874 million  primarily driven by fifa ultimate team  fifa online 3 in asia battlefield 1  and star wars galaxy of heroes  digital net revenue for fiscal year 2017   increased   465 million  or 19 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2016  this increase  is due to 1 a 194 million  or 42 percent   increase  in fullgame download net revenue primarily driven by battlefield 1  and fifa 17  partially offset by battlefield hardline 2   a 142 million  or 13 percent   increase  in extra content net revenue primarily driven by our ultimate team game mode and star wars battlefront  3 an 82 million  or 15 percent   increase  in mobile net revenue primarily driven by star wars galaxy of heroes and   4   a 47 million  or 14 percent   increase  in subscriptions advertising and other net revenue 

packaged goods and other net revenue 

packaged goods and other net revenue includes revenue from software that is distributed physically this includes 1 net revenue from game software distributed physically through traditional channels such as brick and mortar retailers and 2 our software licensing revenue from third parties for example makers of console platforms personal computers or computer accessories who include certain of our products for sale with their products “oem bundles” 

for fiscal year 2017  packaged goods and other net revenue was 1971 million  primarily driven by fifa 17  fifa 16  star wars battlefront  and battlefield 1  packaged goods and other net revenue for fiscal year 2017   decreased   16 million  or 1 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2016  

cost of revenue 

cost of revenue for fiscal years 2017 and 2016  was as follows in millions 



cost of product revenue 

cost of product revenue consists of 1 manufacturing royalties net of volume discounts and other vendor reimbursements 2 certain royalty expenses for celebrities professional sports leagues movie studios and other organizations and independent software developers 3 inventory costs 4 expenses for defective products 5 writeoffs of post launch prepaid royalty costs and losses on previously unrecognized licensed intellectual property commitments 6 amortization of certain intangible assets 

7 personnelrelated costs and 8 warehousing and distribution costs we generally recognize volume discounts when they are earned from the manufacturer typically in connection with the achievement of unitbased milestones whereas other vendor reimbursements are generally recognized as the related revenue is recognized 

cost of product revenue decreased  by 45 million  or 48 percent  in fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  this decrease was driven primarily by a reduction in licensing costs as a result of a change in mix of our titles ie star wars battlefront  was a fiscal 2016 title that had royalties associated with it while battlefield 1  was a fiscal 2017 title that does not bear royalties this was partially offset by the recognition of a 15 million impairment charge on an acquisitionrelated intangible asset as well an increase in royalty costs associated with fifa 17 and titanfall 2  

cost of service and other revenue 

cost of service and other revenue consists primarily of 1 royalty costs 2 data center bandwidth and server costs associated with hosting our online games and websites 3 inventory costs 4 platform processing fees from operating our websitebased games on third party platforms and 5 credit card fees associated with our service revenue 

cost of service and other revenue decreased  by 11 million  or 26 percent  in fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in inventory costs due to the launch of need for speed 2015  during fiscal year 

2016 without a comparable service game launch during fiscal year 2017 partially offset by the recognition of a 10 million impairment charge on a royaltybased asset and an increase in royalty costs associated with fifa ultimate team  and star wars galaxy of heroes during fiscal year 2017  

total cost of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue 

during fiscal year 2017  total cost of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue decreased  by 40 percent  as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2016  this decrease  was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of our digital net revenues to packaged goods and other net revenues as well as lower royalties expense associated with our current year title mix as compared to fiscal year 2016  

research and development 

research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred by our production studios for personnelrelated costs related overhead costs contracted services depreciation and any impairment of prepaid royalties for prelaunch products research and development expenses for our online products include expenses incurred by our studios consisting of direct development and related overhead costs in connection with the development and production of our online games research and development expenses also include expenses associated with our digital platform software licenses and maintenance and management overhead 

research and development expenses for fiscal years 2017 and 2016  were as follows in millions 

research and development expenses increased  by 96 million  or 9 percent  in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 this 96 million increase was primarily due to a 1 41 million increase in contracted services primarily driven by an increase in development advances to thirdparty developers associated with the star wars franchise 2 an aggregate 32 million prelaunch loss on previously unrecognized minimum royaltybased commitments and impairment on royaltybased assets and 3 a 23 million increase in personnelrelated costs primarily resulting from an increase in headcount these increases were partially offset by the quarter ended june 30 2016 containing 13 weeks of personnel costs as compared to 14 weeks in the prior fiscal year as well as a reduction in losses of 10 million from our cash flow hedging program in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 we use hedges to protect against currency exchange rate movements in our research and development expenses 

marketing and sales 

marketing and sales expenses consist of personnelrelated costs related overhead costs advertising marketing and promotional expenses net of qualified advertising cost reimbursements from third parties 

marketing and sales expenses for fiscal years 2017 and 2016  were as follows in millions 

marketing and sales expenses increased  by 51 million  or 8 percent  in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 this 51 million increase was driven by higher advertising expenses associated with our fiscal year 2017 game launches primarily battlefield 1 and  titanfall 2 as compared to advertising expenses associated with our fiscal year 2016 game launches 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related expenses of executive and administrative staff corporate functions such as finance legal human resources and information technology related overhead costs fees for professional services such as legal and accounting and allowances for doubtful accounts 

general and administrative expenses for fiscal years 2017 and 2016  were as follows in millions 

general and administrative expenses increased  by 33 million  or 8 percent  in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 this 33 million increase was primarily due to 1 a 12 million increase in facilityrelated expense primarily due to office expansions 2 a 7 million increase in contracted services primarily due to higher legal expenses and 3 a 6 million increase in personnelrelated costs resulting from an increase in headcount 

income taxes 

provision for benefit from income taxes for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was as follows in millions 

our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 was 201 percent our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2017 differs from the statutory rate of 350 percent primarily due to nonus profits subject to a reduced or zero tax rates the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 differs from fiscal year 2016 primarily due to the reversal of a significant portion of our deferred tax valuation allowance recorded in fiscal year 2016 excluding the impact of the reversal of the valuation allowance our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 would have been 198 percent which differs from the statutory rate of 350 percent primarily due to nonus profits subject to a reduced or zero tax rates 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we realized significant us pretax income for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 as a result we released the valuation allowance against all of the us federal deferred tax assets and a portion of the us state deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 accordingly we recorded a 453 million income tax benefit in fiscal year 2016 for the reversal of a significant portion of our deferred tax valuation allowance 

because of the release of the valuation allowance in fiscal year 2016 we do not anticipate that our effective tax rates for fiscal year 2018 and future periods will be as significantly affected by changes in our deferred tax valuation allowance as they were prior to fiscal year 2017 our effective tax rates for fiscal year 2018 and future periods will continue to depend on a variety of factors including changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions changes in our international structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix of income changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in our annual pretax income or loss with the adoption of asu 201609 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 the inclusion of excess tax benefits and deficiencies as a component of our income tax expense will increase volatility within our provision for income taxes as the amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies from stockbased compensation awards are dependent on our stock price at the date the awards vest 

historically we have considered all undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly no us taxes have been provided thereon during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we reevaluated our intent to indefinitely reinvest all earnings of foreign subsidiary companies and concluded that a portion of 

earnings of certain subsidiaries will no longer be considered to be indefinitely reinvested we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest a substantial majority of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states

in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we realized significant us pretax income for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 as a result we released the valuation allowance against all of the us federal deferred tax assets 

and a portion of the us state deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 accordingly we recorded a 453 million income tax benefit in fiscal year 2016 for the reversal of a significant portion of our deferred tax valuation allowance 

our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 was a tax benefit of 318 percent primarily due to the reversal of the us deferred tax valuation allowance excluding the impact of the reversal of the valuation allowance our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 would have been 198 percent which differs from the statutory rate of 350 percent primarily due to nonus profits subject to a reduced or zero tax rates 

our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2015 differs from the statutory rate of 350 percent as a result of the utilization of us deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation deduction allocated directly to contributed capital and nonus profits subject to a reduced or zero tax rates 

prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we considered all undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly no us taxes had been provided thereon during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we issued the senior notes and announced a 500 million stock repurchase program in light of these future obligations we reevaluated our intent to indefinitely reinvest all earnings of foreign subsidiary companies and concluded that a portion of earnings of certain subsidiaries will no longer be considered to be indefinitely reinvested as a result we recognized a deferred tax liability of 43 million for us income taxes with respect to such earnings we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest a substantial majority of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states

comparison of fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2016 

operating activities  cash provided by operating activities increased 160 million  during fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  the increase is primarily driven by a 385 million increase in sales related to fifa 17 battlefield 1 and  titanfall 2  this was partially offset by a 263 million decrease associated with a net increase in accounts receivable balances as of march 31 2017 as compared to march 31 2016 primarily due to the timing of game launches and higher digital sales during the three months ended march 31 2017 

investing activities  cash used in investing activities increased 275 million  during fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  primarily driven by a 585 million  increase in the purchase of shortterm investments and a 30 million  increase in capital expenditures this was partially offset by a 340 million  increase in proceeds from the sales and maturities of shortterm investments 

financing activities  cash used in financing activities increased 228 million  during fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  primarily due to the of the issuance of senior notes for 989 million  offset by the repurchases of our common stock for 510 million  both of which occurred during fiscal 2016 also we had a 35 million  decrease in proceeds from the exercise of 

stock options and a 21 million  decrease in excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation which were offset by a 307 million  decrease in repayments related to our convertible notes during fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 

cash flow reclassifications  the adoption of asu 201609 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 will require two changes to our cash flow presentation first excess tax benefits are required to be presented as operating activities rather than financing activities second cash payments to taxing authorities in connection with shares withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements are required to be presented as a financing activity because such payments represent an entity’s cash outflow to reacquire the entity’s shares we currently classify cash paid to taxing authorities for shares withheld as an operating activity both of these changes are expected to increase our cash provided by operating activities and increase our cash used in financing activities for more information see part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 1  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements

financing activities  cash used in financing activities increased 51 million during fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 due to a 681 million increase in repurchases of shares of our common stock mainly driven by the repurchase program authorized in february 2016 and 470 million of repayments of our convertible notes in connection with conversions of the convertible notes prior to maturity this was offset by 1 989 million net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes during february 2016 2 a 64 million increase in excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation recognized and 3 a 47 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and espp 

shortterm investments

convertible notes and convertible note hedge

financial condition 

we believe that our cash cash equivalents shortterm investments cash generated from operations and available financing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next 12 months including working capital requirements capital expenditures debt repayment obligations and potentially future acquisitions stock repurchases or strategic investments we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to repay debt strengthen our financial position facilitate expansion repurchase our stock pursue strategic acquisitions and investments andor to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise there can be no assurance however that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms if at all or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 

as of march 31 2017  approximately 28 billion  of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions while we have no plans to repatriate these funds to the united states in the short term if we choose to do so we may be required to accrue and pay additional taxes on any portion of the repatriation where no united states income tax had been previously provided 

in may 2015 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 1 billion  of our common stock we repurchased approximately 65 million  and 69 million  shares for approximately 508 million  and 461 million  under this program respectively during the fiscal years ended march 31 2017 and 2016  as of march 31 2017 31 million remained available for repurchase under this program we completed repurchases under the may 2015 program in april 2017 

in may 2017 a special committee of our board of directors on behalf of the full board of directors authorized a new program to repurchase up to 12 billion of our common stock this stock repurchase program expires on may 31 2019 under this program we may purchase stock in the open market or through privatelynegotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws including pursuant to prearranged stock trading plans the timing and actual amount of the stock repurchases will depend on several factors including price capital availability regulatory requirements alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions we are not obligated to repurchase a specific number of shares under this program and it may be modified suspended or discontinued at any time we are actively repurchasing shares under this program 

we have a “shelf” registration statement on form s3 on file with the sec this shelf registration statement which includes a base prospectus allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus we would use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes including for working capital financing capital expenditures research and development marketing and distribution efforts and if opportunities arise for acquisitions or strategic alliances pending such uses we may invest the net proceeds in interestbearing securities in addition we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time 

our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those related to customer demand and acceptance of our products our ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due successfully achieving our product release schedules and maintaining our live services and attaining our forecasted sales objectives the impact of acquisitions and other strategic transactions in which we may engage the impact of competition economic conditions in the united states and abroad the seasonal and cyclical nature of our business and operating results risks of product returns and the other risks described in the “risk factors” section included in part i item 1a of this report

note 11  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as it relates to our contractual obligations and commercial commitments is incorporated by reference into this item 7

inflation 

we believe the impact of inflation on our results of operations has not been significant in any of the past three fiscal years 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market prices which have experienced significant volatility market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below while we do not hedge our shortterm investment portfolio we protect our shortterm investment portfolio against different market risks including interest rate risk as discussed below our cash and cash equivalents portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for speculative trading purposes and do not hedge our market price risk relating to marketable equity securities if any 

foreign currency exchange risk 

foreign currency exchange rates international sales are a fundamental part of our business and the strengthening of the us dollar particularly relative to the euro british pound sterling australian dollar chinese yuan and south korean won has a negative impact on our reported international net revenue but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses particularly the swedish krona and canadian dollar because these amounts are translated at lower rates as compared to periods in which the us dollar is weaker while we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risk these activities are limited in the protection that they provide us and can themselves result in losses 

cash flow hedging activities  we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreigncurrencydenominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing foreign currency forward contracts that generally have maturities of 18 months  or less these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements in net revenue and research and development expenses 

balance sheet hedging activities  we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk associated with foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily intercompany receivables and payables the foreign currency forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three months or less and are transacted near monthend 

we believe the counterparties to our foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations as of march 31 2017  a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent  or 20 percent  would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value on our foreign currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging of 100 million  or 200 million  respectively as of march 31 2017  a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent  or 20 percent  would have resulted in potential losses on our foreign currency forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of 25 million  or 50 million  respectively this sensitivity analysis assumes an adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates however all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and actual results may differ materially see note 4  derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as it relates to our derivative financial instruments which is incorporated by reference into this item 7a 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities however because shortterm investments mature relatively quickly and if reinvested are invested at the thencurrent market rates interest income on a portfolio consisting of shortterm investments is subject to market fluctuations to a greater extent than a portfolio of longer term investments additionally the contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to call prepay or otherwise settle the investments at prices less than the stated par value our investments are held for purposes other than trading we do not use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio 

as of march 31 2017  our shortterm investments were classified as availableforsale securities and consequently were recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax in stockholders’ equity 

notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations fluctuations in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio the following table presents the hypothetical changes in the fair value of our shortterm investment portfolio as of march 31 2017  arising from potential changes in interest rates the modeling technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps

our strategy 

we have three core strategies 

• players first 

• commitment to digital 

• one ea 

players first 

players are the foundation of our success and we are committed to thinking about players first in everything we do our goal is to build deep ongoing relationships with our players we aim to build these relationships by creating amazing games and services that deliver longlasting fun and enduring value 

our games and services are based on a portfolio of intellectual property that includes established brands such as fifa madden nfl star wars battlefield the sims and need for speed we were the number one publisher on playstation 4 and xbox one consoles and the number four publisher on mobile in the western world for calendar year 2015 based on available sources and ea estimates we achieved this result by delivering popular and awardwinning games to our players including fifa 16 madden nfl 16 star wars battlefront  and battlefield hardline  

commitment to digital 

players increasingly are buying and playing games digitally rather than purchasing discbased games from retailers in addition players are engaging with those games for longer periods of time as they purchase additional content and services that we provide digitally for example features such as the ultimate team mode in our fifa madden nfl and nhl games and digitally delivered expansion packs for our star wars battlefield and sims franchises have extended the life of those games by engaging players over longer periods of time this digital transformation also is creating opportunities in platforms content models and modalities of play for example we have leveraged franchises historically associated with consoles and traditional 

pc gaming such as fifa madden nfl the sims simcity and star wars to create mobile and pc freetodownload games that are monetized through a business model in which we sell incremental content andor features in discrete transactions 

our digital transformation also gives us the opportunity to strengthen our player network we are investing in a technology foundation to enable us to build player relationships that can last for years instead of for days or weeks by connecting our players to us and to each other this connection allows us to market and deliver content and services for popular franchises like fifa battlefield and star wars to our players more efficiently that same foundation also enables new playercentric ways to discover and try new experiences such as our subscriptionbased ea access and origin access services 

we believe that our digital revenue which generally has a higher gross margin relative to packaged goods sales revenue will continue to increase during fiscal year 2017 relative to packaged goods revenue and in absolute terms as we continue to focus on developing and monetizing products and services that can be delivered digitally 

one ea 

the pursuit of our goals requires that we operate as one team that is faster more focused and constantly evolving and we have undertaken a cultural shift across our organization in order to become more flexible we have changed how we develop our games engaging players through alphas betas and other programs to seek out more feedback earlier in the game development process we have also changed the makeup and skill set of our workforce and combined the art of gamemaking with the science of managing dynamic live services and marketing those games and services these changes have enabled us to increase our operational speed and organizational flexibility while improving our fiscal discipline 

our games and services 

we develop games and services for consoles pcs mobile phones and tablets and we market and sell our games and services through retail channels and through digital distribution channels we believe that flexibility across platforms and distribution channels is critical to maintaining and growing our overall consumer base which continues to evolve in response to the introduction of new platforms and business models new gaming platforms engagement models and business models are expected to continue to emerge in the future and we intend to evaluate these new platform engagement and business model opportunities on a casebycase basis 

digitally our console games additional content and online services can be purchased through sony’s playstation network and microsoft’s xbox store our pc games and additional content can be downloaded directly through our origin online platform as well as through thirdparty online download stores our mobile tablet and pc freetodownload games and additional content are available through thirdparty application storefronts such as the apple app store and google play our massively multiplayer online service star wars the old republic  is available both as a freetodownload and as a subscription basis and certain casual games such as card puzzle and word games are available through our pogo online service 

our packaged goods games are sold in mass market retailers such as walmart electronics specialty stores such as best buy and game software specialty stores such as gamestop our direct sales to gamestop corp represented approximately 11 percent and 13 percent of total net revenue in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 respectively we sell our games to gamestop corp pursuant to numerous and frequent individual purchase orders which contain delivery and pricing terms there are no minimum sales or purchase commitments between us and gamestop 

in our games we utilize established brands that we either wholly own such as battlefield mass effect need for speed the sims and plants v zombies or license from others such as fifa madden nfl and star wars from time to time we contract with external game developers such as respawn entertainment to develop our games or to publish and distribute their games we also partner with third parties to publish our mobile and pc games in certain asian territories such as our partnerships with tencent holdings limited and nexon co ltd for fifa online 3  in china and korea respectively we believe that leveraging established brands across a diverse range of genres and platforms enables us to build longterm relationships with a wide variety of players in fiscal year 2016 revenue from sales of fifa 16  represented approximately 16 percent of our total net revenue in fiscal year 2015 revenue from sales of fifa 15  represented approximately 15 percent of our total net revenue and in fiscal year 2014 revenue from sales of fifa 14  represented approximately 15 percent of our total net revenue 

we also are investing in a number of longterm initiatives that we believe will allow us to better serve and deepen our engagement with our players such as our ea competitive gaming division through which we will focus our efforts in competitive gaming and esports

competition 

the market for interactive entertainment is intensely competitive and changes rapidly as new products and platforms are introduced we also face competition for the right to use certain intellectual property included in our products we face significant competition primarily from the following 

 

 

 more broadly we compete against providers of different sources of entertainment such as motion pictures television social networking online casual entertainment and music that our players could enjoy in their free time important competitive factors include game quality and ease of use compatibility of products with certain platforms brand recognition price marketing and quality of customer service

seasonality 

we have historically experienced the highest percentage of our sales in our third fiscal quarter due to seasonal holiday demand however there can be no assurance that this will continue in addition we defer the recognition of a significant amount of net revenue related to our onlineenabled games over an extended period of time as a result the quarter in which we generate the highest sales volume may be different from the quarter in which we recognize the highest amount of net revenue 

employees

risk factors 

tableend 

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs our business or financial performance could be harmed our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe could be material that may harm our business or financial performance 

our business is intensely competitive and “hit” driven if we do not deliver “hit” products and services or if consumers prefer our competitors’ products or services over our own our operating results could suffer 

competition in our industry is intense many new products and services are regularly introduced in each major industry segment console mobile and pc freetodownload but only a relatively small number of “hit” titles account for a significant portion of total revenue in each segment our competitors range from large established companies to emerging startups and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge throughout the world if our competitors develop and market more successful products or services offer competitive products or services at lower price points or if we do not continue to develop consistently highquality and wellreceived products and services our revenue margins and profitability will decline 

we maintain a relatively limited product portfolio in an effort to focus on developing highquality products with the potential to become “hits” highquality titles even if highlyreviewed may not turn into “hit” products many “hit” products within our industry are iterations of prior hit products with large established consumer bases and significant brand recognition which makes competing in certain product categories challenging in addition hit products or services of our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause our products and services to underperform relative to revenue expectations publishing a relatively small number of major titles each year also concentrates risk in those titles and means each major title has greater associated risk the increased importance of extra content and live services revenue to our business heightens this risk as extra content and live services for poorlyreceived or underperforming games may generate lower than expected sales a significant portion of our revenue has historically been derived from games and services based on a few popular franchises for example in fiscal year 2016 net revenue generated from the sale of products and services associated with our three largest franchises accounted for approximately 55 percent of our net revenue the underperformance of a single major title and the associated extra content may have a large adverse impact on our financial results 

our operating results will be adversely affected if we do not consistently meet our product development schedules or if key events sports seasons or movies that we tie our product release schedules to are delayed cancelled or poorly received 

our ability to meet product development schedules is affected by a number of factors both within and outside our control including feedback from our players the creative processes involved the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams the complexity of our products and the platforms for which they are developed the need to finetune our products prior to their release and in certain cases approvals from third parties we have experienced development delays for our products in the past which caused us to delay or cancel release dates we also seek to release certain products in conjunction with key events such as the beginning of a sports season major sporting event or the release of a related movie if such a key event were delayed cancelled or poorly received our sales would likely suffer materially any failure to meet anticipated production or release schedules would likely result in a delay of revenue andor possibly a significant shortfall in our revenue increase our development andor marketing expenses harm our profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different than anticipated 

our business is highly seasonal with the highest percentage of our sales occurring in the quarter ending in december while our sales generally follow this seasonal trend there can be no assurance that this trend will continue if we miss key selling periods for products for any reason including product delays product cancellations or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have developed products our sales are likely to suffer significantly additionally macroeconomic conditions or the occurrence of unforeseen events that negatively impact retailer or consumer buying patterns during the quarter ending in december are likely to harm our financial performance disproportionately 

our business is dependent on the success and availability of platforms developed by third parties as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for these platforms 

the success of our business is driven in part by the commercial success and adequate supply of platforms developed by third parties our success also depends on our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be successful in the marketplace our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for these platforms and our ability to effectively manage the transition from current generation platforms to next generation platforms we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of anticipated platform release dates and may incur significant expense to adjust our product portfolio and development efforts in response to changing consumer platform preferences additionally we may enter into certain exclusive licensing arrangements that affect our ability to deliver or market products or services on certain platforms a platform for which we are developing products and services may not succeed as expected or new platforms may take market share and game software consumers away from platforms for which we have devoted significant resources if consumer demand for the platforms for which we are developing products and services is lower than our expectations we may be unable to fully recover the investments we have made in developing our products and services and our financial performance will be harmed alternatively a platform for which we have not devoted significant resources could be more successful than we had initially anticipated causing us to not be able to take advantage of meaningful revenue opportunities 

technology changes rapidly in our business and if we fail to anticipate or successfully implement new technologies in our games or adopt new business strategies distribution technologies or methods the quality timeliness and competitiveness of our products and services may suffer 

rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate sometimes years in advance which technologies we must implement and take advantage of in order to make our products and services competitive in the market we have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies technologies products and services such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the technology we choose to adopt and the products and services that we pursue will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results we also may miss opportunities to adopt technology or develop products and services that become popular with consumers which could adversely affect our revenues it may take significant time and resources to shift our focus to such technologies putting us at a competitive disadvantage 

our product development usually starts with particular platforms and distribution methods in mind and a range of technical development and game feature goals that we hope to be able to achieve we may not be able to achieve these goals or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly and effectively than we can in either case our products and services may be technologically inferior to our competitors’ less appealing to consumers or both if we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule for our products and services then we may delay their release until these goals can be achieved which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses alternatively we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies either to preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up with our competition which would increase our development expenses 

security breaches and cyber threats could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

as our digital business grows we continually face cyber risks and threats that seek to damage disrupt or gain access to our networks our products and services and supporting infrastructure our business partners including our channel partners also are subject to these risks such cyber risks and threats may be difficult to detect any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or cyber risk could result in interruptions to the services we provide degrade the user experience cause our users to lose confidence in our products as well as significant legal and financial exposure this could harm our business and reputation disrupt our relationships with partners and diminish our competitive position 

successful exploitation of our systems can have other negative effects upon the products services and user experience we offer in particular the virtual economies that we have established in many of our games are subject to abuse exploitation and other forms of fraudulent activity that can negatively impact our business virtual economies involve the use of virtual currency andor virtual assets that can be redeemed by a player within a particular game or game service the abuse or exploitation of our virtual economies include the illegitimate generation and sale of virtual items in black markets our online services have been impacted by ingame exploits and the use of automated processes to generate virtual currency illegitimately in the past which were traded in black markets these kinds of activities and the steps that we take to address these issues may result in a loss of anticipated revenue interfere with players’ enjoyment of a balanced game environment and cause reputational harm 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services that may harm our business 

we are investing and expect to continue to invest in technology hardware and software to support the online functionality of our portfolio of products and services launching and operating games and services with online features developing related technologies and implementing online business initiatives is expensive and complex execution of these initiatives could result in operational failures and other issues impacting the technical stability of our products and services in addition having the necessary infrastructure to support the online functionality of our products and services is vital to our growth and success our products and services could be adversely impacted by outages disruptions and failures in our network and related infrastructure as well as in the online platforms or services of key business partners who offer or support our products and services 

our business is subject to currency fluctuations 

international sales are a fundamental part of our business for our fiscal year ended march 31 2016 international net revenue comprised 57 percent of our total net revenue and we expect international sales to continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue as a result of our international sales and also the denomination of our foreign investments and our cash and cash equivalents in foreign currencies we are exposed to the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates strengthening of the us dollar particularly relative to the euro british pound sterling australian dollar chinese yuan and south korean won has a negative impact on our reported international net revenue but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses particularly when the us dollar strengthens against the swedish krona and the canadian dollar because these amounts are translated at lower rates for example during our fiscal year ended march 31 2016 our reported international revenue would have been 266 million higher and our operating expenses would have been 113 million higher on a constant currency basis we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency risk however these activities are limited in the protection they provide us from foreign currency fluctuations and can themselves result in losses 

declines or fluctuations in the recurring portion of our business may have a negative impact on our financial and operating results 

our business model includes revenue that we deem recurring in nature such as revenue from our annualized titles eg fifa and madden nfl and associated services and ongoing mobile businesses while we are confident in our ability to forecast the revenue from these areas of our business with greater certainty than for new offerings we cannot provide assurances that consumers will purchase these games and services on a consistent basis furthermore we may cease to offer games and services that we previously had deemed to be recurring in nature consumer purchases of our games and services may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their level of satisfaction with our games and services our ability to improve and innovate our annualized titles our ability to adapt our games and services to new platforms outages and disruptions of our online services the games and services offered by our competitors our marketing and advertising efforts or declines in consumer activity generally as a result of economic downturns among others any decline or fluctuation in the recurring portion of our business may have a negative impact on our financial and operating results 

our adoption of new business models could fail to produce our desired financial returns 

from time to time we seek to establish and implement new business models forecasting our revenues and profitability for any new business models is inherently uncertain and volatile our actual revenue and profit for these businesses may be significantly greater or less than our forecasts additionally these new business models could fail resulting in the loss of our investment in the development and infrastructure needed to support these new business models as well as the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from more successful and established businesses 

if we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to include intellectual property owned by others in our games or to maintain or acquire the rights to publish or distribute games developed by others our business may be harmed 

many of our products and services are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our ea sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players’ associations and our star wars products include rights licensed from disney competition for these licenses and rights is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses and rights or obtain additional licenses or rights with significant commercial value our revenue profitability and cash flows may decline significantly competition for these licenses also may increase the amounts that we must pay to licensors and developers through higher minimum guarantees or royalty rates which could significantly increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

if external game developers fail to meet product development schedules or are unable to honor their obligations to us our financial results may be harmed 

we may contract with external game developers to develop our games or to publish or distribute their games while we maintain contractual protections we have less control over the product development schedules of these games developed by external game developers and we depend on their ability to meet product development schedules if these developers cannot meet product development schedules acquire certain approvals or are otherwise unable to honor their obligations to us we may delay or cancel previously announced games which could result in a delay or significant shortfall in anticipated revenue harm our profitability and reputation and cause our financial results to be materially affected 

our business could be adversely affected if our consumer protection data privacy and security practices are not adequate or perceived as being inadequate to prevent data breaches or by the application of consumer protection and data privacy and security laws generally 

in the course of our business we collect process store and use consumer and other information including personal information passwords and credit card information although we take measures to protect this information from unauthorized access acquisition disclosure and misuse our security controls policies and practices may not be able to prevent the improper or unauthorized access acquisition or disclosure of such information in addition third party vendors and business partners which in the course of our business receive access to information that we collect also may not prevent data security breaches with respect to the information we provide them or fully enforce our policies contractual obligations and disclosures regarding the collection use storage transfer and retention of personal data the unauthorized access acquisition or disclosure of this information could significantly harm our reputation compel us to comply with disparate breach notification laws and otherwise subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others and substantial legal liability a perception that we do not adequately secure consumer and other information could result in a loss of current or potential consumers and business partners as well as a loss of anticipated revenues our key business partners also face these risks with respect to information they collect and data security breaches with respect to such information could cause reputational harm to them and negatively impact our ability to offer our products and services through their platforms 

we are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations pursuant to contracts with payment card processors under these rules and obligations if information is compromised we could be liable to payment card issuers for the cost of associated expenses and penalties in addition if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards even if no consumer information is compromised we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs 

in addition data privacy security and consumerprotection laws are evolving and the interpretation and application of these laws in the united states europe and elsewhere are often uncertain contradictory and changing it is possible that these laws may be interpreted or applied in a manner that is adverse to us or otherwise inconsistent with our practices which could result in litigation regulatory investigations and potential legal liability or require us to change our practices in a manner adverse to our business as a result our reputation may be harmed we could incur substantial costs and we could lose both consumers and revenue 

negative player perceptions about our brands products services andor business practices may damage our business and the costs incurred in addressing player concerns may increase our operating expenses 

player expectations regarding the quality performance and integrity of our products and services are high players may be critical of our brands products services andor business practices for a wide variety of reasons these negative player reactions may not be foreseeable or within our control to manage effectively including perceptions about gameplay fairness negative 

player reactions to game content components and services or objections to certain of our business practices in the past we have taken actions including delaying the release of our games and discontinuing services for our games after taking into consideration among other things feedback from the player community even if those decisions negatively impacted our operating results in the short term we expect to continue to take actions to address concerns as appropriate including actions that may result in additional expenditures and the loss of revenue negative player sentiment about our business practices also can lead to investigations from regulatory agencies and consumer groups as well as litigation which regardless of their outcome may be costly damaging to our reputation and harm our business 

if we release defective products or services our operating results could suffer 

our products and services are extremely complex software programs and are difficult to develop and distribute we have quality controls in place to detect defects in our products and services before they are released nonetheless these quality controls are subject to human error overriding and reasonable resource or technical constraints therefore these quality controls and preventative measures may not be effective in detecting all defects in our products and services before they have been released into the marketplace in such an event we could be required to or may find it necessary to offer a refund for the product or service suspend the availability or sale of the product or service or expend significant resources to cure the defect each of which could significantly harm our business and operating results 

during console system transition periods our operating results have been volatile any inability to offset declining sales from legacy generation consoles could negatively impact our operating results 

historically new video game console systems have been developed and released every few years which has caused the video game software market to be cyclical as well in these periods of transition sales of software for legacy generation console systems typically slow or decline in response to the anticipated and actual introduction of new consoles and new generation software sales typically stabilize after new consoles are widely established with the consumer base 

in november 2013 sony released the playstation 4 and microsoft released the xbox one consistent with previous periods of console transition we have seen consumers purchase fewer products and services for legacy generation consoles ie the playstation 3 and xbox 360 respectively as the current generation consoles have gained consumer acceptance during our 2016 fiscal year sales associated with these legacy generation consoles declined significantly and we expect these declines to continue or possible accelerate during our 2017 fiscal year any inability to offset declining sales from legacy generation consoles could negatively impact our operating results 

our business is subject to regulation and the adoption of proposed legislation we oppose could negatively impact our business 

we are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet in addition laws and regulations relating to user privacy data collection retention electronic commerce virtual items and currency consumer protection content advertising localization and information security have been adopted or are being considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world these laws could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our consumers or the manner in which we offer these products the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation furthermore any failure on our part to comply with these laws or the application of these laws in an unanticipated manner may harm our business and result in penalties or significant legal liability 

we are subject to laws in certain foreign countries and adhere to industry standards in the united states that mandate rating requirements or set other restrictions on the advertisement or distribution of interactive entertainment software based on content in addition certain foreign countries allow government censorship of interactive entertainment software products adoption of ratings systems censorship or restrictions on distribution of interactive entertainment software based on content could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers in addition compliance with new and possibly inconsistent regulations for different territories could be costly delay or prevent the release of our products in those territories 

in addition we may include additional competitive modes in our games and manage competitions based on our games and services although we structure and operate these skill based competitions with applicable laws in mind our skill based competitions in the future could become subject to evolving rules and regulations and expose us to significant liability penalties and reputational harm 

if we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel we will be unable to effectively conduct our business 

the market for technical creative marketing and other personnel essential to the development and marketing of our products and services and management of our businesses is extremely competitive our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting our executives as well as key creative and technical talent if we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need or replace key employees following their departure our ability to develop and manage our business will be impaired 

if our marketing and advertising efforts fail to resonate with our customers our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our products and services are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs such as online and mobile advertising television advertising retail merchandising website development event sponsorship and direct communications with our consumers including via email our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part upon the success of these programs if the marketing for our products and services fails to resonate with our customers particularly during the critical holiday season or during other key selling periods or if advertising rates or other media placement costs increase these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

a significant portion of our sales are made to a relatively small number of customers and disruptions to sales through these customers could negatively impact our business 

we derive a significant percentage of our net revenue through sales to our top customers the concentration of a significant percentage of our sales through one or a few large customers could lead to a shortterm disruption to our business if certain of these customers significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to carry our products we also could be more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers became unable to pay for our products or declared bankruptcy additionally receivables from our customers generally increase in our december fiscal quarter as sales of our games and services generally increase in anticipation of the holiday season having a significant portion of our net revenue concentrated in sales through a few customers could reduce our negotiating leverage with these customers if one or more of our key customers experience deterioration in their business or become unable to obtain sufficient financing to maintain their operations our business could be harmed 

our channel partners have significant influence over the products and services that we offer on their platforms 

our agreements with our channel partners typically give them significant control over the approval manufacturing and distribution of the products and services that we develop for their platform in particular our arrangements with sony and microsoft could in certain circumstances leave us unable to get our products and services approved manufactured and distributed to customers for our digital products and services delivered via digital channels such as sony’s playstation network microsoft’s xbox store apple’s app store and the google play store each respective channel partner has policies and guidelines that control the promotion and distribution of these titles and the features and functionalities that we are permitted to offer through the channel moreover certain of our channel partners can determine and change unilaterally certain key terms and conditions including the ability to change their user and developer policies and guidelines in many cases our channel partners also set the rates that we must pay to provide our games and services through their online channels and retain flexibility to change their fee structures or adopt different fee structures for their online channels which could adversely impact our costs profitability and margins if our channel partners establish terms that restrict our offerings through their channels or significantly impact the financial terms on which these products or services are offered to our customers our business could be harmed 

our business is subject to risks generally associated with the entertainment industry any of which could significantly harm our operating results 

our business is subject to risks that are generally associated with the entertainment industry many of which are beyond our control these risks could negatively impact our operating results and include the popularity price and timing of our games economic conditions that adversely affect discretionary consumer spending changes in consumer demographics the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted 

we rely on business partners in many areas of our business and our business may be harmed if they are unable to honor their obligations to us or their actions may put us at risk 

we rely on various business partners including thirdparty service providers vendors licensing partners development partners and licensees in many areas of our business in addition we may have disputes with our business partners that may impact our business andor financial results their actions may put our business and our reputation at risk in many cases our business partners may be given access to sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support to our teams and they may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it in addition the failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies or the failure of the third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies could result in a disruption to our business operations further disruptions in the financial markets economic downturns poor business decisions or reputational harm may adversely affect our business partners and they may not be able to continue honoring their obligations to us or we may cease our arrangements with them alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner or vendor if we lose one or more significant business partners our business could be harmed 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights which could harm our business 

from time to time third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights for example patent holding companies may assert patent claims against us in which they seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained although we take steps to avoid knowingly violating the intellectual property rights of others it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement in addition our products often utilize complex cuttingedge technology that may be subject to intellectual property claims 

existing or future infringement claims against us whether valid or not may be time consuming and expensive to defend such claims or litigations could require us to pay damages and other costs stop selling the affected products redesign those products to avoid infringement or obtain a license all of which could be costly and harm our business in addition many patents have been issued that may apply to potential new modes of delivering playing or monetizing game software products and services such as those that we produce or would like to offer in the future we may discover that future opportunities to provide new and innovative modes of game play and game delivery to consumers may be precluded by existing patents that we are unable to license on reasonable terms 

from time to time we may become involved in other legal proceedings which could adversely affect us 

we are currently and from time to time in the future may become subject to legal proceedings claims litigation and government investigations or inquiries which could be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations in addition the outcome of any legal proceedings claims litigation investigations or inquiries may be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

acquisitions investments divestitures and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and other negative consequences 

we may make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions including 1 acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets 2 minority investments in strategic partners and 3 investments in new interactive entertainment businesses as part of our longterm business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment that we acquire unknown liabilities diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses in addition we may not integrate these businesses successfully including experiencing difficulty in the integration of business systems and technologies the integration and retention of new employees or in the maintenance of key business and customer relationships these events could harm our operating results or financial condition we also may divest or sell assets or a business and we may have difficulty selling such assets or business on acceptable terms in a timely manner this could result in a delay in the achievement of our strategic objectives cause us to incur additional expense or the sale of such assets or business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we anticipated 

our products and brands are subject to the threat of piracy unauthorized copying and other forms of intellectual property infringement 

we regard our products and brands as proprietary and take measures to protect our products brands and other confidential information from infringement we are aware that some unauthorized copying of our products and brands occurs and if a significantly greater amount were to occur it could negatively impact our business 

piracy and other forms of unauthorized copying and use of our content and brands are persistent problems for us and policing is difficult further the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be distributed either do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states or are poorly enforced legal protection of our rights may be ineffective in such countries in addition although we take steps to enforce and police our rights factors such as the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures used in our products the availability of broadband access to the internet the refusal of internet service providers or platform holders to remove infringing content in certain instances and the proliferation of online channels through which infringing product is distributed all have contributed to an expansion in unauthorized copying of our products and brands 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our infrastructure that may harm our business 

we may be subject to outrages or disruptions of our infrastructure including information technology system failures and network disruptions these may be caused by natural disasters cyberincidents weather events power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or other events system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the company’s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could prevent access to our products services or online stores selling our products and services our corporate headquarters in redwood city ca and our studio in burnaby british columbia are located in seismically active regions and certain of our game development activities and other essential business operations are conducted at these locations an event that results in the disruption of any of our critical business or it systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations 

we utilize debt financing and such indebtedness could adversely impact our business and financial condition 

we have 1 billion in senior unsecured notes the “senior notes” and 163 million in convertible senior notes the “convertible notes” outstanding as of march 31 2016 we expect to settle 27 million of the convertible notes during the quarter ended june 30 2016 as a result of conversions prior to maturity by the holders thereof any convertible notes that are not converted prior to maturity will mature in july 2016 we also have an unsecured committed 500 million revolving credit facility while the facility is currently undrawn we may use the proceeds of any future borrowings for general corporate purposes we may enter into other financial instruments in the future 

our indebtedness could affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

 

 

 

the agreements governing our indebtedness impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants in particular the revolving credit facility includes a maximum capitalization ratio and minimum liquidity requirements our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of these covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities as well as the potential costs associated with any potential refinancing our indebtedness downgrades in our credit rating could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing 

in connection with the offering of the convertible notes we entered into certain privatelynegotiated transactions to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the convertible notes we also entered into separate privatelynegotiated warrant transactions whereby we sold warrants to independent third parties the effect of these activities could have an effect on the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes in addition the counterparties to these agreements are financial institutions and we are subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties might default on the transactions 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision tax assets and accruals for other taxes and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by our profit levels by changes in our business reorganization of our business and operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the elections we make changes in applicable tax laws or changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as well as other factors we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions furthermore we are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities with respect to both income and such other nonincome taxes adverse changes in our effective income tax rate unfavorable audit results or tax rulings or other changes resulting in significant additional tax liabilities could have material adverse effects upon our earnings cash flows and financial condition 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in   financial accounting standards 

our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting standards promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies for example accounting standards affecting software revenue recognition have affected and could continue to significantly affect the way we account for revenue and costs related to our products and services we recognize all of the revenue from bundled sales ie onlineenabled games that include updates on a whenandifavailable basis or a matchmaking service on a deferred basis over an estimated offering period the related costs of revenues are expensed as incurred instead of deferred and recognized ratably in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  which will replace existing revenue recognition guidance in us gaap when it becomes effective while we have not yet determined the effect of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements we believe the new standard may require us to materially change the way we account for revenue by requiring us to recognize more revenue upon delivery of the primary product than we currently do under current accounting standards the new standard may also require us to materially change the way we account for related costs by requiring us to capitalize and amortize certain costs over the period the related assets are transferred to the customer 

as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue costs and taxes could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors above as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts’ earnings estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts’ and investors’ expectations to factors affecting the entertainment computer software internet media or electronics industries to our ability to successfully integrate any acquisitions we may make or to national or international economic conditions in particular economic downturns may contribute to the public stock markets experiencing extreme price and trading volume volatility these broad market fluctuations have and could continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following overview is a highlevel discussion of our operating results as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers provides important context for our results for the fiscal year ended march 31 2016  as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form 10k including in the “business” section and the “risk factors” above the remainder of this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda”” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

about electronic arts 

we are a global leader in digital interactive entertainment we develop market publish and distribute games content and services that can be played by consumers on a variety of platforms which include consoles such as the playstation from sony and the xbox from microsoft pcs mobile phones and tablets some of our games are based on our whollyowned intellectual property  eg  battlefield mass effect need for speed the sims and plants vs zombies and some of our games leverage content that we license from others  eg  fifa madden nfl and star wars we also publish and distribute games developed by third parties eg titanfall   our products and services may be purchased through multiple distribution channels including physical and online retailers platform providers such as console manufacturers providers of freetodownload pc games mobile carriers and directly through origin our own digital distribution platform 

financial results 

our key financial results for our fiscal year ended march 31 2016  were as follows 

 

trends in our business 

digital transformation  our business continues to transform from a traditional packaged goods business model to one in which our games and services are sold and delivered digitally with additional content features and services helping to extend the life of our packaged goods and digital games for example the ultimate team mode incorporated into iterations of our fifa madden nfl and nhl franchises and expansion packs available digitally for our star wars battlefield and sims franchises have kept many of our players engaged with those games for longer periods of time our digital transformation is also creating opportunities in platforms content models and modalities of play for example we have leveraged franchises typically associated with consoles and traditional pc gaming such as fifa madden nfl the sims simcity and star wars to create mobile and pc freetodownload games that are monetized through a business model through which we sell incremental content andor features in discrete transactions we also provide our ea access service for the xbox one and origin access service on pc which offer players access to a selection of ea games and other benefits for a monthly or annual fee 

our digital transformation also gives us the opportunity to strengthen our player network we are investing in a technology foundation to enable us to build player relationships that can last for years instead of for days or weeks by connecting our players to us and to each other this connection allows us to market and deliver content and services for popular franchises like fifa battlefield and star wars to our players more efficiently that same foundation also enables new playercentric ways to discover and try new experiences such as our subscriptionbased ea access and origin access services 

we significantly increased our digital net revenue from 1833 million in fiscal year 2014 to 2199 million in fiscal year 2015 and 2409 million  during fiscal year 2016 we expect this portion of our business to continue to grow through fiscal year 2017 and beyond as we continue to focus on developing and monetizing products and services that can be delivered digitally 

foreign currency exchange rates international sales are a fundamental part of our business and the strengthening of the us dollar particularly relative to the euro british pound sterling australian dollar chinese yuan and south korean won has a negative impact on our reported international net revenue but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses particularly the swedish krona and canadian dollar because these amounts are translated at lower rates as compared to periods in which the us dollar is weaker while we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risk these activities are limited in the protection that they provide us and can themselves result in losses we estimate that foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact of 266 million on our reported net revenue during fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 but the strengthening of the us dollar had a positive impact of 113 million on our reported operating expenses as a significant portion of those expenses are incurred outside the united states 

mobile and pc freetodownload games  the proliferation of mobile phones and tablets has significantly increased the consumer base for mobile games the broad consumer acceptance of business models which allow consumers to try new games with no upfront cost and pay for additional content or ingame items has led to growth in the mobile gaming industry likewise the mass introduction and wide consumer acceptance of freetodownload microtransactionbased pc games played over the internet has also broadened our consumer base we expect revenue generated from mobile and pc freetodownload games to remain an important part of our business 

we track an estimate of monthly active users “maus” for our mobile business which we believe is a useful indicator of player engagement trends for that business for the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 we had average maus of over 160 million maus are the aggregate number of individuals who accessed a particular game on a particular device in the last 30 days as of the measurement date for our calculation an individual who either plays two of our games on a single device or the same game on two devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users average maus for a particular period is the average of the maus at each monthend during that period maus are calculated using internal company data based on tracking the activity of user accounts we also include in this calculation data provided by our third party publishing partners for certain games that we develop but we exclude information from third party titles that we publish from time to time we adjust the calculation for user activity that is inconsistent with our methodology we believe that the numbers are reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement however factors relating to user activity may impact these numbers our methodology for calculating maus may differ from the methodology used by other companies to calculate this metric 

concentration of sales among the most popular games  in all major segments of our industry we see a large portion of games sales concentrated on the most popular titles and many of those titles are sequels of prior games similarly a significant portion of our revenue historically has been derived from games and services based on a few popular franchises several of which we have released on an annual or biannual basis for example in fiscal year 2016 net revenue generated from the sale of products and services associated with our three largest franchises accounted for approximately 55 percent  of our net revenue we expect this trend to continue 

recurring revenue sources our business model includes revenue that we deem recurring in nature such as revenue from our annualized titles such as fifa and madden nfl and associated services our ongoing mobile business and subscription programs we have greater confidence in our ability to forecast revenue from these areas of our business than for new offerings as we continue to leverage the digital transformation in our industry and incorporate new content models and modalities of play into our games our goal is to continue to look for opportunities to expand the recurring portion of our business 

recent developments 

stock repurchase program in may 2015 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 1 billion of our common stock this stock repurchase program expires on may 31 2017 during the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 we repurchased approximately 69 million  shares for approximately 461 million  under the may 2015 program we continue to actively repurchase shares under this program 

on february 3 2016 our board of directors authorized a new program to repurchase up to 500 million of ea’s common stock this program was incremental to the may 2015 program we have completed repurchases under the february 2016 program repurchasing 78 million  shares for approximately 500 million  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities contingent assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown as a result actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

revenue recognition sales returns and allowances and bad debt reserves 

we derive revenue principally from sales of interactive software games and related content  eg  microtransactions and services on consoles such as the playstation from sony and the xbox from microsoft pcs mobile phones and tablets we evaluate revenue recognition based on the criteria set forth in fasb accounting standards codification “asc” 605 revenue recognition and asc 985605 software revenue recognition  we classify our revenue as either product revenue or service and other revenue 

product revenue  our product revenue includes revenue associated with the sale of software games or related content whether delivered via a physical disc  e  g  packaged goods or delivered digitally  eg  fullgame downloads extracontent and licensing of game software to thirdparties product revenue also includes revenue from mobile fullgame downloads that do not require our hosting support  eg  premium mobile games in order to utilize the game or related content  ie can be played with or without an internet connection and sales of tangible products such as hardware peripherals or collectors’ items 

service and other revenue  our service revenue includes revenue recognized from timebased subscriptions and games or related content that requires our hosting support in order to utilize the game or related content  ie  can only be played with an internet connection this includes 1 entitlements to content that are accessed through hosting services  eg  microtransactions for internetbased social network and freetodownload mobile games 2 massively multiplayer online “mmo” games both software game and subscription sales 3 subscriptions for our battlefield premium ea access and pogobranded online game services and 4 allocated service revenue from sales of software games with an online service element  ie “matchmaking” service our other revenue includes advertising and nonsoftware licensing revenue 

with respect to the allocated service revenue from sales of software games with a matchmaking service mentioned above our allocation of proceeds between product and service revenue for presentation purposes is based on management’s best estimate of the selling price of the matchmaking service with the residual value allocated to product revenue our estimate of the selling price of the matchmaking service is comprised of several factors including but not limited to prior selling prices for the matchmaking service prices charged separately by other thirdparty vendors for similar service offerings and a costplusmargin approach we review the estimated selling price of the online matchmaking service on a regular basis and use this methodology consistently to allocate revenue between product and service for software game sales with a matchmaking service 

we evaluate and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met 

 

 

 

 

onlineenabled games 

the majority of our software games and related content have online connectivity whereby a consumer may be able to download unspecified content or updates on a whenandifavailable basis “unspecified updates” for use with the original game software in addition we may also offer an online matchmaking service that permits consumers to play against each other via the internet without a separate fee us gaap requires us to account for the consumer’s right to receive unspecified updates or the matchmaking service for no additional fee as a “bundled” sale or multipleelement arrangement 

we have an established historical pattern of providing unspecified updates  eg  player roster updates to madden nfl 16  to onlineenabled games and related content at no additional charge to the consumer we do not have vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” for these unspecified updates and thus as required by us gaap we recognize revenue from the sale of these onlineenabled games and related content over the period we expect to offer the unspecified updates to the consumer “estimated offering period” 

estimated offering period 

because the offering period is not an explicitly defined period we must make an estimate of the offering period determining the estimated offering period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage for example in determining the estimated offering period for unspecified updates associated with our onlineenabled games we consider the period of time consumers are online as online connectivity is required on an annual basis we review consumers’ online gameplay of all onlineenabled games that have been released 12 to 24 months prior to the evaluation date for example if our evaluation date is april 1 2015 we evaluate all onlineenabled games released between april 1 2013 and march 31 2014 based on this population of games for all players that register the game online within the first six months of release of the game to the general public we compute the weightedaverage number of days for each onlineenabled game based on when a player initially registers the game online to when that player last plays the game online we then compute the weightedaverage number of days for all onlineenabled games by multiplying the weightedaverage number of days for each onlineenabled game by its relative percentage of total units sold from these onlineenabled games  ie  a game with more units sold will have a higher weighting to the overall computation than a game with fewer units sold under a similar computation we also consider the estimated period of time between the date a game unit is sold to a reseller and the date the reseller sells the game unit to an end consumer  ie  time in channel based on these two calculations we then consider the method of distribution for example   physical software games sold at retail would have a composite offering period equal to the online gameplay plus time in channel as opposed to digitally distributed software games which are delivered immediately via digital download and thus have no concept of channel additionally we consider results from prior analyses known and expected online gameplay trends as well as disclosed service periods for competitors’ games in determining the estimated offering period for future sales 

while we consistently apply this methodology inherent assumptions used in this methodology include which onlineenabled games to sample whether to use only units that have registered online whether to weight the number of days for each game whether to weight the days based on the units sold of each game determining the period of time between the date of sale to reseller and the date of sale to the consumer and assessing online gameplay trends 

other multipleelement arrangements 

in some of our multipleelement arrangements we sell tangible products with software andor softwarerelated offerings these tangible products are generally either peripherals or ancillary collectors’ items such as figurines and comic books revenue for these arrangements is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each deliverable using the relative selling prices of each deliverable in the arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy described below if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable the arrangement consideration is allocated to the software deliverables as a group and then allocated to each software deliverable 

we determine the selling price for a tangible product deliverable based on the following selling price hierarchy vsoe  ie  the price we charge when the tangible product is sold separately if available thirdparty evidence “tpe” of fair value  ie  the price charged by others for similar tangible products if vsoe is not available or our best estimate of selling price “besp” if neither vsoe nor tpe is available determining the besp is a subjective process that is based on multiple factors including but not limited to recent selling prices and related discounts market conditions customer classes sales channels and other factors provided the other three revenue recognition criteria other than delivery have been met we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer as we have no further obligations 

we must make assumptions and judgments in order to 1 determine whether and when each element is delivered 2 determine whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element and 3 allocate the total price among the various elements as applicable changes to any of these assumptions and judgments or changes to the elements in the arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

principal agent considerations 

we evaluate sales of our interactive software games via third party storefronts including digital storefronts such as microsoft’s xbox games store sony psn apple app store and google play in order to determine whether or not we are acting as the primary obligor in the sale to the end consumer which we consider in determining if revenue should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the storefront key indicators that we evaluate in determining gross versus net treatment include but are not limited to the following 

 based on evaluation of the above indicators we have determined that generally the third party is considered the primary obligor to end consumers for the sale of our interactive software games we therefore report revenue related to these arrangements net of the fees retained by the storefront 

sales returns and allowances and bad debt reserves 

we reduce revenue for estimated future returns and price protection which may occur with our distributors and retailers “channel partners” price protection represents our practice to provide our channel partners with a credit allowance to lower their wholesale price on a particular product that they have not resold to end consumers the amount of the price protection is generally the difference between the old wholesale price and the new reduced wholesale price in certain countries for our pc and console packaged goods software products we also have a practice of allowing channel partners to return older software products in the channel in exchange for a credit allowance as a general practice we do not give cash refunds 

when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances we analyze the following historical credit allowances current sellthrough of our channel partners’ inventory of our software products current trends in retail and the video game industry changes in customer demand acceptance of our software products and other related factors in addition we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection in subsequent periods 

in the future actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold software products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms product updates or competing software products while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters these estimates are inherently subjective accordingly if our estimates change our returns and price protection allowances would change and would impact the total net revenue accounts receivable and deferred net revenue that we report 

we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating the following customer creditworthiness current economic trends historical experience age of current accounts receivable balances and changes in financial condition or payment terms of our customers significant management judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly as a result of a change in any of the evaluation factors mentioned above

our royalty expenses consist of payments to 1 content licensors 2 independent software developers and 3 copublishing and distribution affiliates license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities professional sports organizations movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks copyrights personal publicity rights content andor other intellectual property royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games copublishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of products 

royaltybased obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid these royaltybased obligations are generally expensed to cost of revenue generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on the total projected net revenue for contracts with guaranteed minimums significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors including 1 the total number of titles subject to the contract 2 the timing of the release of these titles 3 the number of software units and amount of extra content that we expect to sell which can be impacted by a number of variables including product quality number of platforms we release on the timing of the title’s release and competition and 4 future pricing determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products furthermore if we conclude that we are unable to make a reasonably reliable forecast of projected net revenue we recognize royalty expense at the greater of contract rate or on a straightline basis over the term of the contract accordingly if our future revenue projections change our effective royalty rates would change which could impact the amount and timing of royalty expense we recognize 

prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and copublishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product and therefore we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product accordingly payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred payments due after completion of the product primarily royaltybased in nature are generally expensed as cost of revenue 

our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor when performance remains with the licensor we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract royalty liabilities are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next 12 months 

each quarter we also evaluate the expected future realization of our royaltybased assets as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product and service sales any impairments or losses determined before the launch of a product are generally charged to research and development expense impairments or losses determined postlaunch are charged to cost of revenue we evaluate longlived royaltybased assets for impairment using undiscounted cash flows when impairment indicators exist if impairment exists then the assets are written down to fair value unrecognized minimum royaltybased commitments are accounted for as executory contracts and therefore any losses on these commitments are recognized when the underlying intellectual property is abandoned  ie  cease use or the contractual rights to use the intellectual property are terminated 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both 1 the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and 2 the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carryforwards we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified it is generally difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is significant negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years forecasts of future taxable income are considered to be less objective than past results therefore cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 

in addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities the carry back of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law and the implementation of tax planning strategies evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence this evaluation involves assumptions about future activity certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets 

from the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 to the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 we maintained a 100 valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets because there was insufficient positive evidence to overcome the existing negative evidence such that it was not more likely than not that the us deferred tax assets were realizable while we reported us pretax income in fiscal year 2015 because we reported us pretax losses during the previous seven fiscal years as well as in the 

second and third quarters of fiscal year 2016 we continued to maintain the 100 valuation allowance through the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we realized significant us pretax income for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 as of march 31 2016 we had reported positive operating performance in the us for two consecutive fiscal years and had also reported a cumulative threeyear us pretax profit in addition during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we completed our financial plan for fiscal year 2017 and expect continued positive operating performance in the us we also considered forecasts of future taxable income and evaluated the utilization of tax credit carryforwards prior to their expiration after considering these factors we determined that the positive evidence overcame any negative evidence and concluded that it was more likely than not that the us deferred tax assets were realizable as a result we released the valuation allowance against all of the us federal deferred tax assets and a portion of the us state deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 accordingly we recorded a 453 million income tax benefit in fiscal year 2016 for the reversal of a significant portion of our deferred tax valuation allowance 

as of march 31 2016 we maintained a valuation allowance of 114 million primarily related to specific us state deferred tax assets and foreign capital loss carryovers due to uncertainty about the future realization of these assets in determining the amount of deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized we evaluated the potential to realize the assets through the utilization of tax loss and credit carrybacks the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and certain tax planning strategies 

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate these estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation as well as with respect to other matters such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities the ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations in addition changes in our business including acquisitions changes in our international corporate structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix and amount of income as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities valuation allowances applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate

income taxes 

provision for benefit from income taxes for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 was as follows in millions

prior to fiscal year 2016 our effective income tax rates have been significantly affected by the us valuation allowance as a result of the release of the valuation allowance in fiscal year 2016 we do not anticipate that our effective income tax rates for fiscal year 2017 and future periods will be as significantly affected by changes in our deferred tax valuation allowance as they were prior to fiscal year 2017 our effective income tax rates for fiscal year 2017 and future periods will continue to depend on a variety of factors including changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions changes in our international structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix of income changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in our annual pretax income or loss we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our pretax consolidated income or loss as a result in absolute dollar terms our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pretax income or loss than at higher levels in addition at lower levels of pretax income or loss our effective tax rate will be more volatile 

historically we have considered all undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly no us taxes have been provided thereon during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we issued the senior notes and announced a 500 million stock repurchase program in light of these future obligations we reevaluated our intent to indefinitely reinvest all earnings of foreign subsidiary companies and concluded that a portion of earnings of certain subsidiaries will no longer be considered to be indefinitely reinvested as a result we have recognized a deferred tax liability of 43 million for us income taxes with respect to such earnings we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest a substantial majority of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states

due to our mix of fixed and variable rate securities our shortterm investment portfolio is susceptible to changes in shortterm interest rates as of march 31 2016  our shortterm investments had gross unrealized gains of 2 million  or less than 1 percent of the total in shortterm investments and gross unrealized losses of less than 1 million  or less than 1 percent of the total in shortterm investments from time to time we may liquidate some or all of our shortterm investments to fund operational needs or other activities such as capital expenditures business acquisitions or stock repurchase programs depending on which shortterm investments we liquidate to fund these activities we could recognize a portion or all of the gross unrealized gains or losses 

convertible notes and convertible note hedge 

in july 2011  we issued 6325 million  aggregate principal amount of 075  convertible senior notes due 2016  the “convertible notes” of which 163 million aggregate principal amount remained outstanding as of march 31 2016 the convertible notes will mature on july 15 2016 unless purchased earlier or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date 

the convertible notes are convertible at the option of the holder through july 13 2016 during fiscal year 2016 approximately 497 million  principal value of the convertible notes were converted by holders thereof during fiscal year 2016 we repaid 470 million  principal balance of the convertible notes and issued approximately 78 million  shares of common stock to noteholders with a fair value of 518 million  resulting in a loss on extinguishment of 10 million  we also received and cancelled approximately 78 million  shares of common stock from the exercise of the convertible note hedge during fiscal year 2016 

subsequent to the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 and through may 23 2016 we received an immaterial amount of conversion requests for the convertible notes during the quarter ending june 30 2016 we expect to settle conversion requests with 27 million in cash and a number of shares of our common stock equal in value to the excess conversion value based on the closing price of our common stock of 6592 at the end of the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 approximately 04 million shares of our common stock would be issuable to converting holders the actual amount of shares issuable upon conversion will be determined based upon the market price of our common stock during an observation period following any conversion 

warrants 

we have outstanding warrants with independent third parties to acquire up to 199 million  shares of our common stock which is also equal to the number of shares of our common stock that notionally underlie the convertible notes with a strike price of 4114  the warrants have a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds 4114  on or prior to the expiration date of the warrants the warrants automatically exercises over a 60 trading day period beginning on october 17 2016 based on the closing price of our common stock of 6592 at the end of the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 approximately 75 million shares of our common stock would be issuable to warrant holders the actual amount of shares issuable upon exercise will be determined based upon the market price of our common stock during the 60 day trading period beginning on october 17 2016

senior notes 

in february 2016 we issued 600 million aggregate principal amount of 370 senior notes due march 1 2021 the “2021 notes” and 400 million aggregate principal amount of 480 senior notes due march 1 2026 the “2026 notes” and together with the 2021 notes the “senior notes” we used the net proceeds of 989 million for general corporate purposes including the payment of amounts due upon conversion of our convertible notes and the repurchase of our common stock including under the 500 million stock repurchase program approved in february 2016 the effective interest rate was 394 for the 2021 notes and 497 for the 2026 notes interest is payable semiannually in arrears on march 1 and september 1 of each year beginning on september 1 2016 see note 12  financing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as it relates to our senior notes which is incorporated by reference into this item 7 

credit facility 

in march 19 2015  we entered into a 500 million  senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks as of march 31 2016  no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility see note 12  financing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as it relates to our credit facility which is incorporated by reference into this item 7 

financial condition 

we believe that our cash cash equivalents shortterm investments cash generated from operations and available financing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next 12 months including working capital requirements capital expenditures debt repayment obligations and potentially future acquisitions stock repurchases or strategic investments we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to repay debt strengthen our financial position facilitate expansion repurchase our stock pursue strategic acquisitions and investments andor to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise there can be no assurance however that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms if at all or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 

as of march 31 2016  approximately 2 billion  of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions while we have no plans to repatriate these funds to the united states in the short term if we choose to do so we may be required to accrue and pay additional taxes on any portion of the repatriation where no united states income tax had been previously provided 

in may 2014 a special committee of our board of directors on behalf of the full board of directors authorized a twoyear program to repurchase up to 750 million  of our common stock since inception we repurchased approximately 92 million  shares for approximately 394 million  under this program 

in may 2015 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 1 billion  of our common stock this stock repurchase program which expires on may 31 2017 supersedes and replaces the stock repurchase authorization approved in may 2014 under the may 2015 program we may purchase stock in the open market or through privatelynegotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws including pursuant to prearranged stock trading plans the timing and actual amount of the stock repurchases will depend on several factors including price capital availability regulatory requirements alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions we are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares under this program and it may be modified suspended or discontinued at any time 

during fiscal year 2016  we repurchased approximately 10 million  shares for approximately 57 million  under the may 2014 program and we repurchased approximately 69 million  shares for approximately 461 million  under the may 2015 program we continue to actively repurchase shares under the may 2015 program 

in february 2016 we announced a new 500 million stock repurchase program this new program was incremental to the existing twoyear 1 billion stock repurchase program announced in may 2015 we completed repurchases under the february 2016 program during the quarter ended march 31 2016  we repurchased approximately 78 million  shares for approximately 500 million  under this new program 

we have a “shelf” registration statement on form s3 on file with the sec this shelf registration statement which includes a base prospectus allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus we would use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes including for working capital financing capital expenditures research and development marketing and distribution efforts and if opportunities arise for acquisitions or strategic alliances pending such uses we may invest the net proceeds in interestbearing securities in addition we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time 

our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those related to customer demand and acceptance of our products our ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due successfully achieving our product release schedules and attaining our forecasted sales objectives the impact of acquisitions and other strategic transactions in which we may engage the impact of competition economic conditions in the united states and abroad the seasonal and cyclical nature of our business and operating results risks of product returns and the other risks described in the “risk factors” section included in part i item 1a of this report 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

note 13  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as it relates to our contractual obligations and commercial commitments is incorporated by reference into this item 7 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of march 31 2016  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk promulgated by the sec that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues and expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 

inflation 

we believe the impact of inflation on our results of operations has not been significant in any of the past three fiscal years 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market prices which have experienced significant volatility market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below while we do not hedge our shortterm investment portfolio we protect our shortterm investment portfolio against different market risks including interest rate risk as discussed below our cash and cash equivalents portfolio consists of highly liquid investments 

with insignificant interest rate risk and original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for speculative trading purposes and do not hedge our market price risk relating to marketable equity securities if any 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency exchange rates international sales are a fundamental part of our business and the strengthening of the us dollar particularly relative to the euro british pound sterling australian dollar chinese yuan and south korea won has a negative impact on our reported international net revenue but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses particularly the swedish krona and canadian dollar because these amounts are translated at lower rates as compared to periods in which the us dollar is weaker while we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risk these activities are limited in the protection that they provide us and can themselves result in losses foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on our reported net revenue during fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 but the strengthening of the us dollar had a positive impact on our reported operating expenses as a significant portion of those expenses are incurred outside the united states 

cash flow hedging activities  from time to time we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreigncurrencydenominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing foreign currency forward contracts that generally have maturities of 18 months  or less these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements in net revenue and research and development expenses 

balance sheet hedging activities  we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily intercompany receivables and payables the foreign currency forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three months or less and are transacted near monthend 

we believe the counterparties to our foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations as of march 31 2016  a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent  or 20 percent  would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value on our foreign currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging of 83 million  and 167 million  respectively as of march 31 2016  a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent  or 20 percent  would have resulted in potential losses on our foreign currency forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of 27 million  and 53 million  respectively this sensitivity analysis assumes an adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates however all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and actual results may differ materially see note 4  derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as it relates to our derivative financial instruments which is incorporated by reference into this item 7a 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities however because shortterm investments mature relatively quickly and are required to be reinvested at the thencurrent market rates interest income on a portfolio consisting of shortterm investments is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term investments additionally the contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to call prepay or otherwise settle the investments at prices less than the stated par value our investments are held for purposes other than trading also we do not use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio 

as of march 31 2016  our shortterm investments were classified as availableforsale securities and consequently were recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in stockholders’ equity 

notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations at any time a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio the following table presents the hypothetical changes in the fair value of our shortterm investment portfolio as of march 31 2016  arising from potential changes in interest rates the modeling technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps

overview 

we develop market publish and distribute game software content and services that can be played by consumers on a variety of platforms including game consoles such as the playstation 3 and playstation 4 from sony and xbox 360 and xbox one from microsoft pcs mobile phones and tablets 

our strategy 

we have three core strategies 

• players first 

• commitment to digital 

• one ea 

players first 

players are the foundation of our success and we are committed to thinking about players first in everything we do our goal is to build deep ongoing relationships with our players we aim to build these relationships by creating amazing games and services that deliver longlasting fun and enduring value 

our games and services are based on a portfolio of intellectual property that includes established brands such as madden nfl fifa battlefield dragon age sims and need for speed in calendar year 2014 we were the top publisher on both xbox one and playstation 4 we achieved this result by delivering awardwinning games to our players including dragon age inquisition which was named “game of the year” by numerous media outlets including ign game informer and the associated press meanwhile during fiscal year 2015 we averaged over 165 million monthly active users “maus” on our mobile titles information regarding our maus is provided under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 

commitment to digital 

players increasingly are buying and playing games digitally rather than purchasing discbased games from retailers in addition players are engaging with those games for longer periods of time as they purchase additional content and services that we provide digitally this digital transformation is creating new opportunities in platforms content models and modalities of play for example we offer digitally delivered expansion packs for our battlefield and sims franchises similarly the ultimate team feature in our fifa madden nfl nhl and nba games has extended the life of those games by engaging players over longer periods of time 

we are investing in a digital platform a technology foundation to enable us to deliver content and services for franchises like fifa and battlefield while building player relationships that can last for years instead of for days or weeks that same foundation also enables new playercentric ways to discover and try new experiences such as ea access and several offerings associated with our origin service including our great game guarantee and on the house programs we believe that our 

digital revenue which is generally highermargin relative to packaged goods sales revenue will continue to increase during fiscal year 2016 relative to packaged goods revenue and in absolute terms 

our players can access our digitallydelivered games and services through several mechanisms console games additional content and enhanced online services can be purchased directly through sony’s playstation network and microsoft’s xbox live marketplace our pc games and additional content can be downloaded directly through our origin online platform as well as through thirdparty online download stores our mobile tablet and pc freetodownload games and additional content are available through wireless and online delivery and our large scale massively multiplayer online service is available on a freetodownload and subscription basis 

one ea 

the pursuit of our goals requires that we operate as one team that is faster more focused and constantly evolving and we are undertaking a cultural shift in our operations and development process in order to become a more flexible organization we are changing how we develop our games engaging players through alphas betas and other programs to seek out more feedback earlier in the game development process we are also changing the makeup and skill set of our workforce and combining the art of gamemaking with the science of managing dynamic live services these changes have enabled us to continue to increase our operational speed while improving our fiscal discipline 

our brands and platforms 

in our games we utilize established brands that we either wholly own such as battlefield dragon age the sims and plants v zombies or license from others eg fifa madden nfl and star wars leveraging these brands across a diverse range of genres from casual to roleplaying to sports simulation enables us to build ongoing relationships with a wide audience across a broad range of platforms 

we have the ability to deliver our products and services to our consumers across multiple platforms including consoles mobile phones tablets and pcs both through downloads via our origin portal and through freetodownload games that can be played directly over the internet we believe this flexibility is critical to maintaining and growing our overall consumer base which continues to evolve in response to the introduction of new platforms and platform business models in particular we are expanding the use of popular brands historically associated with console platforms such as fifa and madden nfl to mobile platforms 

new gaming platforms are expected to continue to emerge in the future we intend to evaluate new platform publishing opportunities on a casebycase basis as they emerge

seasonality 

our business is highly seasonal with the highest levels of consumer demand and a significant percentage of our sales occurring in the holiday season quarter ending in december and a seasonal low in sales volume in the quarter ending in june while our sales generally follow this seasonal trend there can be no assurance that this trend will continue in addition we defer the recognition of a significant amount of net revenue related to our onlineenabled games over an extended period of time as a result the quarter in which we generate the highest sales volume may be different from the quarter in which we recognize the highest amount of net revenue our results also can vary based on a number of factors including title release dates cancellation or delay of a key event or sports season to which our product release schedule is tied consumer demand for our products shipment schedules content offerings and our revenue recognition policies

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs our business or financial performance could be harmed our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe could be material that may harm our business or financial performance 

our business is intensely competitive and “hit” driven if we do not deliver “hit” products and services or if consumers prefer our competitors’ products or services over our own our operating results could suffer 

competition in our industry is intense many new products and services are regularly introduced in each major industry segment console mobile and pc freetodownload but only a relatively small number of “hit” titles account for a significant portion of total revenue in each segment our competitors range from large established companies to emerging startups and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge throughout the world if our competitors develop and market more successful products or services offer competitive products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering a better value proposition or if we do not continue to develop consistently highquality and wellreceived products and services our revenue margins and profitability will decline 

we maintain a relatively limited product portfolio in an effort to focus on developing highquality products with the potential to become “hits” highquality titles even if highlyreviewed may not turn into “hit” products many “hit” products within our industry are iterations of prior hit products with large established consumer bases and significant brand recognition which makes competing in certain product categories challenging in addition hit products or services of our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause our products and services to underperform relative to revenue expectations publishing a relatively small number of major titles each year also concentrates risk in those titles and means each major title has greater associated risk a significant portion of our revenue has historically been derived from games and services based on a few popular franchises for example in fiscal year 2015 net revenue generated from the sale of products and services associated with our three largest franchises accounted for approximately 54 percent  of our net revenue the underperformance of a single major title may have a large adverse impact on our financial results 

our operating   results will be adversely affected   if we do not consistently meet our product development schedules or if key events or sports seasons that we tie our product release schedules to are delayed or cancelled 

our business is highly seasonal with the highest levels of consumer demand and a significant percentage of our sales occurring in the quarter ending in december and a seasonal low in sales volume in the quarter ending in june while our sales generally follow this seasonal trend there can be no assurance that this trend will continue if we miss key selling periods for products for any reason including product delays product cancellations or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have developed products our sales are likely to suffer significantly additionally macroeconomic conditions or the occurrence of unforeseen events that negatively impact retailer or consumer buying patterns during the quarter ending in december are likely to affect us disproportionately our ability to meet product development schedules is affected by a number of factors both within and outside our control including feedback from our players the creative processes involved the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams the increasing complexity of our products and the platforms for which they are developed and the need to finetune our products prior to their release we have experienced development delays for our products in the past which caused us to delay or cancel release dates we also seek to release certain products in conjunction with key events such as the beginning of a sports season or major sporting event or the release of a related movie if a key event or sports season to which our product release schedule is tied were to be delayed or cancelled our sales would likely suffer disproportionately any failure to meet anticipated production or release schedules would likely result in a delay of revenue andor possibly a significant shortfall in our revenue increase our development andor marketing expenses harm our profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different than anticipated 

the console segment of the entertainment software industry is cyclical driven by the periodic introduction of new console systems during the transition period to new console systems our operating results may be more volatile 

new video game console systems have historically been developed and released every few years which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well in periods of transition from legacy generation consoles to new generation consoles sales of software for legacy generation console systems typically slow or decline in response to the anticipated and actual introduction of new consoles and new generation console software sales typically stabilize after new consoles are widelyestablished with the consumer base 

sony and microsoft launched the playstation 4 and xbox one respectively in november 2013 during fiscal 2015 we saw consumers purchase fewer software products for the sony playstation 3 and microsoft xbox 360 legacy generation consoles consistent with other transition periods we expect this trend to continue this trend could also accelerate faster than anticipated and may put downward pressure on legacy generation video game software pricing which could negatively affect our operating results our revenue from software sales for the playstation 4 and xbox one may not offset the negative effects of this trend on our operating results in addition we do not control the unit volumes of consoles made available for sale or the rates at which consumers purchase these consoles as a result our operating results during this transitional period may be more volatile and difficult to predict 

our business is dependent on the success and availability of video game hardware systems and devices manufactured by third parties as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for these systems and devices 

the success of our business is driven in part by the commercial success and adequate supply of video game console systems pcs mobile phones and tablets manufactured by third parties our success also depends on our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be successful in the marketplace and our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for these platforms we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of anticipated platform release dates and may incur significant expense to adjust our product portfolio and development efforts in response to changing consumer platform preferences additionally we may enter into certain exclusive licensing arrangements that affect our ability to deliver or market products or services on certain platforms a platform for which we are developing products and services may not succeed to the extent expected or new platforms may take market share and game software consumers away from platforms for which we have devoted significant resources if consumer demand for the platforms for which we are developing products and services is lower than our expectations we may be unable to fully recover the investments we have made in developing our products and services and our financial performance will be harmed alternatively a platform for which we have not devoted significant resources could be more successful than we had initially anticipated causing us to not be able to take advantage of meaningful revenue opportunities 

our adoption of new business models could fail to produce our desired financial returns 

we are actively seeking to monetize game properties through a variety of new business models including from digital content delivery such as online distribution of full games and additional content freetodownload games supported by advertising andor microtransactions and subscription services forecasting our revenues and profitability for these new business models is inherently uncertain and volatile our actual revenue and profit for these businesses may be significantly greater or less than our forecasts additionally these new business models could fail for one or more of our titles resulting in the loss of our investment in the development and infrastructure needed to support these new business models as well as the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from more successful businesses 

technology changes rapidly in our business and if we fail to anticipate or   successfully develop games for new platforms and services adopt new distribution technologies or methods or implement new technologies in our games the quality timeliness and   competitiveness of our products and services will suffer 

rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate sometimes years in advance which technologies we must implement and take advantage of in order to make our products and services competitive in the market we have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies technologies products and services such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the technology we choose to adopt and the platforms products and services that we pursue will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

our product development usually starts with particular platforms and distribution methods in mind and a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve we may not be able to achieve these goals or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly and effectively than we can in either case our products and services may be technologically inferior to our competitors’ less appealing to consumers or both if we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule for our products and services then we may delay their release until these technology goals can be achieved which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses alternatively we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies either to preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up with our competition which would increase our development expenses we may also miss opportunities to adopt technology or develop products and services for new platforms or services that become popular with consumers which could adversely affect our revenues it may take significant time and resources to shift our focus to such technologies or platforms putting us at a competitive disadvantage 

if we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to include intellectual property owned by others in our games or to maintain or acquire the rights to publish or distribute games developed by others our business may be harmed 

many of our products and services are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our ea sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players’ associations we also publish and distribute products developed and owned by thirdparties under license agreements with these parties competition for these licenses and rights is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses and rights or obtain additional licenses or rights with significant commercial value our revenue profitability and cash flows may decline significantly competition for these licenses may also increase the amounts that we must pay to licensors and developers through higher minimum guarantees or royalty rates which could significantly increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

security breaches and cyber threats could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

as our digital business grows we continue to face cyber risks and threats that seek to damage disrupt or gain access to our networks our products and services and supporting infrastructure our business partners including our channel partners also are subject to these risks such cyber risks and threats may be difficult to detect any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or cyber risk could result in interruptions to the services we provide degrade the user experience cause our users to lose confidence in our products as well as significant legal and financial exposure this could harm our business and reputation disrupt our relationships with partners and diminish our competitive position 

successful exploitation of our systems can have other negative effects upon the products services and user experience we offer in particular the virtual economies that we have established in many of our games are subject to abuse exploitation and other forms of fraudulent activity that can negatively impact our business virtual economies involve the use of virtual currency andor virtual assets that can be redeemed by a player within a particular game or game service the abuse or exploitation of our virtual economies include the illegitimate generation and sale of virtual items in black markets our online services have been impacted by ingame exploits and the use of automated processes to generate virtual currency illegitimately in the past which were traded in black markets these kinds of activities and the steps that we take to address these issues may result in a loss of anticipated revenue interfere with players’ enjoyment of a balanced game environment and cause reputational harm 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services that may harm our business 

we are investing and expect to continue to invest in technology hardware and software to support our portfolio of online products and services launching and operating online games and services developing related technologies and implementing online business initiatives is expensive and complex execution of these initiatives could result in operational failures and other issues impacting the technical stability of our products and services in addition having the necessary infrastructure to support our online products and services is vital to our growth and success our products and services could be adversely impacted by outages disruptions and failures in our network and related infrastructure as well as in the online platforms of key business partners who offer or support our online products and services 

our business could be adversely affected if our consumer protection data privacy and security practices are not adequate or perceived as being inadequate to prevent data breaches or by the application of consumer protection and data privacy and security laws generally 

in the course of our business we collect process store and use consumer information including personal information passwords and credit card information although we take measures to protect consumer information from unauthorized access acquisition disclosure and misuse our security controls policies and practices may not be able to prevent the improper or unauthorized access acquisition or disclosure of such consumer information in addition third party vendors and business partners which in the course of our business receive access to consumer information that we collect also may not prevent data security breaches with respect to the consumer information we provide them or fully enforce our policies contractual obligations and disclosures regarding the collection use storage transfer and retention of personal data the unauthorized access acquisition or disclosure of consumer information could significantly harm our reputation compel us to comply with disparate breach notification laws and otherwise subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others and substantial legal liability a perception that we do not adequately secure consumer information could result in a loss of current or potential consumers and business partners as well as a loss of anticipated revenues our key business partners also face these same risks with respect to consumer information they collect and data security breaches with respect to such information could cause reputational harm to them and negatively impact our ability to offer our products and services through their platforms 

we are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations pursuant to contracts with payment card processors under these rules and obligations if information is compromised we could be liable to payment card issuers for the cost of associated expenses and penalties in addition if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards even if no customer information is compromised we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs 

  

in addition the rate of data privacy security and consumerprotection lawmaking is accelerating globally and the interpretation and application of consumer protection and data privacy and security laws in the united states europe and elsewhere are often uncertain contradictory and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted or applied in a manner that is adverse to us or otherwise inconsistent with our practices which could result in litigation regulatory investigations and potential legal liability or require us to change our practices in a manner adverse to our business as a result our reputation may be harmed we could incur substantial costs and we could lose both customers and revenue 

any failure by ea or our agents to comply with our privacy policy or with other federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against ea by governmental entities or others as well as resulting liability 

negative player perceptions about our brands products services andor business practices may damage our business and the costs incurred in addressing player concerns may increase our operating expenses 

individual players form our ultimate customer base and player expectations regarding the quality performance and integrity of our products and services are high players may be critical of our brands products services andor business practices for a wide variety of reasons these negative player reactions may not be foreseeable or within our control to manage effectively including perceptions about gameplay fairness negative player reactions to game content components and services or objections to certain of our business practices in the past we have taken actions including delaying the release of our games after taking into consideration among other things feedback from the player community even if those decisions negatively impacted our operating results in the short term we expect to continue to take actions to address concerns as appropriate including actions that may result in additional expenditures and the loss of revenue negative player sentiment about our business practices also can lead to investigations from regulatory agencies and consumer groups as well as litigation which regardless of their outcome may be costly damaging to our reputation and harm our business 

if we release defective products or services our operating results could suffer 

products and services such as ours are extremely complex software programs and are difficult to develop and distribute we have quality controls in place to detect defects in our products and services before they are released nonetheless these quality controls are subject to human error overriding and reasonable resource constraints therefore these quality controls and preventative measures may not be effective in detecting defects in our products and services before they have been released into the marketplace in such an event we could be required to or may find it necessary to voluntarily recall a product or suspend the availability of the product or service which could significantly harm our business and operating results 

our business is subject to increasing regulation and the adoption of proposed legislation we oppose could negatively impact our business 

legislation is continually being introduced in the united states and other countries to mandate rating requirements or set other restrictions on the advertisement or distribution of entertainment software based on content in the united states most courts including the united states supreme court that have ruled on such legislation have generally ruled in a manner favorable to the interactive entertainment industry some foreign countries have adopted ratings regulations and certain countries allow government censorship of entertainment software products adoption of government ratings system or restrictions on distribution of entertainment software based on content could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers and compliance with new and possibly inconsistent regulations for different territories could be costly delay or prevent the release of our products in those territories 

as we increase the online delivery of our products and services we are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet in addition laws and regulations relating to user privacy data collection retention electronic commerce consumer protection content advertising localization and information security have been adopted or are being considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation furthermore any failure on our part to comply with these laws or the application of these laws in an unanticipated manner may harm our business and result in penalties or significant legal liability 

if we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel we will be unable to   effectively conduct our business 

the market for technical creative marketing and other personnel essential to the development and marketing of our products and services and management of our businesses is extremely competitive our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting our executives as well as key creative and technical talent if we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need or replace key employees following their departure our ability to develop and manage our business will be impaired 

if our marketing and advertising efforts fail to resonate with our customers our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our products and services are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs such as online and mobile advertising television advertising retail merchandising website development event sponsorship and direct communications with our consumers including via email our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part upon the success of these programs if the marketing for our products and services fails to resonate with our customers particularly during the critical holiday season or during other key selling periods or as advertising rates or other media placement costs increase these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

a significant portion of our sales are made to a relatively small number of key   customers if these customers reduce their purchases of our products and services or become   unable to pay for them our business could be harmed 

during the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 approximately 58 percent of our net revenue was derived from our top ten customers though our products are available to consumers through a variety of retailers and directly through us the concentration of our sales in one or a few large customers could lead to a shortterm disruption in our sales if one or more of these customers significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to carry our products and services and could make us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers became unable to pay for our products or declared bankruptcy additionally our receivables from these large customers generally increase significantly in the december quarter as they make purchases in anticipation of the holiday selling season having such a large portion of our total net revenue concentrated in a few customers could reduce our negotiating leverage with these customers if one or more of our key customers experience deterioration in their business or become unable to obtain sufficient financing to maintain their operations our business could be harmed 

our channel partners have significant influence over the products and services that we offer on their platforms 

  

our products and services are sold to customers primarily through retailers and online through our channel partners including sony microsoft apple and google in many cases our channel partners set the rates that we must pay to provide our games and services through their online channels in certain cases our channel partners retain flexibility to change their fee structures or adopt different fee structures for their online channels which could adversely impact our costs profitability and margins 

outside of the financial arrangements our agreements with our channel partners typically give them significant control over other aspects of the distribution of the products and services that we develop for their platform for example our agreements with sony and microsoft typically give significant control to them over the approval manufacturing and distribution of our products and services which could in certain circumstances leave us unable to get our products and services approved manufactured and distributed to customers for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 66 percent of our net revenue was derived from products and services for sony’s playstation 3 and 4 and microsoft’s xbox 360 and one consoles combined across all four platforms for our digital products and services delivered direct to consumers via digital channels such as sony’s playstation network microsoft’s xbox live marketplace apple’s app store and the google play store the channel partner has policies and guidelines that control the promotion and distribution of these titles and the features and functionalities that we are permitted to offer through the channel 

in addition while we have negotiated agreements in place with our channel partners  these agreements reserve the right by our channel partners to determine and change unilaterally certain key terms and conditions including the ability to change their user and developer policies and guidelines which can negatively impact our business if our channel partners establish terms that restrict our offerings through their channels or significantly impact the financial terms on which these products or services are offered to our customers our business could be harmed 

our business is subject to risks generally associated with the entertainment industry any of which could significantly harm our operating results 

our business is subject to risks that are generally associated with the entertainment industry many of which are beyond our control these risks could negatively impact our operating results and include the popularity price and timing of our games and the platforms on which they are played economic conditions that adversely affect discretionary consumer spending changes in consumer demographics the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted 

we rely on business partners in many areas of our business and our business may be harmed if they are unable to honor their obligations to us or their actions may put us at risk 

we rely on various business partners including thirdparty service providers vendors licensing partners development partners and licensees among others in many areas of our business the actions of our business partners may put our business and our reputation at risk in many cases these third parties are given access to sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support to our teams these third parties may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it the failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies or the failure of the third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies could result in a disruption to our business operations further disruptions in the financial markets and economic downturns may adversely affect our business partners and they may not be able to continue honoring their obligations to us alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner or vendor if we lose one or more significant business partners our business could be harmed 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights which could harm our business   

from time to time third parties may assert claims against us based on allegations of violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained although we take steps to avoid knowingly violating the intellectual property rights of others it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement in addition our products often utilize complex cuttingedge technology that may be subject to intellectual property claims particularly since there are an increasing number of companies that focus their efforts exclusively on enforcing their patent rights 

existing or future infringement claims against us whether valid or not may be time consuming and expensive to defend such claims or litigations could require us to pay damages and other costs stop selling the affected products redesign those products to avoid infringement or obtain a license all of which could be costly and harm our business in addition many patents have been issued that may apply to potential new modes of delivering playing or monetizing game software products and services such as those that we produce or would like to offer in the future we may discover that future opportunities to provide new and innovative modes of game play and game delivery to consumers may be precluded by existing patents that we are unable to license on reasonable terms 

from time to time we may become involved in other legal proceedings which could   adversely affect us 

we are currently and from time to time in the future may become subject to legal proceedings claims litigation and government investigations or inquiries which could be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations in addition the outcome of any legal proceedings claims litigation investigations or inquiries may be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

acquisitions investments and other strategic transactions could result in   operating difficulties dilution to our investors and other negative   consequences 

we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into other strategic transactions including 1 acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets 2 minority investments in strategic partners and 3 investments in new interactive entertainment businesses eg online and mobile publishing platforms as part of our longterm business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including in the end that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment that we acquire unknown liabilities or that we experience difficulty in the integration of business systems and technologies the integration and retention of new employees or in the maintenance of key business and customer relationships of the businesses we acquire or diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses these events could harm our operating results or financial condition 

future acquisitions and investments also could involve the issuance of our equity and equitylinked securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses such as stockbased compensation any of the foregoing factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating performance that could have otherwise been achieved by us on a standalone basis our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

our products and brands are subject to the threat of piracy unauthorized copying and other forms of intellectual property infringement 

we regard our products and brands as proprietary and take measures to protect our products brands and other confidential information from infringement we are aware that some unauthorized copying of our products and brands occurs and if a significantly greater amount were to occur it could negatively impact our business 

piracy and other forms of unauthorized copying and use of our content and brands are persistent problems for us and policing is difficult further the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be distributed either do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states or are poorly enforced legal protection of our rights may be ineffective in such countries in addition although we take steps to enforce and police our rights factors such as   the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures used in our products the availability of broadband access to the internet the refusal of internet service providers or platform holders to remove infringing content in certain instances and the proliferation of online channels through which infringing product is distributed have all have contributed to an expansion in unauthorized copying of our products and brands 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our infrastructure that may harm our business 

we may be subject to outrages or disruptions of our infrastructure including information technology system failures and network disruptions these may be caused by natural disasters cyberincidents weather events power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or other events system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the company’s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could prevent access to our products services or online stores selling our products and services our corporate headquarters in redwood city ca and our studio in burnaby british columbia are located in seismically active regions and certain of our game development activities and other essential business operations are conducted at these locations an event that results in the disruption of any of our critical business or it systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations 

our business is subject to currency fluctuations 

international sales are a fundamental part of our business for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 international net revenue comprised 57 percent of our total net revenue and we expect international sales to continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue as a result of our international sales and also the denomination of our foreign investments and our cash and cash equivalents in foreign currencies we are exposed to the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the significant strengthening of the us dollar during the second half of fiscal year 2015 particularly relative to the euro british pound sterling swedish krona and canadian dollar had a negative impact on our reported international net revenue but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses because these amounts were translated at lower rates in fiscal 2015 than fiscal 2014 our fiscal year 2015 results of operations including our net revenue and net income were adversely affected by these foreign currency fluctuations and these trends may continue in fiscal 2016 we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency risk however these activities are limited in the protection they provide us from foreign currency fluctuations and can themselves result in losses 

we utilize debt financing and such indebtedness could adversely impact our business and financial condition 

we have outstanding 6325 million of convertible senior notes due july 2016 the “notes” which result in debt service obligations of approximately 5 million per year in addition in march 2015 we entered into an unsecured committed 500 million revolving credit facility while the facility is currently undrawn we may use the proceeds of any future borrowings for general corporate purposes the credit facility contains affirmative negative and financial covenants including a maximum capitalization ratio and minimum liquidity requirements we may enter into other financial instruments in the future 

our indebtedness particularly the july 2016 maturity of the notes could affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

 

in connection with the offering of the notes we entered into certain privatelynegotiated transactions to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes we also entered into separate privatelynegotiated warrant transactions whereby we sold warrants to independent third parties the effect if any of these activities including the direction or magnitude on the market price of our common stock will depend on a variety of factors including market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities could however adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes in addition the counterparties to these agreements are financial institutions and we are subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties might default on the transactions our exposure to the credit risk of these counterparties is not secured by any collateral and the amount of that exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and accruals for other taxes and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by our profit levels by changes in our business reorganization of our business and operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the elections we make changes in applicable tax laws or changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as well as other factors we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions furthermore we are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities with respect to both income and such other nonincome taxes adverse changes in our effective income tax rate unfavorable audit results or tax rulings or other changes resulting in significant additional tax liabilities could have material adverse effects upon our earnings cash flows and financial condition 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in   financial accounting standards 

our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting standards promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies for example accounting standards affecting software revenue recognition have affected and could continue to significantly affect the way we account for revenue and costs related to our products and services we recognize all of the revenue from bundled sales ie onlineenabled games that include updates on a whenandifavailable basis or a matchmaking service on a deferred basis over an estimated offering period the related costs of revenues are expensed as incurred instead of deferred and recognized ratably in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in us gaap when it becomes effective while we have not yet determined the effect of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements we believe the new standard may require us to materially change the way we account for revenue by requiring us to recognize more revenue upon delivery of the primary product than we currently do under current accounting standards the new standard may also require us to materially change the way we account for related costs by requiring us to capitalize and amortize certain costs over the period the related assets are transferred to the customer 

as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue costs and taxes could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors above as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts’ earnings estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts’ and investors’ expectations to factors affecting the entertainment computer software internet media or electronics industries to our ability to successfully integrate any acquisitions we may make or to national or international economic conditions in particular 

economic downturns may contribute to the public stock markets experiencing extreme price and trading volume volatility these broad market fluctuations have and could continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following overview is a highlevel discussion of our operating results as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers provides important context for our results for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015  as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form 10k including in the “business” section and the “risk factors” above the remainder of this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda”” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

about electronic arts

financial results 

total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015  was 4515 million  an increase of 940 million  or 26 percent  as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2014  net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015  was driven by fifa 14   fifa 15  and  battlefield 4 at march 31 2015  deferred net revenue associated with sales of onlineenabled games decreased  by 207 million  as compared to march 31 2014  directly increasing the amount of reported net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2015  at march 31 2014  deferred net revenue associated with sales of onlineenabled games increased  by 446 million  as compared to march 31 2013  directly decreasing the amount of reported net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2014  disregarding the impact of the deferred net revenue of 287 million and 11 million of unrecognized cash flow hedging net gains reported net revenue would have increased  by approximately 298 million  or 7 percent  during the fiscal year ended march 31 2015  as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2014  

net income for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015  was 875 million  as compared to 8 million  for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014  diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015  was 269  as compared to a diluted earnings per share of 003  for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014  net income increased for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015  as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2014  primarily as a result of a 940 million  increase in net revenue and a 57 million  decrease in operating expenses partially offset by an 82 million  increase in cost of revenue and a 51 million  increase in income tax expenses 

international operations and foreign currency exchange impact international net revenue was 2559 million  or 57 percent  of total net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2015  compared to 2065 million  or 58 percent  of total net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2014  an increase  of 494 million  or 24 percent  we estimate that the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates due to translation during the second half of fiscal year 2015  primarily the us dollar strengthening against the euro and related cash flow hedging activities decreased reported international net revenue by approximately 30 million  or 1 percent  for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015  excluding the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates from translation and related cash flow hedging activities we estimate that international net revenue would have increased by approximately 524 million  or 25 percent  for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015  as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2014  this increase is primarily due to our fifa and   plants vs zombies franchises and titanfall  partially offset by decreased revenue in our simcity crysis and dead space franchises in addition our international investments and our cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and decline in value when the us dollar strengthens against the currencies in which our international investments are denominated 

  

trends in our business 

digital transformation  our business continues to transform from a traditional packaged goods business model to one in which our games and services are sold and delivered via a network connection with digitallydelivered content features and services helping to extend the life of the respective game offering for example many of our products that traditionally have been sold only as packaged goods products can now also be purchased and downloaded via a network connection we also include digitallydelivered content features and services as part of the product offering either made available for free or at additional cost for example the ultimate team mode incorporated into recent iterations of our fifa madden nfl nhl and nba franchises and expansion packs available digitally for our battlefield and sims franchises have kept many of our players engaged with those games for longer periods of time additionally our mobile and pc freetodownload games are available solely via digital delivery and are typically monetized through a business model through which we sell incremental content andor features in discrete transactions we also provide our ea access service for the xbox one which offers players access to a selection of ea games and other benefits for a monthly or annual fee 

we significantly increased our digital net revenue from 1440 million in fiscal year 2013 to 1833 million in fiscal year 2014 and 2199 million during fiscal year 2015 we expect this portion of our business to continue to grow through fiscal year 2016 and beyond 

console system transition  we have made and will continue to make significant investments in products and services for the playstation 4 from sony and xbox one from microsoft and we also expect to continue to develop and market products and services for the microsoft xbox 360 and the sony playstation 3 industry sales of major games for these legacy consoles declined significantly during our 2015 fiscal year although the decline in sales for legacy consoles was less than we anticipated during fiscal year 2015  we think that this sales decline trend will continue the success of our products and services for the newgeneration consoles depends in part on the commercial success and adequate supply of as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for these consoles 

foreign currency exchange rates international sales are a fundamental part of our business and the significant strengthening of the us dollar during the second half of fiscal year 2015 particularly relative to the euro british pound sterling swedish krona and canadian dollar had a negative impact on our reported international net revenues but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses because these amounts were translated at lower rates in fiscal year 2015 than in fiscal year 2014 while we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risk these activities are limited in the protection that they provide us and can themselves result in losses we currently anticipate foreign currency exchange rates to have a negative impact on our expected reported net revenue in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 but the strengthening of the us dollar is expected to have a positive impact on our reported operating expenses as a significant portion of those expenses are incurred outside the united states 

mobile and pc freetodownload games  the proliferation of mobile phones and tablets has significantly increased the consumer base for mobile games the broad consumer acceptance of freetodownload business models which allow consumers to try new games with no upfront cost and pay for additional content or ingame items has led to growth in the mobile gaming industry likewise the mass introduction and wide consumer acceptance of freetodownload microtransactionbased pc games played over the internet has also broadened our consumer base we expect revenue generated from mobile and pc freetodownload games to remain an important part of our business 

we track an estimate of monthly active users “maus” for our mobile business which we believe is a useful indicator of player engagement trends for that business for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015  we had average maus of over 165 million maus are the aggregate number of individuals who accessed a particular game on a particular device in the last 30 days as of the measurement date for our calculation an individual who either plays two of our games on a single device or the same game on two devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users average maus for a particular period is the average of the maus at each monthend during that period maus are calculated using internal company data based on tracking the activity of user accounts we also include in this calculation data provided by our third party publishing partners for certain games that we develop but we exclude information from third party titles that we publish from time to time we adjust the calculation for user activity that is inconsistent with our methodology we believe that the numbers are reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement however factors relating to user activity may impact these numbers our methodology for calculating maus may differ from the methodology used by other companies to calculate this metric 

concentration of sales among the most popular games  in all major segments of our industry we see a large portion of games sales concentrated on the most popular titles and many of those titles are sequels of prior games a significant portion of our revenue has historically been derived from games and services based on a few popular franchises for example in fiscal year 2015 net revenue generated from the sale of products and services associated with our three largest franchises accounted for approximately 54 of our net revenue we expect this trend to continue in fiscal year 2016 

recent developments 

stock repurchase program in may 2015 our board of directors authorized a new program to repurchase up to 1 billion of our common stock this new stock repurchase program which expires on may 31 2017 supersedes and replaces the stock repurchase authorization approved in may 2014 under which we repurchased approximately 83 million  shares for approximately 337 million  during fiscal year 2015 under the new program we may purchase stock in the open market or through privatelynegotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws including pursuant to prearranged stock trading plans the timing and actual amount of the stock repurchases will depend on several factors including price capital availability regulatory requirements alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions we are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares under this program and it may be modified suspended or discontinued at any time we continue to actively repurchase shares 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities contingent assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown as a result actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

revenue recognition sales returns and allowances and bad debt reserves 

we derive revenue principally from sales of interactive software games and related content  eg  microtransactions and services on 1 video game consoles such as the playstation 3 and 4 from sony and the xbox 360 and xbox one from microsoft and pcs and 2 mobile phones and tablets we evaluate revenue recognition based on the criteria set forth in fasb accounting standards codification “asc” 605 revenue recognition and asc 985605 software revenue recognition  we classify our revenue as either product revenue or service and other revenue 

product revenue  our product revenue includes revenue associated with the sale of software games or related content whether delivered via a physical disc  e  g  packaged goods or delivered digitally via the internet  eg  fullgame downloads extracontent and licensing of game software to thirdparties product revenue also includes revenue from mobile fullgame downloads that do not require our hosting support  eg  premium mobile games and sales of tangible products such as hardware peripherals or collectors’ items 

service and other revenue  our service revenue includes revenue recognized from timebased subscriptions and games or related content that requires our hosting support in order to utilize the game or related content  ie  can only be played with an internet connection this includes 1 entitlements to content that are accessed through hosting services  eg  microtransactions for internetbased social network and freetodownload mobile games 2 massively multiplayer online “mmo” games both software game and subscription sales 3 subscriptions for our battlefield premium ea access and pogobranded online game services and 4 allocated service revenue from sales of software games with an online service element  ie “matchmaking” service our other revenue includes advertising and nonsoftware licensing revenue 

with respect to the allocated service revenue from sales of software games with a matchmaking service mentioned above our allocation of proceeds between product and service revenue for presentation purposes is based on management’s best estimate of the selling price of the matchmaking service with the residual value allocated to product revenue our estimate of the selling price of the matchmaking service is comprised of several factors including but not limited to prior selling prices for the matchmaking service prices charged separately by other thirdparty vendors for similar service offerings and a costplusmargin approach we review the estimated selling price of the online matchmaking service on a regular basis and use this methodology consistently to allocate revenue between product and service for software game sales with a matchmaking service 

we evaluate and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met 

 

 

 

 

onlineenabled games 

the majority of our software games and related content can be connected to the internet whereby a consumer may be able to download unspecified content or updates on a whenandifavailable basis “unspecified updates” for use with the original game software in addition we may also offer an online matchmaking service that permits consumers to play against each other via the internet without a separate fee us gaap requires us to account for the consumer’s right to receive unspecified updates or the matchmaking service for no additional fee as a “bundled” sale or multipleelement arrangement 

we have an established historical pattern of providing unspecified updates  eg  player roster updates to madden nfl 15  to onlineenabled games and related content at no additional charge to the consumer we do not have vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” for these unspecified updates and thus as required by us gaap we recognize revenue from the sale of these onlineenabled games and related content over the period we expect to offer the unspecified updates to the consumer “estimated offering period” 

estimated offering period 

because the offering period is not an explicitly defined period we must make an estimate of the offering period determining the estimated offering period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage for example in determining the estimated offering period for unspecified updates associated with our onlineenabled games we consider the period of time consumers are online as online connectivity is required on an annual basis we review consumers’ online gameplay of all onlineenabled games that have been released 12 to 24 months prior to the evaluation date for example if our evaluation date is april 1 2014 we evaluate all onlineenabled games released between april 1 2012 and march 31 2013 based on this population of games for all players that register the game online within the first six months of release of the game to the general public we compute the weightedaverage number of days for each onlineenabled game based on when a player initially registers the game online to when that player last plays the game online we then compute the weightedaverage number of days for all onlineenabled games by multiplying the weightedaverage number of days for each onlineenabled game by its relative percentage of total units sold from these onlineenabled games  ie  a game with more units sold will have a higher weighting to the overall computation than a game with fewer units sold under a similar computation we also consider the estimated period of time between the date a game unit is sold to a reseller and the date the reseller sells the game unit to an end consumer  ie  time in channel based on these two calculations we then consider the method of distribution for example   physical software games sold at retail would have a composite offering period equal to the online gameplay plus time in channel as opposed to digitally distributed software games which are delivered immediately via digital download and thus have no concept of channel additionally we consider results from prior analyses known online gameplay trends as well as disclosed service periods for competitors’ games in determining the estimated offering period for future sales 

while we consistently apply this methodology inherent assumptions used in this methodology include which onlineenabled games to sample whether to use only units that have registered online whether to weight the number of days for each game whether to weight the days based on the units sold of each game determining the period of time between the date of sale to reseller and the date of sale to the consumer and assessing online gameplay trends 

prior to july 1 2013 for most sales we estimated the offering period to be six months and recognized revenue over this period in the month after delivery during the three months ended september 30 2013 we completed our fiscal 2014 annual evaluation of the estimated offering period and noted that generally consumers were playing our games online over a longer period of time based on this we concluded that for physical software sales made after june 30 2013 the estimated offering period should be increased to nine months resulting in revenue being recognized over a longer period of time this change in estimate resulted in an estimated decrease to net revenue and net income of 474 million  and a decrease of 150  of diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2014 during the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 this change in estimate resulted in an estimated increase to net revenue and net income of 474 million  and an increase of 146  of diluted earnings per share the estimated offering period for digitally distributed games did not change and is six months we completed our fiscal 2015 annual evaluation during the second quarter and determined that the estimated offering period for physical software sales and digital sales continues to be nine months and six months respectively 

other multipleelement arrangements 

in some of our multipleelement arrangements we sell tangible products with software andor softwarerelated offerings these tangible products are generally either peripherals or ancillary collectors’ items such as figurines and comic books revenue for these arrangements is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each deliverable using the relative selling prices of each deliverable in the arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy described below if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable the arrangement consideration is allocated to the software deliverables as a group and then allocated to each software deliverable in accordance with asc 985605 

we determine the selling price for a tangible product deliverable based on the following selling price hierarchy vsoe  ie  the price we charge when the tangible product is sold separately if available thirdparty evidence “tpe” of fair value  ie  the price charged by others for similar tangible products if vsoe is not available or our best estimate of selling price “besp” if neither vsoe nor tpe is available determining the besp is a subjective process that is based on multiple factors including but not limited to recent selling prices and related discounts market conditions customer classes sales channels and other factors in accordance with asc 605 provided the other three revenue recognition criteria other than delivery have been met we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer as we have no further obligations 

we must make assumptions and judgments in order to 1 determine whether and when each element is delivered 2 determine whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element and 3 allocate the total price among the various elements as applicable changes to any of these assumptions and judgments or changes to the elements in the arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

principal agent considerations 

in accordance with asc 60545  revenue recognition principal agent considerations  we evaluate sales of our interactive software games via third party storefronts including digital storefronts such as xbox live marketplace sony psn apple app store and google play in order to determine whether or not we are acting as the principal or as an agent which we consider in determining if revenue should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the storefront key indicators that we evaluate in determining gross versus net treatment include but are not limited to the following 

 based on the evaluation of the above indicators we have determined that we are generally acting as an agent and are not considered the primary obligor to consumers for our interactive software games distributed through third party digital storefronts we therefore recognize revenue related to these arrangements on a net basis 

sales returns and allowances and bad debt reserves 

we reduce revenue primarily for estimated future returns and price protection which may occur with our distributors and retailers “channel partners” price protection represents our practice to provide our channel partners with a credit allowance to lower their wholesale price on a particular product in the channel the amount of the price protection is generally the difference between the old wholesale price and the new reduced wholesale price in certain countries for our pc and console packaged goods software products we also have a practice of allowing channel partners to return older software products in the channel in exchange for a credit allowance as a general practice we do not give cash refunds 

when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances we analyze the following historical credit allowances current sellthrough of our channel partners’ inventory of our software products current trends in retail and the video game industry changes in customer demand acceptance of our software products and other related factors in addition we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection in subsequent periods 

in the future actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold software products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms product updates or competing software products while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters these estimates are inherently subjective accordingly if our estimates change our returns and price protection allowances would change and would impact the total net revenue accounts receivable and deferred net revenue that we report 

we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating the following customer creditworthiness current economic trends historical experience age of current accounts receivable balances and changes in financial condition or payment terms of our customers significant management judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly as a result of a change in any of the evaluation factors mentioned above 

fair value estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item in order to fairly present our financial statements without an independent market or another representative transaction determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the accounting 

there are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value these include 1 the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value 2 the income approach which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example future cash flows or future earnings to a single present value amount and 3 the cost approach which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset for many of our fair value estimates including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets we use the income approach using the income approach requires the use of financial models which require us to make various estimates including but not limited to 1 the potential future cash flows for the asset or liability being measured 2 the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows 3 the time value of money associated with the expected receipt or payment of such cash flows and 4 the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium making these cash flow estimates is inherently difficult and subjective and if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate our financial results may be negatively impacted furthermore relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact to the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached for example a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired 

while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions the following areas are the most sensitive to these assessments 

business combinations    we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities and contingencies assumed acquired inprocess technology and contingent consideration issued in a business combination our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various estimated useful lives furthermore the estimated fair value assigned to an acquired asset or liability has a direct impact on the amount we recognize as goodwill which is an asset that is not amortized determining the fair value of assets acquired requires an assessment of the highest and best use or the expected price to sell the asset and the related expected future cash flows determining the fair value of acquired inprocess technology also requires an assessment of our expectations related to the use of that technology determining the fair value of an assumed liability requires an assessment of the expected cost to transfer the liability determining the fair value of contingent consideration requires an assessment of the probabilityweighted expected future cash flows over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled and applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration payable are forecasted earnings significant changes in forecasted earnings would result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurement this fair value assessment is also required in periods subsequent to a business combination such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

assessment of impairment of goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets   current accounting standards require that we assess the recoverability of our finite lived acquisitionrelated intangible assets and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets is potentially impaired in order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred management must make various assumptions about the estimated fair value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated future cash flows for some assets our estimated fair value is dependent upon predicting which of our products will be successful this success is dependent upon several factors such as which operating platforms will be successful in the marketplace also our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules judgments and assumptions about future cash flows and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to significant negative industry or economic trends significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the strategy of our overall business and significant underperformance relative to projected future operating results when we consider such assets to be impaired the amount of impairment we recognize is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

in assessing impairment on our goodwill we first analyze qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the qualitative factors we assess include longterm prospects of our performance share price trends and market capitalization and company specific events if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount we do not need to perform the twostep impairment test if based on that assessment we believe it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value a twostep goodwill impairment test will be performed the first step measures for impairment by applying fair valuebased tests at the reporting unit level the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit reporting units are determined by the components of operating segments that constitute a business for which 1 discrete financial information is available 2 segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component and 3 whether the component has dissimilar economic characteristics to other components 

as of our last annual assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount and as such we did not need to perform the twostep impairment test we have not identified any indicators of impairment since that assessment 

our business consists of developing marketing and distributing video game software content and services using both established and emerging intellectual properties and our forecasts for emerging intellectual properties are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information and have an inherently higher risk of inaccuracy if future forecasts are revised they may indicate or require future impairment charges we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

royalties and licenses 

our royalty expenses consist of payments to 1 content licensors 2 independent software developers and 3 copublishing and distribution affiliates license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities professional sports organizations movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks copyrights personal publicity rights content andor other intellectual property royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games copublishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of products 

royaltybased obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid these royaltybased obligations are generally expensed to cost of revenue generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on the total projected net revenue for contracts with guaranteed minimums significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors including 1 the total number of titles subject to the contract 2 the timing of the release of these titles 3 the number of software units and amount of extra content that we expect to sell which can be impacted by a number of variables including product quality number of platforms we release on the timing of the title’s release and competition and 4 future pricing determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products furthermore if we 

conclude that we are unable to make a reasonably reliable forecast of projected net revenue we recognize royalty expense at the greater of contract rate or on a straightline basis over the term of the contract accordingly if our future revenue projections change our effective royalty rates would change which could impact the amount and timing of royalty expense we recognize 

prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and copublishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product and therefore we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product accordingly payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred payments due after completion of the product primarily royaltybased in nature are generally expensed as cost of revenue 

our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor when performance remains with the licensor we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract royalty liabilities are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next 12 months 

each quarter we also evaluate the expected future realization of our royaltybased assets as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product and service sales any impairments or losses determined before the launch of a product are generally charged to research and development expense impairments or losses determined postlaunch are charged to cost of revenue we evaluate longlived royaltybased assets for impairment using undiscounted cash flows when impairment indicators exist if impairment exists then the assets are written down to fair value unrecognized minimum royaltybased commitments are accounted for as executory contracts and therefore any losses on these commitments are recognized when the underlying intellectual property is abandoned  ie  cease use or the contractual rights to use the intellectual property are terminated 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carryforwards we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified it is generally difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is significant negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years forecasts of future taxable income are considered to be less objective than past results therefore cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 

in addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities the carry back of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law and the implementation of tax planning strategies evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence this evaluation involves assumptions about future activity certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets 

in fiscal year 2015  we reported us pretax income compared to pretax losses in each of the last seven fiscal years we have not yet been able to establish a sustained level of profitability in the us or other sufficient significant positive evidence to conclude that our us deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized therefore we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets it is reasonably possible that in fiscal year 2016 we will establish a sustained level of profitability in the us as a result it is possible that a significant portion of the 539 million valuation allowance recorded against our us deferred tax assets at march 31 2015  could be reversed by the end of fiscal year 2016 

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate these estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation as well as with respect to other matters such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities the ultimate 

resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations in addition changes in our business including acquisitions changes in our international corporate structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix and amount of income as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities valuation allowances applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate 

impact of recently issued accounting standards 

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201503  interest  imputation of interest  topic 83530 which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by this asu the disclosure requirements will be effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after december 15 2015 and will require retrospective application early adoption is permitted we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers the asu will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in us gaap when it becomes effective the standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method the company is evaluating the effect that asu 201409 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures the company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting the new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 early application is not permitted we are required to adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 however in april 2015 the fasb issued an exposure draft that would provide us with the option to adopt in either the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 or fiscal year 2019 we have not determined which of these two fiscal years we would adopt if the exposure draft is issued as final in its current form 

results of operations 

our fiscal year is reported on a 52 or 53week period that ends on the saturday nearest march 31 our results of operations for the fiscal years ended march 31 2015 2014 and 2013  each contained 52 weeks and ended on march 28 2015 march 29 2014 and march 30 2013  respectively for simplicity of disclosure all fiscal periods are referred to as ending on a calendar monthend 

net revenue 

net revenue consists of sales generated from 1 video games sold as packaged goods or as digital downloads and designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation 3 and 4 from sony and the xbox 360 and one from microsoft and pcs 2 video games for mobile phones and tablets 3 separate software products and content and online game services associated with these products 4 licensing our game software to third parties 5 allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products and 6 advertisements on our online web pages and in our games 

we provide two different measures of our net revenue one of these measures is presented in accordance with us gaap  net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue the second measure is a nongaap financial measure  net revenue before revenue deferral by revenue composition which is primarily based on method of distribution we use this second nongaap financial measure internally to evaluate our operating performance when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods and when assessing the performance of our management team 

management places a greater emphasis and focus on assessing our business through a review of the net revenue before revenue deferral by revenue composition than by net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue these two measures differ as 1 net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue reflects the deferral and recognition of revenue in periods subsequent to the date of sale due to us gaap while net revenue before revenue deferral by revenue composition does not and 2 both measures contain a different aggregation of sales from one another for instance service and other revenue does not include a portion of our fullgame digital download and mobile sales that are fully included in our digital revenue further service and other revenue includes all of our revenue associated with mmo games while software sales associated with our mmos are included in either digital revenue or packaged goods and other revenue depending on whether the sale was a fullgame digital download or a packaged goods sale 

comparison of fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2014 

net revenue 

for fiscal year 2015  net revenue was 4515 million  and increased   940 million  or 26 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2014  this increase was driven by a 1481 million increase in revenue primarily from the fifa and madden nfl franchises and titanfall this increase was partially offset by a 541 million decrease in revenue primarily from the simcity crysis dead space and ncaa football franchises and star wars the old republic 

net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue 

our net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue for fiscal years 2015 and 2014  was as follows in millions 



product revenue 

for fiscal year 2015  product revenue was 2568 million  primarily driven by  fifa 15  fifa 14  and battlefield 4  product revenue increased   434 million  or 20 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2014  this increase was driven by an 837 million increase primarily from the fifa madden nfl and dragon age franchises this increase was partially offset by a 403 million decrease primarily from the crysis dead space ncaa football tiger woods pga tour and army of two franchises 

service and other revenue 

for fiscal year 2015  service and other revenue was 1947 million  primarily driven by fifa ultimate team titanfall and  battlefield 4 premium  service and other revenue for fiscal year 2015   increased   506 million  or 35 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2014  this increase was driven by a 660 million increase primarily from titanfall and the fifa and plants vs zombies franchises this increase was partially offset by a 154 million decrease primarily from simcity franchise star wars the old republic  and pogobranded online games services      

supplemental nongaap net revenue by revenue composition 

as we continue to evolve our business and more of our products are delivered to consumers digitally via the internet we place a greater emphasis and focus on assessing our business through a review of net revenue by revenue composition 

net revenue before revenue deferral a nongaap financial measure that excludes the impact of revenue deferral and the recognition of revenue deferral on net revenue related to sales of onlineenabled games and content is provided in this section of mda including a discussion of the components of this measure 1 packaged goods and other and 2 the components that comprise our digital revenue a reconciliation to the corresponding measure calculated in accordance with us gaap is provided in the discussion below 

“revenue deferral” in this “net revenue” section generally relates to sales of onlineenabled games and content for which we do not have vsoe for unspecified updates to be delivered after the initial sale or for which we have a continuing service obligation fluctuations in the revenue deferral are largely dependent upon the amounts of products that we sell with the online features and services previously discussed while the recognition of revenue deferral for a period is also dependent upon 1 the amount deferred 2 the period of time the softwarerelated offerings and service obligations are to be provided and 3 the timing of the sale 

our sales are generally deferred and recognized over an estimated ninemonth period beginning in the month after shipment for physical games sold through retail and an estimated sixmonth period for digitally delivered games and content and therefore the related revenue recognized during the fiscal quarter ended march 31 is primarily due to sales that occurred during the preceding sixmonth period for digitally delivered games and content and the preceding ninemonth period for physical games sold through retail consequently most revenue deferrals incurred in the first quarter of a fiscal year are recognized within the same fiscal year however substantially all of the revenue deferrals incurred in the last month of a fiscal year will be recognized in the subsequent fiscal year 

we believe that excluding the impact of revenue deferral and the recognition of revenue deferral related to onlineenabled games and content from our operating results is important to facilitate comparisons between periods in understanding our underlying sales performance for the period and understanding our operations because all related costs of revenues are expensed as incurred instead of deferred and recognized ratably we use this nongaap financial measure internally to evaluate our operating performance when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods and when assessing the performance of our management team while we believe that this nongaap financial measure is useful in evaluating our business this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap in addition this nongaap financial measure may not be the same as nongaap financial measures presented by other companies 

our nongaap net revenue by revenue composition and the reconciliation to net revenue for fiscal years 2015 and 2014  was as follows in millions 



net revenue before revenue deferral 

packaged goods and other 

packaged goods revenue includes sales of software that is distributed physically this includes 1 sales of our internallydeveloped and copublished game software distributed physically through traditional channels such as brick and mortar retailers 2 our software licensing revenue from third parties for example makers of personal computers or computer accessories who include certain of our products for sale with their products “oem bundles” and 3 sales through our switzerland distribution business other revenue includes our nonsoftware licensing revenue 

for fiscal year 2015  packaged goods and other net revenue before revenue deferral was 2089 million  primarily driven by fifa 15  madden nfl 15  and dragon age inquisition  packaged goods and other net revenue before revenue deferral for fiscal year 2015   decreased   139 million  or 6 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2014  this decrease was driven by a 650 million decrease in sales primarily from the battlefield need for speed and ncaa football franchises   this decrease was partially offset by a 511 million increase in sales primarily from the dragon age fifa and fifa world cup franchises  

digital 

digital revenue includes sales of software distributed through direct download via the internet this includes fullgame downloads extra content subscriptions advertising and other and mobile revenue digital revenue includes internallydeveloped and copublished game software distributed through our directtoconsumer platform origin distributed wirelessly through mobile carriers or licensed to our thirdparty publishing partners who distribute our games digitally fullgame downloads are generally classified as product revenue with the exception of our mmo and fullgame downloads related to games that require our hosting support in order to utilize the game or related content eg titanfall  and plants vs zombies garden warfare  which are classified as service revenue subscriptions advertising and other revenue and freetodownload mobile games are each generally classified as service and other revenue 

for fiscal year 2015  digital net revenue before revenue deferral was 2230 million  an increase of 437 million  or 24  as compared to fiscal year 2014  this increase is due to 1 a 96 million or 30 percent increase in fullgame download sales primarily driven by dragon age inquisition  fifa 15  and the sims 4 2 a 165 million or 22 percent increase in extra content and freetodownload sales primarily driven by fifa ultimate team and  madden ultimate team  3 a 104 million or 40 percent increase in subscription sales primarily driven by battlefield 4 premium  and 4 a 72 million or 16 percent increase in mobile revenue primarily driven by madden nfl mobile  simcity buildit  fifa 15 mobile  and fifa online 3 

revenue deferral 

revenue deferral for fiscal year 2015   increased   186 million  or 6 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2014  this increase was primarily due to a 298 million increase in net revenue before revenue deferral related to our packaged goods and other and digital sales during fiscal year 2015  as compared to fiscal year 2014  

recognition of revenue deferral 

the recognition of revenue deferral for fiscal year 2015   increased   828 million  or 29 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2014  this increase was primarily due to 1 the increase in our estimated offering period from six to nine months which was implemented during the second quarter of fiscal year 2014 for packaged goods sold through retail and 2 an increase in digital and packaged goods sales during the preceding six and ninemonth period the change in estimated offering period resulted in an estimated increase to net revenue and net income of 474 million  and an increase of 146  of diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015  

cost of revenue 

cost of revenue for fiscal years 2015 and 2014  was as follows in millions 



cost of product revenue

cost of product revenue decreased  by 4 million  or 04 percent  in fiscal year 2015  as compared to fiscal year 2014  cost of product revenue decreased primarily due to an increase in net revenue before revenue deferral from our digital product sales that generally have lower costs than our packaged goods and other product sales during fiscal year 2015  as compared to the fiscal year 2014  partially offset by a loss of 122 million on a previously unrecognized licensed intellectual property commitment recognized during the three months ended june 30 2014 

cost of service and other revenue 

cost of service and other revenue consists primarily of 1 royalty costs 2 data center bandwidth and server costs associated with hosting our online games and websites 3 platform processing fees from operating our websitebased games on third party platforms and 4 credit card fees associated with our service revenue 

cost of service and other revenue increased  by 86 million  or 273 percent  in fiscal year 2015  as compared to fiscal year 2014  the increase was primarily due to an increase in royaltyrelated costs due to fifa ultimate team  madden ultimate team  and titanfall  

total cost of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue 

during the fiscal year ended march 31 2015  total cost of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue decreased by 60 percent  as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2014  excluding the loss of 122 million on previously unrecognized license intellectual property recognized during three months ended june 30 2014 total cost of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue decreased 88 percent as a result of an increase in our digital products and services that generally have a lower cost than our packaged goods and other products 

research and development 

research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred by our production studios for personnelrelated costs related overhead costs contracted services depreciation and any impairment of prepaid royalties for prelaunch products research and development expenses for our online products include expenses incurred by our studios consisting of direct development and related overhead costs in connection with the development and production of our online games research and development expenses also include expenses associated with our digital platform software licenses and maintenance and management overhead

research and development expenses decreased  by 31 million  or 3 percent  in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 excluding the 20 million positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates due to translation and related cash flow hedging activities we estimate that research and development would have decreased by 11 million this 11 million decrease was primarily due to a 15 million decrease in personnelrelated costs resulting from a reduction in headcount and a 17 million decrease in contracted services as a result of higher development contracted services in fiscal year 2014 due to titanfall  battlefield 4  and ea sports   ufc  as compared to the current fiscal year these decreases were partially offset by a 21 million increase in facilityrelated costs primarily due to 6 million in operating costs for new office expansions and 5 million in certain facility closures 

marketing and sales 

marketing and sales expenses consist of personnelrelated costs related overhead costs advertising marketing and promotional expenses net of qualified advertising cost reimbursements from third parties 

marketing and sales expenses for fiscal years 2015 and 2014  were as follows in millions 

marketing and sales expenses decreased  by 33 million  or 5 percent  in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 the decrease was primarily due to 1 a 9 million decrease in personnelrelated costs 2 a 10 million decrease in facilityrelated costs and 3 a 9 million decrease in contracted services due to fewer frontline title releases during fiscal year 2015 than during fiscal year 2014 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related expenses of executive and administrative staff corporate functions such as finance legal human resources and information technology “it” related overhead costs fees for professional services such as legal and accounting and allowances for doubtful accounts 

general and administrative expenses for fiscal years 2015 and 2014  were as follows in millions 

general and administrative expenses decreased  by 24 million  or 6 percent  in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to a 30 million expense related to the settlement of a litigation matter during the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 and an 23 million decrease in costs incurred on a license both related to our college football franchise this was partially offset by an 11 million increase primarily related to other litigation matters and a 16 million increase in personnelrelated costs during the fiscal year ended march 31 2015  

acquisitionrelated contingent consideration 

acquisitionrelated contingent consideration for fiscal years 2015 and 2014  were as follows in millions 

during fiscal year 2015 acquisitionrelated contingent consideration credits decreased by 32 million  or 91 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily resulting from changes in the fair market value of the acquisitionrelated contingent consideration of our popcap acquisition during fiscal year 2014 the popcap earnout expired on december 31 2013 no payments were made under this earnout 

income taxes 

provision for benefit from income taxes for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 was as follows in millions 

our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 was a tax expense of 54 percent the fiscal year 2015  effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 350 percent primarily due to the utilization of us deferred tax assets which were subject to a valuation allowance excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation deductions allocated directly to contributed capital and nonus profits subject to a reduced or zero tax rates the provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2015 differs from the benefit from income taxes for fiscal year 2014  primarily due to benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and the resolution of examinations by taxing authorities recorded in fiscal year 2014  

our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2014  differs from the statutory rate of 350 percent as a result of the utilization of us deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance and tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and the resolution of examinations by taxing authorities 

our effective income tax rates for fiscal year 2016 and future periods will depend on a variety of factors including changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions changes in our international structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix of income changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in our annual pretax income or loss we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our pretax consolidated income or loss as a result in absolute dollar terms our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pretax income or loss than at higher levels in addition at lower levels of pretax income or loss our effective tax rate will be more volatile 

certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law have not been considered as a source of future taxable income that is available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets 

historically we have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly no us taxes have been provided thereon we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states

marketing and sales expenses decreased by 108 million or 14 percent in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 the decrease was primarily due to 1 a 54 million decrease in personnelrelated costs resulting from a decrease in headcount 2 a 29 million decrease in advertising and promotional spending on our franchises as compared to the prior year and 3 a 24 million decrease in contracted services

during fiscal year 2014 acquisitionrelated contingent consideration credits decreased by 29 million or 45 percent as compared to fiscal year 2013 primarily resulting from changes in our earnout estimates related to our popcap acquisition the popcap earnout expired on december 31 2013 no payments were made under this earnout

income taxes 

provision for benefit from income taxes for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 was as follows in millions 

our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2014 was a tax benefit of 143 the fiscal year 2014 effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 350 percent as a result of the utilization of us deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance and tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and the resolution of examinations by taxing authorities 

our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2013 differs from the statutory rate of 350 percent primarily due to the us losses for which no benefit is recognized and nondeductible stockbased compensation offset by nonus profits subject to reduced or zero tax rates and the nontaxable change in the estimated fair value of acquisitionrelated contingent consideration 

certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law have not been considered as a source of future taxable income that is available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets 

the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the “act” was signed into law on january 2 2013 the act contains a number of provisions including most notably an extension of the research tax credit through december 31 2013 the act did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 due to the effect of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 

historically we have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly no us taxes have been provided thereon in connection with a review of our cash position including potential future cash needs for stock repurchases and debt retirement we made a onetime repatriation of 700 million from certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries during the three months ended march 31 2014 this repatriation did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 due to the deferred tax valuation allowance 

liquidity and capital resources   



changes in cash flow 

operating activities  cash provided by operating activities increased 355 million  during fiscal year 2015  as compared to fiscal year 2014  the change is primarily due to a 298 million  increase in net revenue before revenue deferral and an 88 million decrease in research and development marketing and sales and general and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended march 31 2015  as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2014  

investing activities  cash used in investing activities increased 169 million  during fiscal year 2015  as compared to fiscal year 2014  primarily driven by a 502 million increase in purchases of shortterm investments this was partially offset by a 326 million increase in proceeds from the sales and maturities of shortterm investments during the fiscal year ended march 31 2015  as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2014  

financing activities  cash used in financing activities increased 344 million  during fiscal year 2015  as compared to fiscal year 2014  primarily due to 337 million used to repurchase and retire common stock during the fiscal year ended march 31 2015  as compared to no stock repurchases during the fiscal year ended march 31 2014  

shortterm investments 

due to our mix of fixed and variable rate securities our shortterm investment portfolio is susceptible to changes in shortterm interest rates as of march 31 2015  our shortterm investments had gross unrealized gains of 1 million  or less than 1 percent of the total in shortterm investments and gross unrealized losses of less than 1 million  or less than 1 percent of the total in shortterm investments from time to time we may liquidate some or all of our shortterm investments to fund operational needs or other activities such as capital expenditures business acquisitions or stock repurchase programs depending on which shortterm investments we liquidate to fund these activities we could recognize a portion or all of the gross unrealized gains or losses 

fiscal 2011 restructuring 

in connection with our fiscal 2011 restructuring plan we expect to incur cash expenditures of approximately 11 million through december 2015 

financing arrangement 

in july 2011  we issued 6325 million  aggregate principal amount of 075 convertible senior notes due 2016 the “notes” we used the net proceeds of the notes to finance the cash consideration of our acquisition of popcap which closed in august 2011 the notes will mature on july 15 2016 unless purchased earlier or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date 

during the fiscal quarter ended march 31 2015  the market value of our common stock exceeded the conversion trigger price of 4126 per share for at least 20 trading days of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding quarter end as a result the notes are convertible at the option of the holder through july 4 2015 see note 12  financing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements as it relates to the notes the convertibility of the notes and the convertible note hedge and warrants which is incorporated by reference into this item 7 

credit facility 

on march 19 2015  we entered into a new 500 million  senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks as of march 31 2015  no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility see note 12  financing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as it relates to our credit facility which is incorporated by reference into this item 7 

financial condition 

we believe that our cash cash equivalents shortterm investments cash generated from operations and available financing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next 12 months including working capital requirements capital expenditures and potentially future acquisitions stock repurchases or strategic investments we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position facilitate expansion repurchase our stock pursue strategic acquisitions and investments andor to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise there can be no assurance however that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms if at all or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 

as of march 31 2015  approximately 1156 million of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions while we have no plans to repatriate these funds to the united states in the short term if we choose to do so we may be required to accrue and pay additional taxes on any portion of the repatriation where no united states income tax had been previously provided 

in may 2014 a special committee of our board of directors on behalf of the full board of directors authorized a twoyear program to repurchase up to 750 million of our common stock we repurchased approximately 8 million  shares under this program during the fiscal year ended march 31 2015  for approximately 337 million 

in may 2015 our board of directors authorized a new program to repurchase up to 1 billion of our common stock this new stock repurchase program which expires on may 31 2017 supersedes and replaces the stock repurchase authorization approved in may 2014 under this program we may purchase stock in the open market or through privatelynegotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws including pursuant to prearranged stock trading plans the timing and actual amount of the stock repurchases will depend on several factors including price capital availability regulatory requirements alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions we are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares under this program and it may be modified suspended or discontinued at any time we continue to actively repurchase shares 

we have a “shelf” registration statement on form s3 on file with the sec this shelf registration statement which includes a base prospectus allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus we would use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes including for working capital financing capital expenditures research and development marketing and distribution efforts and if opportunities arise for acquisitions or strategic alliances pending such uses we may invest the net proceeds in interestbearing securities in addition we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time 

our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those related to customer demand and acceptance of our products our ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due successfully achieving our product release schedules and attaining our forecasted sales objectives the impact of acquisitions and other strategic transactions in which we may engage the impact of competition economic conditions in the united states and abroad the seasonal and cyclical nature of our business and operating results risks of product returns and the other risks described in the “risk factors” section included in part i item 1a of this report 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

note 13  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as it relates to our contractual obligations and commercial commitments is incorporated by reference into this item 7 

offbalance sheet arrangements

inflation 

we believe the impact of inflation on our results of operations has not been significant in any of the past three fiscal years 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market prices which have experienced significant volatility market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below while we do not hedge our shortterm investment portfolio we protect our shortterm investment portfolio against different market risks including interest rate risk as discussed below our cash and cash equivalents portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for speculative trading purposes and do not hedge our market price risk relating to marketable equity securities if any 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency exchange rates international sales are a fundamental part of our business and the significant strengthening of the us dollar during the second half of fiscal year 2015 particularly relative to the euro british pound sterling swedish krona and canadian dollar had a negative impact on our reported international net revenues but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses because these amounts were translated at lower rates in fiscal year 2015 than in fiscal year 2014 while we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risk these activities are limited in the protection that they provide us and can themselves result in losses we currently anticipate foreign currency exchange rates to have a negative impact on our expected reported net revenue in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 but the strengthening of the us dollar is expected to have a positive impact on our reported operating expenses as a significant portion of those expenses are incurred outside the united states 

cash flow hedging activities  from time to time we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreigncurrencydenominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing foreign currency forward contracts that generally have maturities of 15 months  or less these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements in net revenue and research and development expenses 

balance sheet hedging activities  we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily intercompany receivables and payables the foreign currency forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three months or less and are transacted near monthend 

we believe the counterparties to our foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations as of march 31 2015  a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent  or 20 percent  would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value on our foreign currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging of 59 million  and 118 million  respectively as of march 31 2015  a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent  or 20 percent  would have resulted in potential losses on our foreign currency forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of 25 million  and 50 million  respectively this sensitivity analysis assumes an adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates however all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and actual results may differ materially see note 4  derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as it relates to our derivative financial instruments which is incorporated by reference into this item 7a 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities however because shortterm investments mature relatively quickly and are required to be reinvested at the thencurrent market rates interest income on a portfolio consisting of shortterm investments is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term investments additionally the contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to call prepay or otherwise settle the investments at prices less than the stated par value our investments are held for purposes other than trading also we do not use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio 

as of march 31 2015  our shortterm investments were classified as availableforsale securities and consequently were recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in stockholders’ equity 

notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations at any time a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio the following table presents the hypothetical changes in the fair value of our shortterm investment portfolio as of march 31 2015  arising from potential changes in interest rates the modeling technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps

 item 1 business 

overview 

we develop market publish and distribute game software content and services that can be played by consumers on a variety of video game machines and electronic devices which we call “platforms” these platforms include video game consoles such as the microsoft xbox 360 and one and the sony playstation 3 and 4 personal computers “pcs” and mobile phones and tablets 

our strategy 

leverage core intellectual properties 

a cornerstone of our strategy is to leverage established intellectual properties which we call “brands” to create yearround gaming experiences on multiple platforms each capable of delivering additional content and revenue over extended periods of time as an example in recent years we have released yearly iterations of our fifabranded soccer products for console pc and mobile platforms by providing additional content and services for these products we are able to extend the period of time over which consumers engage with these products we also seek to create and similarly leverage new intellectual properties with the potential to become established franchises such as the ea sports ufc mixedmartial arts product expected to be released in june 2014 

our portfolio of brands spans a diverse range of categories including actionadventure casual family fantasy firstperson shooter horror science fiction roleplaying racing simulation sports and strategy and includes whollyowned brands such as battlefield mass effect need for speed dragon age the sims bejeweled and plants v zombies as well as brands based on licensed intellectual property such as fifa madden nfl and star wars 

in our experience leveraging strong brands with mass consumer appeal allows us to create iterative brandbased products and services eg sequels prequels spinoffs and installments that can be sold across a range of platforms to an established consumer base over extended periods of time 

focused product portfolio 

in recent years we have narrowed our product portfolio to reduce costs and to focus on developing products with the potential to become hit products for example in fiscal year 2011 we published over 30 titles for console and pc while in fiscal year 2014 we published 11 in fiscal year 2015 we expect to release 10 titles for console and pc we have similarly reduced the number of major mobile titles we publish 

publish on multiple platforms 

our ability to deliver our products and services across multiple platforms has been and will continue to be another cornerstone of our business strategy we believe the ability to successfully publish across multiple platforms is critical to maintaining and growing our overall consumer base which continues to evolve in response to the introduction of new platforms and platform business models 

 

new onlineenabled gaming platforms such as “microconsoles” offered in entertainment settop boxes have emerged and are expected to continue to emerge in the future we intend to evaluate new platform publishing opportunities on a casebycase basis as they emerge 

digital revenue growth 

we are investing in strategies and capabilities that will allow us to enhance our digitally delivered and onlineenabled product and service offerings historically our revenue came mainly from selling discbased video game products through retailers we call these “packaged goods” products now we also derive significant and increasing revenue from the delivery of games additional content and services through online and wireless networks which we refer to as “digital revenue” for example 

 

we believe that digital revenue which is frequently highermargin relative to packaged goods sales revenue will continue to increase in relative and absolute terms 

direct consumer relationship gamesasaservice 

we believe establishing and maintaining direct relationships with our consumers and supporting the evolution of a gamesasaservice business model are strategic priorities 

by acquiring direct relationships with consumers we are able to market products and services in a direct targeted manner often in response to purchasing history or playing behavior we believe this reduces overall customer acquisition and marketing costs 

with networkconnected gameplay and digitallydelivered content features and services which have become core elements of the experience we offer to consumers we are able to update evolve and refresh our product offerings over extended periods increasing both consumer engagement and product life additionally many of our brands offer different products and services on various respective platforms offering consumers the opportunity to engage with their favorite brands more frequently and at different points in time eg on a console in the home with a mobile device on the go and on a pc at work as a result we can offer consumers an alwayson multiplatform live service organized around one of their favorite brands

we develop products and services from whollyowned intellectual properties we create within our own studios and obtain through acquisitions in addition we obtain content and intellectual property through licenses and service agreements such as those with sports leagues and players’ associations movie studios and performing talent authors and literary publishers music labels music publishers and musicians these agreements typically limit our use of the licensed rights in products for specific time periods in addition our products that play on game consoles and mobile devices or other proprietary platforms may include technology that is owned by the device manufacturer or platform operator and licensed nonexclusively to us for use we also license technology from other providers while we may have renewal rights for some licenses our business and the justification for the development of many of our products is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain the intellectual property rights from the owners of these rights on reasonable terms

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs our business and financial performance could be harmed our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may harm our business and financial performance 

our business is intensely competitive and “hit” driven if we do not deliver “hit” products and services or if consumers prefer our competitors’ products or services over our own our operating results could suffer 

competition in our industry is intense many new products and services are regularly introduced in each major industry segment console mobile and pc freetoplay but only a relatively small number of “hit” titles account for a significant portion of total revenue in each segment our competitors range from large established companies to emerging startups and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge throughout the world if our competitors develop and market more successful products or services offer competitive products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering a better value proposition or if we do not continue to develop consistently highquality and wellreceived products and services our revenue margins and profitability will decline 

in recent years we have narrowed our product portfolio in an effort to focus on developing highquality products with the potential to become “hits” highquality titles even if highlyreviewed may not turn into “hit” products many “hit” products within our industry are iterations of prior hit products with large established consumer bases and significant brand recognition which makes competing in certain product categories challenging in addition hit products or services of our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause our products and services to underperform relative to revenue expectations publishing fewer major titles also concentrates risk in a smaller number of titles and means each major title has greater associated risk the underperformance of a single major title may have a large adverse impact on our financial results 

our operating   results will be adversely affected   if we do not consistently meet our product development schedules or if key events or sports seasons that we tie our product release schedules to are delayed or cancelled 

our business is highly seasonal with the highest levels of consumer demand and a significant percentage of our sales occurring in the quarter ending in december and a seasonal low in sales volume in the quarter ending in june while our sales generally follow this seasonal trend there can be no assurance that this trend will continue if we miss key selling periods for products for any reason including product delays product cancellations or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have developed products our sales are likely to suffer significantly additionally macroeconomic conditions or the occurrence of unforeseen events that negatively impact retailer or consumer buying patterns during the quarter ending in december are likely to affect us disproportionately our ability to meet product development schedules is affected by a number of factors both within and outside our control including the creative processes involved the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams the increasing complexity of our products and the platforms for which they are developed and the need to finetune our products prior to their release we have experienced development delays for our products in the past which caused us to push back or cancel release dates we also seek to release certain products in conjunction with key events such as the beginning of a sports season or major sporting event or the release of a related movie if a key event or sports season to which our product release schedule is tied were to be delayed or cancelled our sales would likely suffer disproportionately in the future any failure to meet anticipated production or release schedules would likely result in a delay of revenue andor possibly a significant shortfall in our revenue increase our development andor marketing expenses harm our profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different than anticipated 

the console segment of the entertainment software industry is cyclical driven by the periodic introduction of new console systems as new console systems are introduced our operating results may be more volatile 

new video game console systems have historically been developed and released every few years which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well in periods of transition from legacy generation consoles to new generation consoles sales of software for legacy generation console systems typically slow or decline in response to the anticipated and actual introduction of new consoles and new generation console software sales typically stabilize after new consoles are widelyestablished with the consumer base 

during fiscal year 2014 consumers responded to the introduction of new consolesthe playstation 4 from sony and xbox one from microsoftby purchasing fewer software products for the sony playstation 3 and microsoft xbox 360 legacy generation 

consoles we expect this trend to continue this trend could also accelerate faster than anticipated and may put downward pressure on legacy generation video game software pricing which could negatively affect our operating results our revenues from new generation software sales may not offset the negative effects of this trend on our operating results in the near term we expect to continue to develop and market products and services for the xbox 360 and playstation 3 while also developing and marketing products and services for the xbox one and playstation 4 we do not control the unit volumes of the new generation console systems made available for sale or the rates at which consumers purchase these consoles as a result our operating results during this transitional period may be more volatile and difficult to predict 

our business is dependent on the success and availability of video game hardware systems and devices manufactured by third parties as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for these systems and devices 

the success of our business is driven in part by the commercial success and adequate supply of video game console systems pcs mobile phones and tablets manufactured by third parties our success also depends on our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be successful in the marketplace and our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for these platforms we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of anticipated platform release dates and may incur significant expense to adjust our product portfolio and development efforts in response to changing consumer platform preferences additionally we may enter into certain exclusive licensing arrangements that affect our ability to deliver or market products or services on certain platforms a platform for which we are developing products and services may not succeed to the extent expected or new platforms may take market share and game software consumers away from platforms for which we have devoted significant resources if consumer demand for the platforms for which we are developing products and services is lower than our expectations we may be unable to fully recover the investments we have made in developing our products and services and our financial performance will be harmed alternatively a platform for which we have not devoted significant resources could be more successful than we had initially anticipated causing us to miss out on meaningful revenue opportunities 

our adoption of new business models could fail to produce our desired financial returns 

we are actively seeking to monetize game properties through a variety of new business models including online distribution of full games and additional content freetoplay games supported by advertising andor microtransactions and subscription services forecasting our revenues and profitability for these new business models is inherently uncertain and volatile our actual revenues and profits for these businesses may be significantly greater or less than our forecasts additionally these new business models could fail for one or more of our titles resulting in the loss of our investment in the development and infrastructure needed to support these new business models and the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from more successful businesses 

technology changes rapidly in our business and if we fail to anticipate or   successfully develop games for new platforms and services adopt new distribution technologies or methods or implement new technologies in our games the quality timeliness and   competitiveness of our products and services will suffer 

rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate sometimes years in advance which technologies we must implement and take advantage of in order to make our products and services competitive in the market we have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies technologies products and services such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the technology we choose to adopt and the platforms products and services that we pursue will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

our product development usually starts with particular platforms and distribution methods in mind and a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve we may not be able to achieve these goals or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly and effectively than we can in either case our products and services may be technologically inferior to our competitors’ less appealing to consumers or both if we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule for our products and services then we may delay their release until these technology goals can be achieved which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses alternatively we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies either to preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up with our competition which would increase our development expenses we may also miss opportunities to adopt technology or develop products and services for new platforms or services that become popular with consumers which could adversely affect our revenues it may take significant time and resources to shift our focus to such technologies or platforms putting us at a competitive disadvantage 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services that harm our business   

we expect to continue to invest in technology hardware and software to support our portfolio of online products and services launching and operating online games and services developing related technologies and implementing online business initiatives is expensive and complex execution of these initiatives could result in inefficiencies or operational failures such as significant user connectivity issues these efforts as well as the deepening integration of online features and functionality into our products and services generally may also result in increased vulnerability to cyber attacks that attempt to damage disrupt or gain unauthorized access to our networks computer systems and supporting infrastructure many of which may be difficult to detect operational failures or successful cyber attacks could lead to consumers being unable to use our products and services or other negative effects upon the products services and user experience we offer possibly resulting in damage to our reputation the loss of current and potential customers and harm to our business in addition our online products and services could be adversely impacted by outages disruptions and failures in basic network and electrical infrastructure as well as in the online platforms of key business partners who offer or support our products and services 

our business could be adversely affected if our consumer protection data privacy and security practices are not adequate or perceived as being inadequate to prevent data breaches or by the application of consumer protection and data privacy laws generally 

in the course of our business we collect process store and use consumer information including personal information passwords and credit card information although we take measures to protect consumer information from unauthorized access acquisition disclosure and misuse our security controls may not be able to prevent the improper or unauthorized access acquisition or disclosure of such consumer information in addition third party vendors and business partners which in the course of our business receive access to consumer information that we collect also may not be able to prevent data security breaches with respect to the consumer information we provide them the unauthorized access acquisition or disclosure of consumer information could significantly harm our reputation compel us to comply with disparate breach notification laws and otherwise subject us to substantial legal liability a perception that we do not adequately secure consumer information could result in a loss of current or potential consumers and business partners as well as a loss of anticipated revenues our key business partners also face these same risks with respect to consumer information they collect and data security breaches with respect to such information could cause reputational harm to them and negatively impact our ability to offer our products and services through their platforms 

in addition the rate of privacy lawmaking is accelerating globally and the interpretation and application of consumer protection and data privacy laws in the united states europe and elsewhere are often uncertain contradictory and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted or applied in a manner that is adverse to us or otherwise inconsistent with our practices which could result in litigation potential legal liability or require us to change our practices in a manner adverse to our business as a result our reputation may be harmed we could incur substantial costs and we could lose both customers and revenues 

our reputation with consumers is critical to our success as a company negative consumer perceptions about our brands products services andor business practices may damage our business and the costs incurred in addressing consumer concerns may increase our operating expenses 

individual consumers form our ultimate customer base and consumer expectations regarding the quality performance and integrity of our products and services are high consumers may be critical of our brands products services andor business practices for a wide variety of reasons these negative consumer reactions may not be foreseeable or within our control to manage effectively including perceptions about gameplay fairness negative player reactions to game content components and services or objections to certain of our business practices we value our consumers and expect to take actions to address consumer concerns as appropriate including actions that may result in additional expenditures and the loss of revenue negative consumer sentiment about our business practices can also result in investigations from regulatory agencies and consumer groups as well as litigation which regardless of their outcome may be damaging to our reputation and harm our business 

if we release defective products or services our operating results could suffer 

products and services such as ours are extremely complex software programs and are difficult to develop and distribute we have quality controls in place to detect defects in our products and services before they are released nonetheless these quality controls are subject to human error overriding and reasonable resource constraints therefore these quality controls and preventative measures may not be effective in detecting defects in our products and services before they have been released 

into the marketplace in such an event we could be required to or may find it necessary to voluntarily recall a product or suspend the availability of the product or service which could significantly harm our business and operating results 

our business is subject to increasing regulation and the adoption of proposed legislation we oppose could negatively impact our business 

legislation is continually being introduced in the united states and other countries to mandate rating requirements or set other restrictions on the advertisement or distribution of entertainment software based on content in the united states most courts including the united states supreme court that have ruled on such legislation have ruled in a manner favorable to the interactive entertainment industry some foreign countries have adopted ratings regulations and certain countries allow government censorship of entertainment software products adoption of government ratings system or restrictions on distribution of entertainment software based on content could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers and compliance with new and possibly inconsistent regulations for different territories could be costly or delay the release of our products 

as we increase the online delivery of our products and services we are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet in addition laws and regulations relating to user privacy data collection and retention content advertising and information security have been adopted or are being considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation furthermore any failure on our part to comply with these laws or the application of these laws in an unanticipated manner may harm our business 

if we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel we will be unable to   effectively conduct our business 

the market for technical creative marketing and other personnel essential to the development and marketing of our products and management of our businesses is extremely competitive our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of executives and key creative and technical talent if we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need or replace key employees following their departure our ability to develop and manage our business will be impaired 

if our marketing and advertising efforts fail to resonate with our customers our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs such as television and online advertising print advertising retail merchandising website development event sponsorship and direct communications with our consumers our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part upon the success of these programs if the marketing for our products and services fail to resonate with our customers particularly during the critical holiday season or during other key selling periods or if advertising rates or other media placement costs increase these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

a significant portion of our sales are made to a relatively small number of key   customers if these customers reduce their purchases of our products or become   unable to pay for them our business could be harmed 

during the fiscal year ended march 31 2014  approximately 68 percent  of our north america net revenue was derived from our top ten customers though our products are available to consumers through a variety of retailers and directly through us the concentration of our sales in one or a few large customers could lead to a shortterm disruption in our sales if one or more of these customers significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to carry our products and could make us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers became unable to pay for our products or declared bankruptcy additionally our receivables from these large customers increase significantly in the december quarter as they make purchases in anticipation of the holiday selling season having such a large portion of our total net revenue concentrated in a few customers could reduce our negotiating leverage with these customers if one or more of our key customers experience deterioration in their business or become unable to obtain sufficient financing to maintain their operations our business could be harmed 

our channel partners have significant influence over the products and services that we offer on their platforms 

  

our products and services are sold to customers primarily through retailers and online through our channel partners including sony microsoft apple and google in many cases our channel partners set the rates that we must pay to provide our games and services through their online channels in certain cases our channel partners retain flexibility to change their fee structures or adopt different fee structures for their online channels which could adversely impact our costs profitability and margins 

outside of the financial arrangements our agreements with our channel partners typically give them significant control over other aspects of the distribution of the products and services that we develop for their platform for example our agreements with sony and microsoft typically give significant control to them over the approval manufacturing and distribution of our products and services which could in certain circumstances leave us unable to get our products and services approved manufactured and distributed to customers for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014  55 percent of our net revenue was derived from products and services for sony’s playstation 3 and 4 and microsoft’s xbox 360 and one consoles combined across all four platforms for our digital products and services delivered direct to consumers via digital channels such as sony’s playstation network microsoft’s xbox live marketplace apple’s app store and the google play store the channel partner has policies and guidelines that control the promotion and distribution of these titles and the features and functionalities that we are permitted to offer through the channel 

in addition while we have negotiated agreements in place with our channel partners  these agreements reserve the right by our channel partners to determine and change unilaterally certain key terms and conditions including the ability to change their user and developer policies and guidelines which can negatively impact our business if our channel partners establish terms that restrict our offerings through their channels or significantly impact the financial terms on which these products or services are offered to our customers our business could be harmed 

acquisitions investments and other strategic transactions could result in   operating difficulties dilution to our investors and other negative   consequences 

we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into other strategic transactions including 1 acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets 2 minority investments in strategic partners and 3 investments in new interactive entertainment businesses eg online and mobile publishing platforms as part of our longterm business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment that we acquire unknown liabilities or that we experience difficulty in the integration of business systems and technologies the integration and retention of new employees or in the maintenance of key business and customer relationships of the businesses we acquire or diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses these events could harm our operating results or financial condition 

future acquisitions and investments could also involve the issuance of our equity and equitylinked securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses such as stockbased compensation any of the foregoing factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating performance that could have otherwise been achieved by us on a standalone basis our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

if we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to include intellectual property owned by others in our games or to maintain or acquire the rights to publish or distribute games developed by others our business may be harmed 

many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our ea sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players’ associations similarly other products are based on film and literary licenses and our hasbro products are based on a license for certain of hasbro’s toy and game properties we also publish and distribute products developed and owned by thirdparties under license agreements with these parties competition for these licenses and rights is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses and rights or obtain additional licenses or rights with significant commercial value our revenues profitability and cash flows may decline significantly competition for these licenses may also drive up the advances guarantees and royalties that we must pay to licensors and developers which could significantly increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

our business is subject to risks generally associated with the entertainment industry any of which could significantly harm our operating results 

our business is subject to risks that are generally associated with the entertainment industry many of which are beyond our control these risks could negatively impact our operating results and include the popularity price and timing of our games and the platforms on which they are played economic conditions that adversely affect discretionary consumer spending changes in consumer demographics the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted 

we rely on business partners in many areas of our business and our business may be harmed if they are unable to honor their obligations to us or their actions may put us at risk 

we rely on various business partners including thirdparty service providers vendors licensing partners development partners and licensees among others in many areas of our business the actions of our business partners may put our business and our reputation at risk in many cases these third parties are given access to sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support to our teams these third parties may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it the failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies or the failure of the third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies could result in a disruption to our business operations further disruptions in the financial markets and economic downturns may adversely affect our business partners and they may not be able to continue honoring their obligations to us alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner or vendor if we lose one or more significant business partners our business could be harmed 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights which could harm our business   

from time to time third parties may assert claims against us relating to patents copyrights trademarks personal publicity rights or other intellectual property rights related to technologies products content or deliverypayment methods that are important to our business although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement for example we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from certain individuals and companies who have acquired patent portfolios for the sole purpose of asserting such claims against other companies in addition many of our products are highly realistic and feature materials that are based on real world examples which may be the subject of intellectual property infringement claims of others from time to time we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims existing or future infringement claims against us whether valid or not may be time consuming and expensive to defend such claims or litigations could require us to pay damages and other costs stop selling the affected products redesign those products to avoid infringement or obtain a license all of which could be costly and harm our business in addition many patents have been issued that may apply to potential new modes of delivering playing or monetizing game software products and services such as those that we produce or would like to offer in the future we may discover that future opportunities to provide new and innovative modes of game play and game delivery to consumers may be precluded by existing patents that we are unable to license on reasonable terms 

from time to time we may become involved in other legal proceedings which could   adversely affect us 

we are currently and from time to time in the future may become subject to legal proceedings claims litigation and government investigations or inquiries which could be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations in addition the outcome of any legal proceedings claims litigation investigations or inquiries may be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

our products are subject to the threat of piracy and unauthorized copying 

we take measures to protect our prerelease software and other confidential information from unauthorized access a security breach that results in the disclosure of prerelease software or other confidential assets could lead or contribute to piracy of our games or otherwise compromise our product plans 

further entertainment software piracy is a persistent problem in our industry the growth in peertopeer networks and other channels to download pirated copies of our products the increasing availability of broadband access to the internet and the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures used with our products all have contributed to an expansion in piracy though we take technical steps to make the unauthorized copying of our products more difficult as do the 

providers of the video game systems personal computers mobile phones and tablets on which our games are played these efforts may not be successful in controlling the piracy of our products 

while legal protections exist to combat piracy and other forms of unauthorized copying preventing and curbing infringement through enforcement of our intellectual property rights may be difficult costly and time consuming particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights further the scope of the legal protection of copyright and prohibitions against the circumvention of technological protection measures to protect copyrighted works are often under scrutiny by courts and governing bodies the repeal or weakening of laws intended to combat piracy protect intellectual property and prohibit the circumvention of technological protection measures could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect against piracy these factors could have a negative effect on our growth and profitability in the future 

our business is subject to currency fluctuations 

international sales are a fundamental part of our business for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014  international net revenue comprised 58 percent of our total net revenue we expect international sales to continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue such sales may be subject to unexpected regulatory requirements tariffs and other barriers additionally foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies which may fluctuate against the us dollar in addition our foreign investments and our cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies are subject to currency fluctuations we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency risk however these activities are limited in the protection they provide us from foreign currency fluctuations and can themselves result in losses in the past the disruption in the global financial markets has impacted many of the financial institutions with which we do business and we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to such institutions with whom we enter into hedging transactions a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of a disruption in the financial markets could negatively impact our treasury operations including our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs accordingly our results of operations including our reported net revenue operating expenses and net income and financial condition can be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations especially the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar and swedish krona 

we utilize debt financing and such indebtedness could adversely impact our business and financial condition 

in july 2011 we issued 6325 million aggregate principal amount of 075 convertible senior notes due 2016 the “notes” resulting in debt service obligations on the notes of approximately 5 million per year in addition in august 2012 we entered into an unsecured committed 500 million revolving credit facility while the facility is currently undrawn we may use the proceeds of any future borrowings for general corporate purposes the credit facility contains affirmative negative and financial covenants including a maximum capitalization ratio and minimum liquidity requirements 

we intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash generated by our operations and from our existing cash and investments we may enter into other financial instruments in the future 

       our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for example it could 

 

we may not have enough available cash or be able to arrange for financing to pay such principal amount at the time we are required to make purchases of the notes or convert the notes in addition we may be required to use funds that are domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions in order to make the cash payments upon any purchase or conversion of the notes if we were to choose to use such funds we would be required to accrue any additional taxes on any portion of the repatriation where no united states income tax had been previously provided 

the hedge transactions and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the notes may affect the value of the notes and our common stock 

in connection with the offering of the notes we entered into privatelynegotiated convertible note hedge transactions the “convertible note hedge” with certain counterparties “options counterparties” to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes the convertible note hedge covers subject to antidilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the notes the number of shares of common stock underlying the notes we also entered into separate privatelynegotiated warrant transactions with the certain counterparties whereby we sold to independent third parties warrants the “warrants” with the option counterparties relating to the same number of shares of our common stock subject to customary antidilution adjustments 

the effect if any of these activities including the direction or magnitude on the market price of our common stock will depend on a variety of factors including market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities could however adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes 

in addition the option counterparties are financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that one or more of the option counterparties might default under the convertible note hedge our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral if any of the option counterparties becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under the convertible note hedge with such option counterparty our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and accruals for other taxes and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by our profit levels by changes in our business reorganization of our business and operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the elections we make changes in applicable tax laws or changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as well as other factors we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions furthermore we are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities with respect to both income and such other nonincome taxes adverse changes in our effective income tax rate unfavorable audit results or tax rulings or other changes resulting in significant additional tax liabilities could have material adverse effects upon our earnings cash flows and financial condition 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in   financial accounting standards 

our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting standards promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies for example accounting standards affecting software revenue recognition have affected and could continue to significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products and services we recognize all of the revenue from bundled sales ie onlineenabled games that include updates on a whenandifavailable basis or a matchmaking service on a deferred basis over an estimated offering period the financial accounting standards board “fasb” is currently evaluating the accounting and financial reporting for revenue transactions we believe the current proposal by the fasb would require us to materially change the way we account for revenue by requiring us to recognize more revenue upon delivery of the primary product than we currently do under current accounting standards 

as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue and taxes could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors above as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts’ earnings estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts’ and investors’ 

expectations to factors affecting the entertainment computer software internet media or electronics industries to our ability to successfully integrate any acquisitions we may make or to national or international economic conditions in particular economic downturns may contribute to the public stock markets experiencing extreme price and trading volume volatility these broad market fluctuations have and could continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following overview is a highlevel discussion of our operating results as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers is important in order to understand our results for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014  as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form 10k including in the “business” section and the “risk factors” above the remainder of this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda”” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

about electronic arts 

we develop market publish and distribute game software content and services that can be played by consumers on a variety of platforms including video game consoles such as playstation 3 and 4 from sony and xbox 360 and xbox one from microsoft personal computers mobile phones and tablets our ability to deliver games and services across multiple platforms through multiple distribution channels and directly to consumers online and wirelessly has been and will continue to be a cornerstone of our product strategy we have adopted new business models and alternative revenue streams such as subscription microtransactions and advertising in connection with our online and wireless product and service offerings some of our games are based on our whollyowned intellectual property  eg  battlefield mass effect need for speed dragon age the sims bejeweled and plants vs zombies and some of our games are based on content that we license from others  eg  fifa madden nfl and star wars our goal is to turn our intellectual properties into yearround businesses available on a range of platforms our products and services may be purchased through physical and online retailers platform providers such as console manufacturers and mobile carriers via digital downloads as well as directly through our own distribution platform including online portals such as origin 

financial results 

total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014  was 3575 million  a decrease of 222 million  or 6 percent  as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2013  primarily due to an increase in our estimated offering period for physical games sold through retail from six to nine months partially offset by an increase in net revenue before revenue deferral at march 31 2014  deferred net revenue associated with sales of onlineenabled games increased  by 446 million  as compared to march 31 2013  directly decreasing the amount of reported net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2014  at march 31 2013  deferred net revenue associated with sales of onlineenabled games decreased  by 4 million  as compared to march 31 2012  directly increasing the amount of reported net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2013  disregarding the impact of the deferred net revenue reported net revenue would have increased by approximately 228 million  or 6  during fiscal year 2014  as compared to the fiscal year 2013  net revenue for fiscal year 2014  was driven by fifa 14  fifa 13  and  battlefield 4    battlefield 4  which delivers 60 framespersecond gameplay for 64 players two commanders on tablets and other innovative features was launched on five gaming platforms including two new consoles it has performed well in the fiscal year despite unanticipated launch issues 

net income for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014  was 8 million  as compared to 98 million  for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013  diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014  was 003  as compared to a diluted earnings per share of 031  for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013  net income decreased for fiscal year 2014  as compared to the fiscal year 2013  primarily as a result of 1 a 181 million  decrease in gross profit due to an increase in our estimated offering period for physical games sold through retail after july 1 2013 and a higher percentage of our sales being subject to deferral which further delayed the recognition of revenue 2 a 56 million  increase in general and administrative costs and 3 a 39 million  decrease in our gains on strategic investments due to the sale of our investment in neowiz during fiscal year 2013  these increases in costs were partially offset by 1 a 108 million  decrease in marketing and sales expenses primarily due to a decrease in headcount and reduced advertising and promotional spending on our franchises 2 a 28 million  decrease in research and development costs and 3 a 28 million  decrease in restructuring and other charges as a result of the fiscal 2013 restructuring plan in fiscal year 2013  as compared to none in fiscal year 2014  

  

trends in our business 

console system transition  in november 2013 the playstation 4 from sony and xbox one from microsoft were released ea delivered five major products for each of these newgeneration console systems around the time of their launch and we are continuing to make significant investments in products and services for these new consoles we also expect to continue to develop and market products and services for the microsoft xbox 360 and the sony playstation 3 industry sales of major 

games for these legacy consoles declined significantly during our 2014 fiscal year this sales decline trend is likely to continue and may accelerate the success of our products and services for the newgeneration consoles depends in part on the commercial success and adequate supply of as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for these consoles 

digital transformation  our business continues to transform from a traditional packaged goods business model to one in which our games and services are sold and delivered via a network connection with digitallydelivered content features and services helping to extend the life of the respective game offering for example many of our products that traditionally have been sold only as packaged goods products can now also be purchased and downloaded via a network connection we also include digitallydelivered content features and services as part of the product offering either made available for free or at additional cost additionally our mobile and pc freetoplay games are available solely via digital delivery and are typically monetized through a microtransaction business model through which we sell incremental content andor features in discrete transactions 

we significantly increased the digital revenue that we derive from wireless internetderived and advertising products and services from 1159 million in fiscal year 2012  to 1440 million in fiscal year 2013  during fiscal year 2014  digital revenue was 1833 million and we expect this portion of our business to continue to grow in fiscal 2015  and beyond 

mobile and pc freetoplay games  the proliferation of mobile phones and tablets has significantly increased the consumer base for mobile games the broad consumer acceptance of freetoplay business models which allow consumers to try new games with no upfront cost and pay for additional content or ingame items through microtransactions has led to growth in the mobile gaming industry likewise the mass introduction and wide consumer acceptance of freetoplay microtransactionbased pc games played over the internet has also broadened our consumer base we expect revenue generated from mobile and pc freetoplay games to remain an important part of our business 

concentration of sales among the most popular games  in all major segments of our industry we see a larger portion of games sales concentrated on the most popular titles and many of those titles are sequels of prior games we have responded to this trend by significantly reducing the number of games that we produce to provide greater focus on our most promising intellectual properties for example in fiscal year 2011  we published over 30 titles for consoles and pc while in fiscal year 2014  we published 11 in fiscal year 2015  we expect to release 10 titles for console and pc we have similarly reduced the number of major mobile titles that we publish 

  

recent developments 

stock repurchase program in may 2014 a special committee of our board of directors on behalf of the full board of directors authorized a new program to repurchase up to 750 million  of our common stock this new stock repurchase program which expires on may 31 2016 supersedes and replaces the stock repurchase authorization approved by our board of directors in july 2012 under this program we may purchase stock in the open market or through privatelynegotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws including pursuant to prearranged stock trading plans the timing and actual amount of the stock repurchases will depend on several factors including price capital availability regulatory requirements alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions we are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares under this program and it may be modified suspended or discontinued at any time 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities contingent assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown as a result actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

revenue recognition sales returns and allowances and bad debt reserves 

we derive revenue principally from sales of interactive software games and related content and services on 1 video game consoles such as playstation 3 and 4 from sony and xbox 360 and xbox one from microsoft and pcs and 2 mobile phones and tablets we evaluate revenue recognition based on the criteria set forth in fasb accounting standards codification “asc” 605 revenue recognition and asc 985605 software revenue recognition  we classify our revenue as either product revenue or service and other revenue 

product revenue  our product revenue includes revenue associated with the sale of software games or related content whether delivered via a physical disc  e  g  packaged goods or delivered digitally via the internet  eg  fullgame downloads microtransactions and licensing of game software to thirdparties product revenue also includes revenue from mobile full game downloads that do not require our hosting support and sales of tangible products such as hardware peripherals or collectors’ items 

service and other revenue  our service revenue includes revenue recognized from timebased subscriptions and games or related content that requires our hosting support in order to utilize the game or related content  ie  can only be played with an internet connection this includes 1 entitlements to content that are accessed through hosting services  eg  microtransactions for internetbased social network and mobile games 2 massively multiplayer online “mmo” games both software game and subscription sales 3 subscriptions for our battlefield premium and pogobranded online game services and 4 allocated service revenue from sales of software games with an online service element  ie “matchmaking” service our other revenue includes advertising and nonsoftware licensing revenue 

with respect to the allocated service revenue from sales of software games with a matchmaking service mentioned above our allocation of proceeds between product and service revenue for presentation purposes is based on management’s best estimate of the selling price of the matchmaking service with the residual value allocated to product revenue our estimate of the selling price of the matchmaking service is comprised of several factors including but not limited to prior selling prices for the matchmaking service prices charged separately by other thirdparty vendors for similar service offerings and a costplusmargin approach we review the estimated selling price of the online matchmaking service on a regular basis and use this methodology consistently to allocate revenue between product and service for software game sales with a matchmaking service 

we evaluate and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met 

 

 

 

 

onlineenabled games 

the majority of our software games can be connected to the internet whereby a consumer may be able to download unspecified content or updates on a whenandifavailable basis “unspecified updates” for use with the original game software in addition we may also offer an online matchmaking service that permits consumers to play against each other via the internet without a separate fee us gaap requires us to account for the consumer’s right to receive unspecified updates or the matchmaking service for no additional fee as a “bundled” sale or multipleelement arrangement 

we have an established historical pattern of providing unspecified updates to onlineenabled games  eg  player roster updates to madden nfl 25  at no additional charge to the consumer we do not have vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” for these unspecified updates and thus as required by us gaap we recognize revenue from the sale of these onlineenabled games over the period we expect to offer the unspecified updates to the consumer “estimated offering period” 

estimated offering period 

because the offering period is not an explicitly defined period we must make an estimate of the offering period determining the estimated offering period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage for example in determining the estimated offering period for unspecified updates associated with our onlineenabled games we 

consider the period of time consumers are online as online connectivity is required on an annual basis we review consumers’ online gameplay of all onlineenabled games that have been released 12 to 24 months prior to the evaluation date for example if our evaluation date is april 1 2013 we evaluate all onlineenabled games released between april 1 2011 and march 31 2012 based on this population of games for all players that register the game online within the first six months of release of the game to the general public we compute the weightedaverage number of days for each onlineenabled game based on when a player initially registers the game online to when that player last plays the game online we then compute the weightedaverage number of days for all onlineenabled games by multiplying the weightedaverage number of days for each onlineenabled game by its relative percentage of total units sold from these onlineenabled games  ie  a game with more units sold will have a higher weighting to the overall computation than a game with fewer units sold under a similar computation we also consider the estimated period of time between the date a game unit is sold to a reseller and the date the reseller sells the game unit to an end consumer  ie  time in channel based on these two calculations we then consider the method of distribution for example   physical software games sold at retail would have a composite offering period equal to the online gameplay plus time in channel as opposed to digitally distributed software games which are delivered immediately via digital download and thus have no concept of channel additionally we consider results from prior years known online gameplay trends as well as disclosed service periods for competitors’ games in determining the estimated offering period for future sales 

while we consistently apply this methodology inherent assumptions used in this methodology include which onlineenabled games to sample whether to use only units that have registered online whether to weight the number of days for each game whether to weight the days based on the units sold of each game determining the period of time between the date of sale to reseller and the date of sale to the consumer and assessing online gameplay trends 

prior to july 1 2013 for most sales we estimated the offering period to be six months and recognized revenue over this period in the month after delivery during the three months ended june 30 2013 we completed our annual evaluation of the estimated offering period and noted that generally consumers are playing our games online over a longer period of time based on this we concluded that for physical software sales made after june 30 2013 the estimated offering period should be increased to nine months resulting in revenue being recognized over a longer period of time the estimated offering period for digitally distributed software games is six months 

other multipleelement arrangements 

in some of our multipleelement arrangements we sell tangible products with software andor softwarerelated offerings these tangible products are generally either peripherals or ancillary collectors’ items such as figurines and comic books revenue for these arrangements is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each deliverable using the relative selling prices of each deliverable in the arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy described below if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable the arrangement consideration is allocated to the software deliverables as a group and then allocated to each software deliverable in accordance with asc 985605 

we determine the selling price for a tangible product deliverable based on the following selling price hierarchy vsoe  ie  the price we charge when the tangible product is sold separately if available thirdparty evidence “tpe” of fair value  ie  the price charged by others for similar tangible products if vsoe is not available or our best estimate of selling price “besp” if neither vsoe nor tpe is available determining the besp is a subjective process that is based on multiple factors including but not limited to recent selling prices and related discounts market conditions customer classes sales channels and other factors in accordance with asc 605 provided the other three revenue recognition criteria other than delivery have been met we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer as we have no further obligations 

we must make assumptions and judgments in order to 1 determine whether and when each element is delivered 2 determine whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element and 3 allocate the total price among the various elements as applicable changes to any of these assumptions and judgments or changes to the elements in the arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

principal agent considerations 

in accordance with asc 60545  revenue recognition principal agent considerations  we evaluate sales of our interactive software games via third party storefronts including digital storefronts such as xbox live marketplace sony psn apple appstore google play in order to determine whether or not we are acting as the principal or as an agent which we consider in determining if revenue should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the storefront key indicators that we evaluate in determining gross versus net treatment include but are not limited to the following 

 based on the evaluation of the above indicators we have determined that we are generally acting as an agent and are not considered the primary obligor to consumers for our interactive software games distributed through third party digital storefronts we therefore recognize revenue related to these arrangements on a net basis

we reduce revenue primarily for estimated future returns and price protection which may occur with our distributors and retailers “channel partners” price protection represents our practice to provide our channel partners with a credit allowance to lower their wholesale price on a particular product in the channel the amount of the price protection is generally the difference between the old wholesale price and the new reduced wholesale price in certain countries for our pc and console packaged goods software products we also have a practice of allowing channel partners to return older software products in the channel in exchange for a credit allowance as a general practice we do not give cash refunds 

when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances we analyze the following historical credit allowances current sellthrough of our channel partners’ inventory of our software products current trends in retail and the video game industry changes in customer demand acceptance of our software products and other related factors in addition we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection in subsequent periods 

in the future actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold software products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms product updates or competing software products while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters these estimates are inherently subjective accordingly if our estimates change our returns and price protection allowances would change and would impact the total net revenue accounts receivable and deferred net revenue that we report 

we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating the following customer creditworthiness current economic trends historical experience age of current accounts receivable balances changes in financial condition or payment terms of our customers significant management judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly as a result of a change in any of the evaluation factors mentioned above 

fair value estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item in order to fairly present our financial statements without an independent market or another representative transaction determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the accounting 

there are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value these include 1 the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value 2 the income approach which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example future cash flows or future earnings to a single present value amount and 3 the cost approach which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset for many of our fair value estimates including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets we use the income approach using the income approach requires the use of financial models which require us to make various estimates including but not limited to 1 the potential future cash flows for the asset or liability being measured 2 the timing of receipt or payment of those 

future cash flows 3 the time value of money associated with the expected receipt or payment of such cash flows and 4 the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium making these cash flow estimates is inherently difficult and subjective and if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate our financial results may be negatively impacted furthermore relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact to the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached for example a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired 

while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions the following areas are the most sensitive to these assessments 

business combinations    we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities and contingencies assumed acquired inprocess technology and contingent consideration issued in a business combination our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various estimated useful lives furthermore the estimated fair value assigned to an acquired asset or liability has a direct impact on the amount we recognize as goodwill which is an asset that is not amortized determining the fair value of assets acquired requires an assessment of the highest and best use or the expected price to sell the asset and the related expected future cash flows determining the fair value of acquired inprocess technology also requires an assessment of our expectations related to the use of that technology determining the fair value of an assumed liability requires an assessment of the expected cost to transfer the liability determining the fair value of contingent consideration requires an assessment of the probabilityweighted expected future cash flows over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled and applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration payable are forecasted earnings significant changes in forecasted earnings would result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurement this fair value assessment is also required in periods subsequent to a business combination such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

assessment of impairment of goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets   current accounting standards require that we assess the recoverability of our finite lived acquisitionrelated intangible assets and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets is potentially impaired in order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred management must make various assumptions about the estimated fair value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated future cash flows for some assets our estimated fair value is dependent upon predicting which of our products will be successful this success is dependent upon several factors such as which operating platforms will be successful in the marketplace also our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules judgments and assumptions about future cash flows and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to significant negative industry or economic trends significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the strategy of our overall business and significant underperformance relative to projected future operating results when we consider such assets to be impaired the amount of impairment we recognize is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

in assessing impairment on our goodwill we first analyze qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the qualitative factors we assess include longterm prospects of our performance share price trends and market capitalization and company specific events if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount we do not need to perform the twostep impairment test if based on that assessment we believe it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value a twostep goodwill impairment test will be performed the first step measures for impairment by applying fair valuebased tests at the reporting unit level the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit reporting units are determined by the components of operating segments that constitute a business for which 1 discrete financial information is available 2 segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component and 3 whether the component has dissimilar economic characteristics to other components 

as of our last annual assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount and as such we did not need to perform the twostep impairment test we have not identified any indicators of impairment since that assessment 

our business consists of developing marketing and distributing video game software using both established and emerging intellectual properties and our forecasts for emerging intellectual properties are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information and have an inherently higher risk of inaccuracy if future forecasts are revised they may indicate or require future impairment charges we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

  

royalties and licenses 

our royalty expenses consist of payments to 1 content licensors 2 independent software developers and 3 copublishing and distribution affiliates license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities professional sports organizations movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks copyrights personal publicity rights content andor other intellectual property royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games copublishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of products 

royaltybased obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid these royaltybased obligations are generally expensed to cost of revenue generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on the total projected net revenue for contracts with guaranteed minimums significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors including 1 the total number of titles subject to the contract 2 the timing of the release of these titles 3 the number of software units we expect to sell which can be impacted by a number of variables including product quality number of platforms we release on the timing of the title’s release and competition and 4 future pricing determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products furthermore if we conclude that we are unable to make a reasonably reliable forecast of projected net revenue we recognize royalty expense at the greater of contract rate or on a straightline basis over the term of the contract accordingly if our future revenue projections change our effective royalty rates would change which could impact the amount and timing of royalty expense we recognize 

prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and copublishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product and therefore we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product accordingly payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred payments due after completion of the product primarily royaltybased in nature are generally expensed as cost of revenue 

our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor when performance remains with the licensor we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract royalty liabilities are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next 12 months 

each quarter we also evaluate the expected future realization of our royaltybased assets as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales any impairments or losses determined before the launch of a product are generally charged to research and development expense impairments or losses determined postlaunch are charged to cost of revenue we evaluate longlived royaltybased assets for impairment generally using undiscounted cash flows when impairment indicators exist unrecognized minimum royaltybased commitments are accounted for as executory contracts and therefore any losses on these commitments are recognized when the underlying intellectual property is abandoned  ie  cease use or the contractual rights to use the intellectual property are terminated 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carryforwards we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified it is generally difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is significant negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years forecasts of future taxable 

income are considered to be less objective than past results particularly in light of the economic environment therefore cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 

in addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities the carry back of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law and the implementation of tax planning strategies evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence this evaluation involves assumptions about future activity certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets 

based on the assumptions and requirements noted above we have recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets in addition we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability in the us or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggest that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized 

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate these estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation as well as with respect to other matters such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities the ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations in addition changes in our business including acquisitions changes in our international corporate structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix and amount of income as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities valuation allowances applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate 

results of operations 

our fiscal year is reported on a 52 or 53week period that ends on the saturday nearest march 31 our results of operations for the fiscal years ended march 31 2014 2013 and 2012  each contained 52 weeks and ended on march 29 2014 march 30 2013 and march 31 2012 respectively for simplicity of disclosure all fiscal periods are referred to as ending on a calendar monthend 

net revenue 

net revenue consists of sales generated from 1 video games sold as packaged goods or as digital downloads and designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation 3 and 4 from sony and xbox 360 and one from microsoft and pcs 2 video games for mobile phones and tablets  3 separate software products and content and online game services associated with these products 4 licensing our game software to third parties 5 allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products and 6 advertisements on our online web pages and in our games 

we provide three different measures of our net revenue two of these measures are presented in accordance with us gaap    1 net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue and 2 net revenue by geography the third measure is a nongaap financial measure  net revenue before revenue deferral by revenue composition which is primarily based on method of distribution we use this third nongaap financial measure internally to evaluate our operating performance when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods and when assessing the performance of our management team 

management places a greater emphasis and focus on assessing our business through a review of the net revenue before revenue deferral by revenue composition than by net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue these two measures differ as 1 net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue reflects the deferral and recognition of revenue in periods subsequent to the date of sale due to us gaap while net revenue before revenue deferral by revenue composition does not and 2 both measures contain a different aggregation of sales from one another for instance service and other revenue does not include a portion of our fullgame digital download and mobile sales that are fully included in our digital revenue further service and other revenue includes all of our revenue associated with mmo games while software sales associated with our mmos are included in either digital revenue or packaged goods and other revenue depending on whether the sale was a fullgame digital download or a packaged goods sale 

comparison of fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2013 

net revenue 

for fiscal year 2014  net revenue was 3575 million  and decreased   222 million  or 6 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2013  this decrease was driven by a 745 million decrease in revenue primarily from the mass effect madden nfl medal of honor the sims and fifa street franchises this decrease was partially offset by a 523 million increase in revenue primarily from the battlefield simcity crysis franchises and the simpsons tapped out 

net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue 

our total net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue for fiscal years 2014 and 2013  was as follows in millions 



product revenue 

for fiscal year 2014  product revenue was 2134 million  primarily driven by  fifa 14  battlefield 4  and fifa 13  product revenue decreased   604 million  or 22 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2013  this decrease was driven by an 842 million decrease primarily from the mass effect madden nfl fifa medal of honor and fifa street franchises this decrease was partially offset by a 238 million increase primarily from the battlefield dead space and crysis franchises 

service and other revenue 

for fiscal year 2014  service and other revenue was 1441 million  primarily driven by fifa ultimate team star wars the old republic and  simcity  service and other revenue for fiscal year 2014   increased   382 million  or 36 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2013  this increase was driven by a 468 million increase primarily from the fifa and simcity franchises and the simpsons tapped out  this increase was partially offset by an 86 million decrease primarily from lower revenue from the sims social  which shut down in june 2013 star wars the old republic as well as pogobranded online game services 

net revenue by geography 

we attribute net revenue from external customers to individual countries based on the location of the legal entity that sells the products andor services note that revenue attributed to the legal entity that makes the sale is often not the country where the consumer resides for example revenue generated by our swiss legal entities includes digital revenue from consumers who reside outside of switzerland including consumers who reside outside of europe revenue generated by our swiss legal entities during fiscal year 2014  represented 1171 million  or 33 percent  of our total net revenue revenue generated by our swiss legal entities during fiscal year 2013  represented 885 million  or 23 percent  of our total net revenue revenue generated in the united states represents over 99 percent  of our total north america net revenue no other country represented greater than 10 percent  of total net revenue 



net revenue in north america was 1510 million  or 42 percent  of total net revenue for fiscal year 2014  compared to 1701 million  or 45 percent  of total net revenue for fiscal year 2013  a decrease  of 191 million  or 11 percent  net revenue in north 

america decreased primarily due to decreased revenue in our mass effect madden nfl medal of honor fifa franchises and kingdoms of amalur reckoning  partially offset by increased revenue in our battlefield simcity dead space franchises and the simpsons tapped out  during fiscal year 2014  international net revenue was 2065 million  or 58 percent  of total net revenue during fiscal year 2014  compared to 2096 million  or 55 percent  of total net revenue during fiscal year 2013  a decrease  of 31 million  or 1 percent  we estimate that foreign exchange rates primarily due to the euro decreased reported international net revenue by approximately 61 million or 3 percent for fiscal year 2014  as compared to the exchange rates in effect for the fiscal year 2013  excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates from international net revenue we estimate that international net revenue increased by approximately 30 million or 1 percent for fiscal year 2014  as compared to fiscal year 2013  this increase is primarily due to our battlefield simcity fifa and crysis franchises partially offset by decreased revenue in our mass effect fifa street the sims and medal of honor franchises   during fiscal year 2014  

supplemental net revenue by revenue composition 

as we continue to evolve our business and more of our products are delivered to consumers digitally via the internet we place a greater emphasis and focus on assessing our business through a review of net revenue by revenue composition 

net revenue before revenue deferral a nongaap financial measure is provided in this section of mda including a discussion of the components of this measure 1 packaged goods and other 2 digital and 3 distribution see “nongaap financial measures” below for an explanation of our use of this nongaap financial measure a reconciliation to the corresponding measure calculated in accordance with us gaap is provided in the discussion below 

“revenue deferral” in this “net revenue” section generally includes the unrecognized revenue from bundled sales of certain onlineenabled games for which we do not have vsoe for the unspecified updates fluctuations in the revenue deferral are largely dependent upon the amounts of products that we sell with the online features and services previously discussed while the recognition of revenue deferral for a period is also dependent upon 1 the amount deferred 2 the period of time the softwarerelated offerings are to be provided and 3 the timing of the sale for example most revenue deferrals incurred in the first quarter of a fiscal year are recognized within the same fiscal year however substantially all of the revenue deferrals incurred in the last month of a fiscal year will be recognized in the subsequent fiscal year 

our total net revenue by revenue composition for fiscal years 2014 and 2013  was as follows in millions 



net revenue before revenue deferral 

packaged goods and other revenue 

packaged goods revenue previously disclosed as “publishing revenue” includes sales of software that is distributed physically this includes 1 sales of our internallydeveloped and copublished game software distributed physically through traditional channels such as brick and mortar retailers and 2 our software licensing revenue from third parties for example makers of personal computers or computer accessories who include certain of our products for sale with their products “oem bundles” other revenue includes our nonsoftware licensing revenue 

for fiscal year 2014  packaged goods and other net revenue before revenue deferral was 2149 million  primarily driven by fifa 14   battlefield 4 and madden nfl 25  packaged goods and other net revenue before revenue deferral for fiscal year 2014   increased   121 million  or 6 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2013  this increase was driven by a 652 million increase in sales primarily from the battlefield and fifa franchises and titanfall  this increase was partially offset by a 532 million decrease in sales primarily from the medal of honor the sims crysis and dead space franchises  

digital revenue 

digital revenue previously disclosed as “wireless internetderived and advertising digital revenue” includes sales of software distributed through direct download via the internet this includes internallydeveloped and copublished game software distributed through our directtoconsumer platform origin distributed wirelessly through mobile carriers or licensed to our thirdparty publishing partners who distribute our games digitally this includes our fullgame downloads mobile and tablet revenue each of which are generally classified as product revenue with the exception of our mmo game downloads and freemium mobile games which are classified as service revenue as well as subscription services microtransactions and advertising revenues each of which is generally classified as service and other revenue 

for fiscal year 2014  digital net revenue before revenue deferral was 1793 million  an increase of 130 million  or 8  as compared to fiscal year 2013  this increase is due to 1 a 297 million or 24 percent increase in fullgame download extra content and freetoplay sales primarily driven by fifa 14  battlefield 4  and fifa online 3 these increases were partially offset by a 167 million or 39 percent decrease in subscription sales primarily driven by battlefield 3   premium  subscription star wars the old republic and  fifa 13    in the previous year star wars the old republic  was a subscriptiononly based mmo this year some of the revenue from this title was recognized in the freetoplay category as we expanded this title to be both a subscription and freetoplay game 

distribution revenue 

for fiscal year 2014  distribution net revenue was 79 million  and decreased   23 million  or 23 percent  compared to fiscal year 2013  this decrease was primarily driven by decreases in sales from the secret world  and our switzerland distribution business 

revenue deferral 

revenue deferral for fiscal year 2014   increased   328 million  or 11 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2013  substantially all of this increase was due to a 251 million increase in net revenue before revenue deferral related to our packaged goods and other and digital sales during fiscal year 2014  as compared to fiscal year 2013  and a slightly higher percentage of both our packaged goods and other and digital sales being deferred and recognized over time 

recognition of revenue deferral 

the recognition of revenue deferral for fiscal year 2014  decreased 122 million  or 4 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2013  primarily due to the increase in our estimated offering period which commenced during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 for physical games sold through retail from six to nine months 

nongaap financial measures 

net revenue before revenue deferral is a nongaap financial measure that excludes the impact of revenue deferral and the recognition of revenue deferral on net revenue related to sales of games and digital content 

we believe that excluding the impact of revenue deferral and the recognition of revenue deferral related to games and digital content from our operating results is important to facilitate comparisons between periods in understanding our underlying sales performance for the period and understanding our operations because all related costs of revenues are expensed as incurred instead of deferred and recognized ratably we use this nongaap financial measure internally to evaluate our operating performance when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods and when assessing the performance of our management team while we believe that this nongaap financial measure is useful in evaluating our business this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap in addition this nongaap financial measure may not be the same as nongaap financial measures presented by other companies 

product revenue and service and other revenue by revenue composition 

our product and service and other revenue by revenue composition for fiscal years 2014 and 2013  was as follows in millions 



cost of revenue 

total cost of revenue for fiscal years 2014 and 2013  was as follows in millions 



cost of product revenue 

cost of product revenue consists of 1 product costs 2 certain royalty expenses for celebrities professional sports and other organizations and independent software developers 3 manufacturing royalties net of volume discounts and other vendor reimbursements 4 expenses for defective products 5 writeoffs of post launch prepaid royalty costs 6 amortization of certain intangible assets 7 personnelrelated costs and 8 warehousing and distribution costs we generally recognize volume discounts when they are earned from the manufacturer typically in connection with the achievement of unitbased milestones whereas other vendor reimbursements are generally recognized as the related revenue is recognized 

cost of product revenue decreased  by 53 million  or 49 percent  in fiscal year 2014  as compared to fiscal year 2013  the decrease was primarily due to intangible impairment charges incurred in fiscal year 2013 compared to an immaterial amount of such charges incurred during fiscal year 2014 and a decrease in royalty costs due to fewer royaltybearing products released   during fiscal year 2014  as compared to fiscal year 2013  

cost of service and other revenue 

cost of service and other revenue consists primarily of 1 data center and bandwidth costs associated with hosting our online games and websites 2 associated royalty costs 3 credit card fees associated with our service revenue 4 server costs related to our website advertising business and 5 platform processing fees from operating our websitebased games on third party platforms 

cost of service and other revenue increased by 12 million or 40 percent  in fiscal year 2014  as compared to fiscal year 2013  the increase was primarily due to an increase in product costs due to the release of titanfall  and an increase in royalty costs due to more royaltybearing services released during fiscal year 2014  as compared to fiscal year 2013  

total cost of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue 

total cost of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue remained relatively consistent during fiscal year 2014  as compared to fiscal year 2013  

research and development 

research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred by our production studios for personnelrelated costs related overhead costs contracted services depreciation and any impairment of prepaid royalties for prelaunch products research and development expenses for our online products include expenses incurred by our studios consisting of direct development and related overhead costs in connection with the development and production of our online games research and development expenses also include expenses associated with the development of network infrastructure software licenses and maintenance and management overhead 

research and development expenses for fiscal years 2014 and 2013  were as follows in millions 

research and development expenses decreased  by 28 million  or 2 percent  in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 this decrease was primarily due to a 49 million decrease in contracted services as a result of fewer titles released this fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year this was partially offset by a 25 million increase in facilityrelated costs related to higher rent and depreciation expenses 

marketing and sales 

marketing and sales expenses consist of personnelrelated costs related overhead costs advertising marketing and promotional expenses net of qualified advertising cost reimbursements from third parties 

marketing and sales expenses for fiscal years 2014 and 2013  were as follows in millions 

marketing and sales expenses decreased  by 108 million  or 14 percent  in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 the decrease was primarily due to 1 a 54 million decrease in personnelrelated costs resulting from a decrease in headcount 2 a 29 million decrease in advertising and promotional spending on our franchises as compared to the prior year and 3 a 24 million decrease in contracted services 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related expenses of executive and administrative staff corporate functions such as finance and human resources related overhead costs fees for professional services such as legal and accounting and allowances for doubtful accounts 

general and administrative expenses for fiscal years 2014 and 2013  were as follows in millions 

general and administrative expenses increased  by 56 million  or 16 percent  in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 the increase was primarily due to 1 a 30 million accrual related to the anticipated settlement of a litigation matter related to our college football franchise 2 an 18 million loss on a license related to our college football franchise and 3 a 13 million increase in incentivebased compensation expense this was partially offset by a 7 million decrease in facilityrelated costs 

acquisitionrelated contingent consideration 

acquisitionrelated contingent consideration for fiscal years 2014 and 2013  were as follows in millions 

during fiscal year 2014 acquisitionrelated contingent consideration credits decreased  by 29 million  or 45 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2013 primarily resulting from changes in our earnout estimates related to our popcap acquisition the popcap earnout expired on december 31 2013 no payments were made under this earnout 

amortization of intangibles 

amortization of intangibles for fiscal years 2014 and 2013  were as follows in millions 

amortization of intangibles decreased  by 14 million  or 47 percent  in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 primarily due to certain intangible assets from our acquisitions being fully amortized and impairment charges incurred during fiscal year 2013 

restructuring and other charges 

restructuring and other charges for fiscal years 2014 and 2013  were as follows in millions 

restructuring and other charges decreased  as compared to fiscal year 2013  as there were no new restructuring initiatives in fiscal year 2014 see the “liquidity and capital resources” section on page 46 for additional information regarding our previous restructuring plans 

interest and other income expense net 

interest and other income expense net for fiscal years 2014 and 2013  were as follows in millions 

interest and other income expense net remained relatively consistent as compared to fiscal year 2013  

income taxes 

provision for benefit from income taxes for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 was as follows in millions 

our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2014 was a tax benefit of 143 the fiscal year 2014 effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 350 percent as a result of the utilization of us deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance and tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and the resolution of examinations by taxing authorities 

our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2013 differs from the statutory rate of 350 percent primarily due to the us losses for which no benefit is recognized and nondeductible stockbased compensation offset by nonus profits subject to reduced or zero tax rates and the nontaxable change in the estimated fair value of acquisitionrelated contingent consideration 

our effective income tax rates for fiscal year 2015 and future periods will depend on a variety of factors including changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions changes in our international structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix of income changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in our annual pre 

tax income or loss we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our pretax consolidated income or loss as a result in absolute dollar terms our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pretax income or loss than at higher levels in addition at lower levels of pretax income or loss our effective tax rate will be more volatile 

certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law have not been considered as a source of future taxable income that is available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets 

the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the “act” was signed into law on january 2 2013 the act contains a number of provisions including most notably an extension of the research tax credit through december 31 2013 the act did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 due to the effect of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 

historically we have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly no us taxes have been provided thereon in connection with a review of our cash position including potential future cash needs for stock repurchases and debt retirement we made a onetime repatriation of 700 million from certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries during the three months ended march 31 2014 this repatriation did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 due to the deferred tax valuation allowance 

the remaining undistributed foreign earnings of approximately 150 million principally related to electronic arts canada will continue to be indefinitely reinvested going forward if these earnings were to be repatriated in the future they may be subject to additional us income taxes

in july 2013 the fasb issued asu 201311 income taxes topic 220 presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists  the amendments of this asu require that entities that have an unrecognized tax benefit and a net operating loss carryforward or similar tax loss or tax credit carryforward in the same jurisdiction as the uncertain tax position present the unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction of the deferred tax asset for the loss or tax credit carryforward rather than as a liability when the uncertain tax position would reduce the loss or tax credit carryforward under the tax law the disclosure requirements will be effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after december 15 2013 and will require prospective application early adoption is permitted the adoption will impact our balance sheet only and we expect to adopt this new standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 while we have not completed our analysis we anticipate the adoption will result in equal reductions to both deferred tax assets and noncurrent income tax obligations between 80 million  and 90 million

financing arrangement 

in july 2011 we issued 6325 million aggregate principal amount of 075 convertible senior notes due 2016 the “notes” the notes are senior unsecured obligations which pay interest semiannually in arrears at a rate of 075 percent per annum on january 15 and july 15 of each year beginning on january 15 2012 and will mature on july 15 2016 unless earlier purchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date the notes are convertible into cash and shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion value of 315075 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 3174 per share upon conversion of the notes holders will receive cash up to the principal amount of each note and any excess conversion value will be delivered in shares of our common stock we used the net proceeds of the notes to finance the cash consideration of our acquisition of popcap which closed in august 2011 

prior to april 15 2016 the notes will be convertible only upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods and thereafter at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the notes the notes do not contain any financial covenants 

the conversion rate is subject to customary antidilution adjustments but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest following certain corporate events described in the indenture governing the notes the “indenture” that occur prior to the maturity date the conversion rate will be increased for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such corporate event in certain circumstances the notes are not redeemable prior to maturity and no sinking fund is provided for the notes 

if we undergo a “fundamental change” as defined in the indenture subject to certain conditions holders may require us to purchase for cash all or any portion of their notes the fundamental change purchase price will be 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the fundamental change purchase date 

the indenture contains customary terms and covenants including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing either the trustee or the holders of at least 25 percent in principal amount of the outstanding notes may declare 100 percent of the principal and accrued and unpaid interest on all the notes to be due and payable 

in addition in july 2011 we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions the “convertible note hedge” with certain counterparties to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes the convertible note hedge subject to customary antidilution adjustments provides us with the option to acquire on a net settlement basis approximately 199 million shares of our common stock at a strike price of 3174 which corresponds to the conversion price of the notes and is equal to the number of shares of our common stock that notionally underlie the notes as of march 31 2014  we have not purchased any shares under the convertible note hedge we paid 107 million  for the convertible note hedge 

separately we have also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with certain counterparties whereby we sold to independent third parties warrants the “warrants” to acquire subject to customary antidilution adjustments that are substantially the same as the antidilution provisions contained in the notes up to 199 million shares of our common stock which is also equal to the number of shares of our common stock that notionally underlie the notes with a strike price of 4114 the warrants could have a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds 4114 on or prior to the expiration date of the warrants we received proceeds of 65 million from the sale of the warrants 

see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our 075 convertible senior notes due 2016 

credit facility 

on august 30 2012 we entered into a 500 million  senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks the credit facility terminates on february 29 2016 and contains an option to arrange with existing lenders andor new lenders for them to provide up to an aggregate of 250 million  in additional commitments for revolving loans proceeds of loans made under the credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes 

the loans bear interest at our option at the base rate plus an applicable spread or an adjusted libor rate plus an applicable spread in each case with such spread being determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding fiscal quarter we are also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for loans bearing interest at the base rate and at the end of an interest period or at each three month interval 

in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted libor rate principal together with all accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable on february 29 2016 

the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to among other things incur subsidiary indebtedness grant liens dispose of all or substantially all assets and pay dividends or make distributions in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type we are also required to maintain compliance with a capitalization ratio and maintain a minimum level of total liquidity and a minimum level of domestic liquidity 

the credit agreement contains customary events of default including among others nonpayment defaults covenant defaults bankruptcy and insolvency defaults and a change of control default in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type the occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the credit agreement an obligation by any guarantors to repay the obligations in full and an increase in the applicable interest rate 

as of march 31 2014  no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 

financial condition 

we believe that our cash cash equivalents shortterm investments cash generated from operations and available financing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next 12 months including working capital requirements capital expenditures and potentially future acquisitions stock repurchases or strategic investments we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position facilitate expansion repurchase our stock pursue strategic acquisitions and investments andor to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise there can be no assurance however that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms if at all or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 

as of march 31 2014  approximately 762 million of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions while we have no plans to repatriate these funds to the united states in the short term if we choose to do so we may be required to accrue and pay additional taxes on any portion of the repatriation where no united states income tax had been previously provided we made a onetime repatriation of 700 million  from certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries during the three months ended march 31 2014 this repatriation did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 due to the deferred tax valuation allowance 

in july 2012 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 500 million  of our common stock during fiscal year 2013  we repurchased and retired approximately 26 million  shares of our common stock for approximately 349 million  of which approximately 22 million shares or 278 million was repurchased under this program the remainder of the shares repurchased and retired during fiscal year 2013  were repurchased pursuant to a stock repurchase program approved by our board of directors in february 2011

we have a “shelf” registration statement on form s3 on file with the sec this shelf registration statement which includes a base prospectus allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus we would use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes including for working capital financing capital expenditures research and development marketing and distribution efforts and if opportunities arise for acquisitions or strategic alliances pending such uses we may invest the net proceeds in interestbearing securities in addition we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time

we are exposed to various market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market prices which have experienced significant volatility in light of the global economic downturn market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks foreign currency option and forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below while we do not hedge our shortterm investment portfolio we protect our shortterm investment portfolio against different market risks including interest rate risk as discussed below our cash and cash equivalents portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and do not hedge our market price risk relating to marketable equity securities if any 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

cash flow hedging activities  from time to time we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreigncurrencydenominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing foreign currency forward and option contracts that generally have maturities of 15 months or less these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges the derivative assets or liabilities associated with our hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current assets or accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity the gross amount of the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is subsequently reclassified into net revenue or research and development expenses as appropriate in the period 

when the forecasted transaction is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations in the event that the gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are deemed to be ineffective the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value if any is reclassified to interest and other income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur or it becomes remote that they will occur within the defined hedge period the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements in net revenue and research and development expenses total gross notional amounts and fair values for currency derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation are as follows 



the net impact of the effective portion of gains and losses from our cash flow hedging activities in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended march 31 2014 2013 and 2012  was a loss of 9 million  4 million  and 4 million  respectively during the fiscal years ended march 31 2014 2013 and 2012  we reclassified an immaterial amount of the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value into interest and other income expense net 

balance sheet hedging activities  we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily intercompany receivables and payables the foreign currency forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three months or less and are transacted near monthend our foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as other current assets or accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in interest and other income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations the gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities which are also reported in interest and other income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations in certain cases the amount of such gains and losses will significantly differ from the amount of gains and losses recognized on the underlying foreigncurrencydenominated monetary asset or liability in which case our results will be impacted total gross notional amounts and fair values for currency derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are accounted for as follows 



the effect of foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended march 31 2014 2013 and 2012  was a loss of 5 million a loss of 2 million and a gain of 21 million respectively 

we believe the counterparties to these foreign currency forward and option contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations as of march 31 2014  a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent  or 20 percent  would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value of the premiums on our foreign currency forward and option contracts used in cash flow hedging of 54 million  and 108 million  respectively as of march 31 2014  a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent  or 20 percent  would have resulted in potential losses on our foreign currency forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of 37 million  and 74 million  respectively this sensitivity analysis assumes an adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates however all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and actual results may differ materially 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities however because shortterm investments mature relatively quickly and are required to be reinvested at the thencurrent market rates interest income on a portfolio consisting of shortterm investments is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term investments additionally the contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to call prepay or otherwise settle the investments at prices less than the stated par value our investments are held for purposes other than trading also we do not use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio 

as of march 31 2014 and 2013  our shortterm investments were classified as availableforsale securities and consequently were recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in stockholders’ equity our portfolio of shortterm investments consisted of the following investment categories summarized by fair value as of march 31 2014 and 2013  in millions 

notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations at any time a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio the following table presents the hypothetical changes in the fair value of our shortterm investment portfolio as of march 31 2014  arising from potential changes in interest rates the modeling technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps

 item 1 business 

we develop market publish and distribute game software content and services that can be played by consumers on a variety of video game machines and electronic devices which we call “platforms” including 

 our strategy 

our business continues to transform historically we have derived most of our sales from diskbased video game products that are sold through retailers we call these “packaged goods” products now however the fastest growing part of our business is delivering games directly to consumers through online and wireless networks for example 

 at the same time we have aggressively reduced the number of significant titles releases that we launch each year in fiscal year 2009 we published over 60 packaged goods products each of which was primarily a standalone game with few or no online features and in each fiscal year since we have launched fewer titles on consoles while building additional online features content and services around each one of our titles in fiscal year 2013 we published 13 titles on video game consoles and pcs each with additional online features content andor services and we offered more than 22 titles for mobile and internet platforms to take advantage of the growth opportunities on those platforms 

brands 

our strategy is to develop our core intellectual properties which we call “brands” into yearround businesses available on a range of platforms we have created licensed and acquired a strong portfolio of brands which span a diverse range of categories including actionadventure casual family fantasy firstperson shooter horror science fiction roleplaying racing simulation sports and strategy our portfolio of brands includes whollyowned brands such as battlefield mass effect need for speed the sims bejeweled and plants v zombies our portfolio also includes brands based on licensed intellectual property including sportsbased brands such as madden nfl and fifa  

a cornerstone of our brand strategy is to publish products that can be iterated or sequeled and that can be integrated across multiple gameplaying devices for example a new edition of our most popular sports product fifa soccer is released each year for consoles pcs mobile phones and tablets 

platforms 

our ability to publish games across multiple platforms through multiple distribution channels and directly to consumers online and wirelessly has been and will continue to be another cornerstone of our business strategy technology advances continue to create new platforms and distribution opportunities for interactive entertainment and these technologies impact the way consumers play video games we expect that new platforms will continue to grow the consumer base for our products while also providing competition for established video game platforms both microsoft and sony have announced their plans to release new video game console systems in 2013 in november 2012 nintendo released its wiiu which succeeded the wii ea is investing in products and services for these nextgeneration consoles in the near term we expect to continue to develop and market products and services for currentgeneration consoles including the xbox 360 and playstation 3 while also developing products and services for nextgeneration console systems the success of our products and services for these nextgeneration consoles depends in part on the commercial success and adequate supply of these new consoles our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be successful in the marketplace and our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for these platforms 

further we are investing significantly in our own distribution platform which consumers are already using to purchase and play games directly from us through online portals such as origin we are acquiring consumers of our games and game services directly and establishing ongoing relationships with them through these relationships we are engaging them in their favorite brands across a number of devices allowing them to communicate with their friends and inviting them to try our other game experiences we have generated substantial growth in new business models and alternative revenue streams such as subscription microtransactions and advertising based on the continued expansion of our online and wireless platforms 

significant business developments in fiscal year 2013 

digital content distribution and services  consumers are spending an everincreasing portion of their money and time on interactive entertainment that is accessible online or through mobile digital devices such as smart phones or through social networks such as facebook we provide a variety of onlinedelivered products and services including through our origin platform many of our games that are available as packaged goods products are also available through direct online download via the internet we also offer onlinedelivered content and services that are addons or related to our packaged goods products such as additional game content or enhancements of multiplayer services further we provide other games content and services that are available only via electronic delivery such as internetonly games and game services and games for mobile devices 

wireless and internet platforms casual and mobile games  advances in technology have resulted in a variety of platforms for interactive entertainment examples include wireless technologies streaming game services and internetbased platforms these technologies services and platforms grow the consumer base for our business and have led to the growth of casual and mobile gaming casual and mobile games are characterized by their mass appeal simple controls flexible monetization including freetoplay and microtransaction business models and fun and approachable gameplay these games appeal to a larger consumer demographic  including younger and older players and more female players  than video games played on console devices we expect sales of casual and mobile games for wireless and other emerging platforms to continue to be an important part of our business

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs our business and financial performance could be harmed our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may harm our business and financial performance 

our business is intensely competitive and “hit” driven if we do not deliver “hit” products and services or if consumers prefer our competitors’ products or services over   our own our operating results could suffer 

competition in our industry is intense and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge throughout the world our competitors range from large established companies to emerging startups in our industry though many new products and services are regularly introduced only a relatively small number of “hit” titles accounts for a significant portion of total revenue for the industry we have significantly reduced the number of games that we develop publish and distribute in fiscal year 2011 we published 36 primary packaged goods titles and in fiscal year 2014 we expect to release 11 major titles and plan to build additional online features content and services around these titles publishing fewer titles means that we concentrate more of our development spending on each title and driving “hit” titles often requires large marketing budgets and media spend the underperformance of a title may have a large adverse impact on our financial results also hit products or services offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause revenue generated from our products and services to fall below expectations 

in addition both the online and mobile games marketplaces are characterized by frequent product introductions relatively low barriers to entry and new and evolving business methods technologies and platforms for development we expect competition in these markets to intensify if our competitors develop and market more successful products or services offer competitive products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering a better value proposition such as freetoplay or subscriptionbased models or if we do not continue to develop consistently highquality and wellreceived products and services our revenue margins and profitability will decline 

our operating   results will be adversely affected   if we do not consistently meet our product development schedules or if key events or sports seasons that we tie our product release schedules to are delayed or cancelled 

our business is highly seasonal with the highest levels of consumer demand and a significant percentage of our sales occurring in the holiday quarter ending in december and a seasonal low in sales volume in the quarter ending in june if we miss these key selling periods for any reason including product delays product cancellations or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have developed products our sales will suffer disproportionately our ability to meet product development schedules is affected by a number of factors including the creative processes involved the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams required by the increasing complexity of our products and the platforms for which they are developed and the need to finetune our products prior to their release we have experienced development delays for our products in the past which caused us to push back or cancel release dates we also seek to release certain products in conjunction with specific events such as the beginning of a sports season or major sporting event or the release of a related movie if a key event or sports season to which our product release schedule is tied were to be delayed or cancelled our sales would also suffer disproportionately in the future any failure to meet anticipated production or release schedules would likely result in a delay of revenue andor possibly a significant shortfall in our revenue increase our development expense harm our profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different than anticipated 

our industry is cyclical driven by the periodic introduction of new video game hardware systems as consumers transition to new console platforms our operating results may be more volatile 

new video game hardware systems have historically been developed and released every few years which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well the current cycle began with microsofts launch of the xbox 360 in 2005 and continued in 2006 when sony and nintendo launched the playstation 3 and the wii respectively both microsoft and sony have announced their plans to release new video game console systems in 2013 in november 2012 nintendo released its wiiu which succeeded the wii recently we have seen a decline in the market for currentgeneration video game systems which we believe is being caused by consumers awaiting the availability of new console systems from sony and microsoft this decline in sales of currentgeneration video game systems has caused a corresponding decline in the sales of packaged goods video game software for those systems 

in the near term we expect to develop and market products and services for currentgeneration consoles including the xbox 360 and playstation 3 while also developing products and services for nextgeneration console systems we do not control the introduction of these new console systems nor can we predict with certainty the unit volumes of these new console systems that will be available at launch or the rate at which consumers will purchase these new console systems as a result our operating results during this transitional period may be more volatile and will be difficult to predict 

our business is dependent on the success and   availability of video game hardware systems manufactured by third parties as well as our ability to develop commercially   successful products and services for these systems 

the success of our business is driven in part by the commercial success and adequate supply of these video game systems personal computers and mobile phonesdevices manufactured by third parties which we refer to as “platforms” our success also depends on our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be successful in the marketplace and our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for these platforms we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of anticipated platform release dates a platform for which we are developing products and services may not succeed or may have a shorter life cycle than anticipated if consumer demand for the platforms for which we are developing products and services is lower than our expectations our revenue will suffer we may be unable to fully recover the investments we have made in developing our products and services and our financial performance will be harmed alternatively a platform for which we have not devoted significant resources could be more successful than we had initially anticipated causing us to miss out on meaningful revenue opportunities 

our adoption of new business models could fail to produce our desired financial returns 

we are actively seeking to monetize game properties through a variety of new platforms and business models including online distribution of full games and additional content freetoplay games supported by advertising andor microtransactions on social networking services and subscription services forecasting our revenues and profitability for these new business models is inherently uncertain and volatile our actual revenues and profits for these businesses may be significantly greater or less than our forecasts additionally these new business models could fail for one or more of our titles resulting in the loss of our investment in the development and infrastructure needed to support these new business models and the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from more successful businesses 

technology changes rapidly in our business and if we fail to anticipate or   successfully develop games for new platforms and services adopt new distribution technologies or methods or implement new technologies in our games the quality timeliness and   competitiveness of our products and services will suffer 

rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate sometimes years in advance which technologies we must implement and take advantage of in order to make our products and services competitive in the market we have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies technologies products and services such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the technology we choose to adopt and the platforms products and services that we pursue will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

our product development usually starts with particular platforms and distribution methods in mind and a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve we may not be able to achieve these goals or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly and effectively than we can in either case our products and services may be technologically inferior to our competitors’ less appealing to consumers or both if we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule of our products and services then we may delay their release until these technology goals can be achieved which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses alternatively we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies either to preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up with our competition which would increase our development expenses we may also miss opportunities to adopt technology or develop products and services for new platforms or services that become popular with consumers which could adversely affect our revenues it may take significant time and resources to shift our focus to such technologies or platforms putting us at a competitive disadvantage 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain adequate operational services security and supporting infrastructure   

as we increase our online products and services including our online commerce and content delivery system origin we expect to continue to invest in technology services hardware and software  including data centers network services storage and database technologies  to support existing services and to introduce new products and services including websites ecommerce 

capabilities online game communities and online game play services launching high profile games and services and creating the appropriate support for online business initiatives is expensive and complex and our execution could result in inefficiencies or operational failures and increased vulnerability to cyber attacks which in turn could result in the inability of consumers to use our products and services or otherwise diminish the quality of our products services and user experience cyber attacks could include denialofservice brute force or validation attacks impacting service availability and reliability the exploitation of software vulnerabilities in internet facing applications social engineering of system administrators tricking company employees into releasing control of their systems to a hacker the introduction of malware into our systems with a view to steal confidential or proprietary data or attempts to hijack consumer account information cyber attacks of increasing sophistication may be difficult to detect and could result in the theft of our intellectual property and consumer data including personally identifiable information operational failures or successful cyber attacks could result in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers advertisers and other business partners which could harm our business in addition we could be adversely impacted by outages and disruptions in the online platforms of our key business partners who offer our products and services 

our business could be adversely affected if our consumer protection and data privacy practices are not seen as adequate or there are breaches of our security measures or unintended disclosures of our consumer data 

there are several inherent risks to engaging in business online and directly with end consumers of our products and services as we conduct more transactions online directly with consumers we may be the victim of fraudulent transactions including credit card fraud which presents a risk to our revenues and potentially disrupts service to our consumers in addition we are collecting and storing more consumer information including personal information and credit card information we take measures to protect our consumer data from unauthorized access or disclosure however it is possible that our security controls over consumer data may not prevent the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information a security breach that leads to disclosure of consumer account information including personally identifiable information could harm our reputation compel us to comply with disparate breach notification laws in various jurisdictions and otherwise subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue a resulting perception that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could result in a loss of current or potential consumers and business partners for our online offerings that require the collection of consumer data our key business partners also face these same risks and any security breaches of their systems could adversely impact our ability to offer our products and services through their platforms resulting in a loss of meaningful revenues in addition the rate of privacy lawmaking is accelerating globally and the interpretation and application of consumer protection and data privacy laws in the united states europe and elsewhere are often uncertain contradictory and in flux as business practices are being challenged by regulators private litigants and consumer protection agencies around the world it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data andor consumer protection practices if so this could result in increased litigation government or courtimposed fines judgments or orders requiring that we change our practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

if we release defective products or services our operating results could suffer 

products and services such as ours are extremely complex software programs and are difficult to develop and distribute we have quality controls in place to detect defects in our products and services before they are released nonetheless these quality controls are subject to human error overriding and reasonable resource constraints therefore these quality controls and preventative measures may not be effective in detecting defects in our products and services before they have been released into the marketplace in such an event we could be required to or may find it necessary to voluntarily recall a product or suspend the availability of the product or service which could significantly harm our business and operating results 

our business is subject to increasing regulation and the adoption of proposed legislation we oppose could negatively impact our business 

legislation is continually being introduced in the united states and other countries to mandate rating requirements or set other restrictions on the advertisement or distribution of entertainment software based on content in the united states most courts including the united states supreme court that have ruled on such legislation have ruled in a manner favorable to the interactive entertainment industry some foreign countries have adopted ratings regulations and certain countries allow government censorship of entertainment software products adoption of government ratings system or restrictions on distribution of entertainment software based on content could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers and compliance with new and possibly inconsistent regulations for different territories could be costly or delay the release of our products 

as we increase the online delivery of our products and services we are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet in addition laws and regulations relating to user privacy data collection and retention content advertising and information security have been adopted or are being considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation furthermore any failure on our part to comply with these laws or the application of these laws in an unanticipated manner may harm our business 

if we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel we will be unable to   effectively conduct our business 

the market for technical creative marketing and other personnel essential to the development and marketing of our products and management of our businesses is extremely competitive our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of executives and key creative talent if we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need or replace key employees following their departure our ability to develop and manage our business will be impaired 

if our marketing and advertising efforts fail to resonate with our customers our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs such as television and online advertising print advertising retail merchandising website development and event sponsorship our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part upon the success of these programs if the marketing for our products and services fail to resonate with our customers particularly during the critical holiday season or during other key selling periods or if advertising rates or other media placement costs increase these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

the majority of our sales are made to a relatively small number of key   customers if these customers reduce their purchases of our products or become   unable to pay for them our business could be harmed 

during the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 approximately 61 percent of our north america sales were made to our top ten customers in europe our top ten customers accounted for approximately 30 percent of our sales in that territory during the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 worldwide we had direct sales to one customer gamestop corp which represented approximately 13 percent of total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 though our products are available to consumers through a variety of retailers and directly through us the concentration of our sales in one or a few large customers could lead to a shortterm disruption in our sales if one or more of these customers significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to carry our products and could make us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers became unable to pay for our products or declared bankruptcy additionally our receivables from these large customers increase significantly in the december quarter as they make purchases in anticipation of the holiday selling season having such a large portion of our total net revenue concentrated in a few customers could reduce our negotiating leverage with these customers if one or more of our key customers experience deterioration in their business or become unable to obtain sufficient financing to maintain their operations our business could be harmed 

our channel partners have significant influence over the products and services that we offer on their platforms 

  

our products and services are sold to customers primarily through retailers and online through our channel partners including sony microsoft nintendo apple google and facebook in many cases our channel partners set the rates that we must pay to provide our games and services through their online channels these partners also have retained the flexibility to change their fee structures or adopt different fee structures for their online channels which could adversely impact our costs profitability and margins 

outside of the financial arrangements our agreements with our channel partners typically give them significant control over other aspects of the distribution of our products and services that we develop for their platform for example our agreements with sony microsoft and nintendo typically give significant control to them over the approval manufacturing and distribution of our products and services which could in certain circumstances leave us unable to get our products and services approved manufactured and provided to customers currently a majority of our revenue is derived through sales on two hardware consoles that are wholly owned by others 60 61 and 57 of our sales were for products and services on sony’s playstation 3 and microsoft’s xbox 360 consoles combined for the years ended march 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively for our digital products and services delivered direct to consumers via digital channels such as sony’s playstation network microsoft’s xbox live marketplace apple’s app store the google play store and facebook the channel partner 

has policies and guidelines that control the promotion and distribution of these titles and the features and functionalities that we are permitted to offer through the channel 

in addition while we have negotiated agreements in place with our channel partners  these agreements reserve the right by our channel partners to determine and change unilaterally certain key terms and conditions including the ability to change their user and developer policies and guidelines which can negatively impact our business if our channel partners establish terms that restrict our offerings through their channels or significantly impact the financial terms on which these products or services are offered to our customers our business could be harmed 

acquisitions investments and other strategic transactions could result in   operating difficulties dilution to our investors and other negative   consequences 

we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into other strategic transactions including 1 acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets 2 minority investments in strategic partners and 3 investments in new interactive entertainment businesses  eg  online and mobile publishing platforms as part of our longterm business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment that we acquire unknown liabilities or that we experience difficulty in the integration of business systems and technologies the integration and retention of new employees or in the maintenance of key business and customer relationships of the businesses we acquire or diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses these events could harm our operating results or financial condition 

future acquisitions and investments could also involve the issuance of our equity and equitylinked securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses such as stockbased compensation any of the foregoing factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating performance that could have otherwise been achieved by us on a standalone basis our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

if we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to include intellectual property owned by others in our games or to maintain or acquire the rights to publish or distribute games developed by others we   will sell fewer hit titles and our revenue profitability and cash flows   will decline competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and   reduce our profitability 

many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our ea sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players’ associations similarly many other franchises are based on film and literary licenses and our hasbro products are based on a license for certain of hasbro’s toy and game properties competition for these licenses and rights is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses and rights or obtain additional licenses or rights with significant commercial value our revenues profitability and cash flows will decline significantly competition for these licenses may also drive up the advances guarantees and royalties that we must pay to licensors and developers which could significantly increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

our business is subject to risks generally associated with the entertainment industry any of which could significantly harm our operating results 

our business is subject to risks that are generally associated with the entertainment industry many of which are beyond our control these risks could negatively impact our operating results and include the popularity price and timing of our games and the platforms on which they are played economic conditions that adversely affect discretionary consumer spending changes in consumer demographics the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted 

we rely on business partners in many areas of our business and our business may be harmed if they are unable to honor their obligations to us 

we rely on various business partners including thirdparty service providers vendors licensing partners development partners and licensees among others in many areas of our business in many cases these third parties are given access to sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support to our teams these third parties may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it the failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies or the failure of the third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies could result in a disruption to our business operations further disruptions in the financial markets and economic downturns 

may adversely affect our business partners and they may not be able to continue honoring their obligations to us some of our business partners are highlyleveraged or small businesses that may be particularly vulnerable alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner or vendor if we lose one or more significant business partners our business could be harmed 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights which could harm our business   

from time to time third parties may assert claims against us relating to patents copyrights trademarks personal publicity rights or other intellectual property rights to technologies products or deliverypayment methods that are important to our business although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement for example we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from certain individuals and companies who have acquired patent portfolios for the sole purpose of asserting such claims against other companies in addition many of our products are highly realistic and feature materials that are based on real world examples which may be the subject of intellectual property infringement claims of others from time to time we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims existing or future infringement claims against us whether valid or not may be time consuming and expensive to defend such claims or litigations could require us to pay damages and other costs stop selling the affected products redesign those products to avoid infringement or obtain a license all of which could be costly and harm our business in addition many patents have been issued that may apply to potential new modes of delivering playing or monetizing game software products and services such as those that we produce or would like to offer in the future we may discover that future opportunities to provide new and innovative modes of game play and game delivery to consumers may be precluded by existing patents that we are unable to license on reasonable terms 

from time to time we may become involved in other legal proceedings which could   adversely affect us 

we are currently and from time to time in the future may become subject to legal proceedings claims litigation and government investigations or inquiries which could be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations in addition the outcome of any legal proceedings claims litigation investigations or inquiries may be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

our products are subject to the threat of piracy and unauthorized copying 

we take measures to protect our prerelease software and other confidential information from unauthorized access a security breach that results in the disclosure of prerelease software or other confidential assets could lead or contribute to piracy of our games or otherwise compromise our product plans 

further entertainment software piracy is a persistent problem in our industry the growth in peertopeer networks and other channels to download pirated copies of our products the increasing availability of broadband access to the internet and the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures used with our products all have contributed to an expansion in piracy though we take technical steps to make the unauthorized copying of our products more difficult as do the providers of the video game systems personal computers and mobile phonedevices on which our games are played these efforts may not be successful in controlling the piracy of our products 

while legal protections exist to combat piracy and other forms of unauthorized copying preventing and curbing infringement through enforcement of our intellectual property rights may be difficult costly and time consuming particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights further the scope of the legal protection of copyright and prohibitions against the circumvention of technological protection measures to protect copyrighted works are often under scrutiny by courts and governing bodies the repeal or weakening of laws intended to combat piracy protect intellectual property and prohibit the circumvention of technological protection measures could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect against piracy these factors could have a negative effect on our growth and profitability in the future 

our business is subject to currency fluctuations   

international sales are a fundamental part of our business for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 international net revenue comprised 55 percent of our total net revenue we expect international sales to continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue such sales may be subject to unexpected regulatory requirements tariffs and other barriers additionally foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies which may fluctuate against the us dollar in addition our foreign investments and our cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies are subject to currency fluctuations we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate some foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated 

monetary assets and liabilities primarily certain intercompany receivables and payables to a limited extent and foreign currency option contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions primarily related to a portion of the revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currency generated by our operational subsidiaries however these activities are limited in the protection they provide us from foreign currency fluctuations and can themselves result in losses in the past the disruption in the global financial markets has impacted many of the financial institutions with which we do business and we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to such institutions with whom we enter into hedging transactions a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of the disruption in the financial markets could negatively impact our treasury operations including our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs accordingly our results of operations including our reported net revenue operating expenses and net income and financial condition can be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations especially the euro british pound sterling and canadian dollar 

we utilize debt financing and such indebtedness could adversely impact our business and financial condition 

in july 2011 we issued 6325 million aggregate principal amount of 075 convertible senior notes due 2016 the “notes” resulting in debt service obligations on the notes of approximately 5 million per year in addition in august 2012 we entered into an unsecured committed 500 million revolving credit facility while the facility is currently undrawn we may use the proceeds of any future borrowings for general corporate purposes the credit facility contains affirmative negative and financial covenants including a maximum capitalization ratio and minimum liquidity requirements 

we intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash generated by our operations and from our existing cash and investments we may enter into other financial instruments in the future 

our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for example it could 

 

we may not have enough available cash or be able to arrange for financing to pay such principal amount at the time we are required to make purchases of the notes or convert the notes in addition we may be required to use funds that are domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions in order to make the cash payments upon any purchase or conversion of the notes if we were to choose to use such funds we would be required to accrue and pay additional taxes on any portion of the repatriation where no united states income tax had been previously provided 

the hedge transactions and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the notes may affect the value of the notes and our common stock 

in connection with the offering of the notes we entered into privatelynegotiated convertible note hedge transactions the “convertible note hedge” with certain counterparties “options counterparties” to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes the convertible note hedge covers subject to antidilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the notes the number of shares of common stock underlying the notes we also entered into separate privatelynegotiated warrant transactions with the certain counterparties whereby we sold to independent third parties warrants the “warrants” with the option counterparties relating to the same number of shares of our common stock subject to customary antidilution adjustments 

the effect if any of these activities including the direction or magnitude on the market price of our common stock will depend on a variety of factors including market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities could however adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes 

in addition the option counterparties are financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that one or more of the option counterparties might default under the convertible note hedge our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral if any of the option counterparties becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under 

the convertible note hedge with such option counterparty our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 

we are also required to estimate what our tax obligations will be in the future although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the estimation process and applicable laws are inherently uncertain and our estimates are not binding on tax authorities the tax laws’ treatment of software and internetbased transactions is particularly uncertain and in some cases currently applicable tax laws are illsuited to address these kinds of transactions apart from an adverse resolution of these uncertainties our effective tax rate also could be adversely affected by our profit levels by changes in our business or changes in our structure resulting from the reorganization of our business and operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the elections we make changes in applicable tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions or changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as well as other factors beginning in fiscal year 2009 we recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggest that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized further our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should our ultimate tax liability exceed our estimates our income tax provision and net income or loss could be materially affected 

we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our consolidated pretax income or loss as a result in absolute dollar terms our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pretax income or loss than at higher levels in addition at lower levels of pretax income or loss our effective tax rate will be more volatile 

we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under examination by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations changes in our business or changes in applicable tax rules will not have an adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition 

furthermore as we expand our international operations adopt new products and new distribution models implement changes to our operating structure or undertake intercompany transactions in light of changing tax laws expiring rulings acquisitions and our current and anticipated business and operational requirements our tax expense could increase 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in   financial accounting standards 

our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting standards promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies for example accounting standards affecting software revenue recognition have affected and could continue to significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products and services we recognize all of the revenue from bundled sales  ie  onlineenabled games that include updates on a whenandifavailable basis or a matchmaking service on a deferred basis over an estimated offering period the financial accounting standards board “fasb” is currently evaluating the accounting and financial reporting for revenue transactions we believe the current proposal by the fasb would require us to materially change the way we account for revenue by requiring us to recognize more revenue upon delivery of the primary product than we currently do under current accounting standards 

as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue and taxes could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly   

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors above as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts’ earnings 

estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts’ and investors’ expectations to factors affecting the entertainment computer software internet media or electronics industries to our ability to successfully integrate any acquisitions we may make or to national or international economic conditions in particular economic downturns may contribute to the public stock markets experiencing extreme price and trading volume volatility these broad market fluctuations have and could continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

in july 2012 we announced that our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 500 million of our common stock our stock repurchases may be executed at market prices that may subsequently decline

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in june 2008 geoffrey pecover filed an antitrust class action in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging that ea obtained an illegal monopoly in a discreet antitrust market that consists of “leaguebranded football simulation video games” by bidding for and winning exclusive licenses with the nfl collegiate licensing company and arena football league in december 2010 the district court granted the plaintiffs request to certify a class of plaintiffs consisting of all consumers who purchased eas madden nfl ncaa football or arena football video games after 2005 in may 2012 the parties reached a settlement in principle to resolve all claims related to this action as a result we recognized a 27 million accrual for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 associated with the potential settlement in july 2012 the plaintiffs filed a motion with the court to approve the settlement on october 5 2012 the court granted its preliminary approval of the settlement and held a hearing to consider the courts final approval of the settlement for february 7 2013 as of the date of this filing the court has not issued an order granting its final approval of the settlement although the company expects that the court will do so 

in march 2011 robin antonick filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging that he wrote the source code for the original john madden football game published by ea in 1988 and that ea used certain parts of that source code in later editions in the madden franchise without compensating him mr antonick seeks compensatory damages in the amount of almost 6 million plus approximately 10 million  in prejudgment interest in addition to punitive damages and disgorgement of profits we believe that there is no merit to mr antonicks claims we further believe the likelihood of a judgment against us that includes punitive damages or the disgorgement of profits is very remote the trial is scheduled to begin on june 17 2013 

we are also subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we do not believe that any liability from any reasonably foreseeable disposition of such claims and litigation individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this report

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following overview is a highlevel discussion of our operating results as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers is important in order to understand our results for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form 10k including in the “business” section and the “risk factors” above the remainder of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” or the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

about electronic arts 

we develop market publish and distribute game software content and services that can be played by consumers on a variety of platforms including video game consoles such as the sony playstation 3 microsoft xbox 360 and nintendo wiiu personal computers mobile devices such as the apple iphone and google android compatible phones tablets and electronic readers such as the apple ipad and amazon kindle and the internet our ability to publish games across multiple platforms through multiple distribution channels and directly to consumers online and wirelessly has been and will continue to be a cornerstone of our product strategy we have generated substantial growth in new business models and alternative revenue streams such as subscription microtransactions and advertising based on the continued expansion of our online and wireless product and service offerings some of our games are based on our whollyowned intellectual property  eg  battlefield mass effect need for speed the sims bejeweled and plants v zombies and some of our games are based on content that we license from others  eg  fifa and madden nfl our goal is to turn our core intellectual properties into yearround businesses available on a range of platforms our products and services may be purchased through physical and online retailers platform providers such as console manufacturers and mobile carriers via digital downloads as well as directly through our own distribution platform including online portals such as origin 

financial results 

total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 was 3797 million down 346 million as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 at march 31 2013 deferred net revenue associated with sales of onlineenabled games decreased by 4 million as compared to march 31 2012 directly increasing the amount of reported net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 at march 31 2012 deferred net revenue associated with sales of onlineenabled games increased by 43 million as compared to march 31 2011 directly reducing the amount of reported net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 without these changes in deferred net revenue reported net revenue would have decreased by approximately 393 million during fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 net revenue for fiscal year 2013 was driven by fifa 13 battlefield 3  and fifa 12  

net income for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 was 98 million as compared to a net income of 76 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 was 031 as compared to a diluted earnings per share of 023 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 net income increased for fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 primarily as a result of 1 a 39 million gain on strategic investment from the sale of our investment in neowiz and 2 a 222 million decrease in operating expenses the increase in net income was partially offset by 1 a 136 million decrease in gross profit due to an 8 percent decrease in net revenue and 2 a 99 million increase in the provision for income taxes 

trends in our business 

nextgeneration console systems  both microsoft and sony have announced their plans to release new video game console systems in 2013 in addition in november 2012 nintendo released its wiiu which succeeded the wii ea is investing in products and services for these nextgeneration consoles in the near term we expect to continue to develop and market products and services for currentgeneration consoles including the xbox 360 and playstation 3 while also developing products and services for nextgeneration console systems the success of our products and services for these next generation consoles depends in part on the commercial success and adequate supply of these new consoles our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be successful in the marketplace and our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for these platforms 

digital content distribution and services  consumers are spending an everincreasing portion of their money and time on interactive entertainment that is accessible online or through mobile digital devices such as smart phones or through social networks such as facebook we provide a variety of onlinedelivered products and services including those available through our origin platform many of our games that are available as packaged goods products are also available through direct online 

download via the internet we also offer onlinedelivered content and services that are addons or related to our packaged goods products such as additional game content or enhancements of multiplayer services further we provide other games content and services that are available only via electronic delivery such as internetonly games and game services and games for mobile devices 

we significantly increased the revenue that we derive from wireless internetderived and advertising digital products and services from 1159 million in fiscal year 2012 to 1440 million in fiscal year 2013 and we expect this portion of our business to continue to grow in fiscal 2014 and beyond 

wireless and internet platforms casual and mobile games  advances in technology have resulted in a variety of platforms for interactive entertainment examples include wireless technologies streaming game services and internetbased platforms these technologies services and platforms grow the consumer base for our business and have led to the growth of casual and mobile gaming casual and mobile games are characterized by their mass appeal simple controls flexible monetization including freetoplay and microtransaction business models and fun and approachable gameplay these games appeal to a larger consumer demographic  including younger and older players and more female players  than video games played on console devices we expect sales of casual and mobile games for wireless and other emerging platforms to continue to be an important part of our business 

concentration of sales among the most popular games  we see a larger portion of packaged goods games sales concentrated on the most popular titles and those titles are typically sequels of prior games we have responded to this trend by significantly reducing the number of games that we produce to provide greater focus on our most promising intellectual properties we published 36 primary packaged goods titles in fiscal year 2011 22 in fiscal year 2012 13 in fiscal year 2013 and in fiscal year 2014 we expect to release 11 major titles 

evolving sales patterns  our business has evolved from a traditional packaged goods business model to one where our games are played on a variety of platforms including mobile devices and social networking sites our strategy is to transform our core intellectual properties into yearround businesses with a steady flow of downloadable content and extensions on new platforms our increasingly digital multiplatform business no longer reflects the retail sales patterns associated with traditional packaged goods launches for example we offer our consumers additional services andor additional content available through online services to further enhance the gaming experience and extend the time that consumers play our games after their initial purchase our casual and mobile games offer freetoplay and microtransaction models the revenue we derive from these services has become increasingly more significant yearoveryear our service revenue represented 24 percent 13 percent and 8 percent of total net revenue in fiscal year 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

recent developments 

stock repurchase program in july 2012 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 500 million of our common stock under this program we may purchase stock in the open market or through privatelynegotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws including pursuant to prearranged stock trading plans the timing and actual amount of the stock repurchases will depend on several factors including price capital availability regulatory requirements alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions we are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares under this program and it may be modified suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal year 2013  we repurchased and retired approximately 22 million  shares of our common stock for approximately 278 million  under this new program 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ”us gaap” the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities contingent assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown as a result actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

revenue recognition sales returns and allowances and bad debt reserves 

we derive revenue principally from sales of interactive software games and related content and services on 1 video game consoles such as the playstation 3 xbox 360 and wiiu and pcs 2 mobile devices such as the apple iphone and google android compatible phones and 3 tablets and electronic readers such as the apple ipad and amazon kindle we evaluate revenue recognition based on the criteria set forth in fasb accounting standards codification “asc” 605 revenue recognition and asc 985605 software revenue recognition  we classify our revenue as either product revenue or service and other revenue 

product revenue  our product revenue includes revenue associated with the sale of software games or related content whether delivered via a physical disc  e  g  packaged goods or via the internet  eg  fullgame downloads microtransactions and licensing of game software to thirdparties product revenue also includes revenue from mobile full game downloads that do not require our hosting support and sales of tangible products such as hardware peripherals or collectors’ items 

service and other revenue  our service revenue includes revenue recognized from timebased subscriptions and games or related content that requires our hosting support in order to utilize the game or related content  ie  cannot be played without an internet connection this includes 1 entitlements to content that are accessed through hosting services  eg  microtransactions for internetbased social network and mobile games 2 massively multiplayer online “mmo” games both software game and subscription sales 3 subscriptions for our pogobranded online game services and 4 allocated service revenue from sales of software games with an online service element  ie “matchmaking” service our other revenue includes advertising and nonsoftware licensing revenue 

with respect to the allocated service revenue from sales of software games with a matchmaking service mentioned above our allocation of proceeds between product and service revenue for presentation purposes is based on management’s best estimate of the selling price of the matchmaking service with the residual value allocated to product revenue our estimate of the selling price of the matchmaking service is comprised of several factors including but not limited to prior selling prices for the matchmaking service prices charged separately by other thirdparty vendors for similar service offerings and a costplusmargin approach we review the estimated selling price of the online matchmaking service on a regular basis and use this methodology consistently to allocate revenue between product and service for software game sales with a matchmaking service 

we evaluate and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met 

 

 

 

 

onlineenabled games 

the majority of our software games can be connected to the internet whereby a consumer may be able to download unspecified content or updates on a whenandifavailable basis “unspecified updates” for use with the original game software in addition we may also offer an online matchmaking service that permits consumers to play against each other via the internet without a separate fee us gaap requires us to account for the consumer’s right to receive unspecified updates or the matchmaking service for no additional fee as a “bundled” sale or multipleelement arrangement 

we have an established historical pattern of providing unspecified updates to onlineenabled software games  eg  player roster updates to madden nfl 13  at no additional charge to the consumer we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” for these unspecified updates and thus as required by us gaap we recognize revenue from the sale of 

these onlineenabled games over the period we expect to offer the unspecified updates to the consumer “estimated offering period” 

estimated offering period 

the offering period is not an explicitly defined period and thus we recognize revenue over an estimated offering period which is generally estimated to be six months beginning in the month after delivery 

determining the estimated offering period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage for example in determining the estimated offering period for unspecified updates associated with our onlineenabled games we consider the period of time consumers are online as online connectivity is required during the first quarter of each fiscal year we review consumers’ online gameplay of all onlineenabled games that have been released 12 to 24 months prior to the evaluation date for example if our evaluation date is april 1 2013 we evaluate all onlineenabled games released between april 1 2011 and march 31 2012 based on this population of games for all players that register the game online within the first six months of release of the game to the general public we compute the weightedaverage number of days for each onlineenabled game based on when a player initially registers the game online to when that player last plays the game online we then compute the weightedaverage number of days for all onlineenabled games by multiplying the weightedaverage number of days for each onlineenabled game by its relative percentage of total units sold from these onlineenabled games  ie  a game with more units sold will have a higher weighting to the overall computation than a game with fewer units sold under a similar computation we also consider the estimated period of time between the date a game unit is sold to a reseller and the date the reseller sells the game unit to an end consumer based on the sum of these two calculations we then consider the results from prior years known online gameplay trends as well as disclosed service periods for competitors’ games to determine the estimated offering period for future sales similar computations are also made for the estimated service period related to our mmo games which is generally estimated to be eighteen months we are currently evaluating our estimated offering period for fiscal 2014 

while we consistently apply this methodology inherent assumptions used in this methodology include which onlineenabled games to sample whether to use only units that have registered online whether to weight the number of days for each game whether to weight the days based on the units sold of each game determining the period of time between the date of sale to reseller and the date of sale to the consumer and assessing online gameplay trends 

other multipleelement arrangements 

in some of our multiple element arrangements we sell tangible products with software andor softwarerelated offerings these tangible products are generally either peripherals or ancillary collectors’ items such as figurines and comic books revenue for these arrangements is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each deliverable using the relative selling prices of each deliverable in the arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy described below if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable the arrangement consideration is allocated to the software deliverables as a group and then allocated to each software deliverable in accordance with asc 985605 

we determine the selling price for a tangible product deliverable based on the following selling price hierarchy vsoe  ie  the price we charge when the tangible product is sold separately if available thirdparty evidence “tpe” of fair value  ie  the price charged by others for similar tangible products if vsoe is not available or our best estimate of selling price “besp” if neither vsoe nor tpe is available determining the besp is a subjective process that is based on multiple factors including but not limited to recent selling prices and related discounts market conditions customer classes sales channels and other factors in accordance with asc 605 provided the other three revenue recognition criteria other than delivery have been met we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer as we have no further obligations 

we must make assumptions and judgments in order to 1 determine whether and when each element is delivered 2 determine whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element and 3 allocate the total price among the various elements as applicable changes to any of these assumptions and judgments or changes to the elements in the arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

sales returns and allowances and bad debt reserves 

we reduce revenue primarily for estimated future returns and price protection which may occur with our distributors and retailers “channel partners” price protection represents our practice to provide our channel partners with a credit allowance to lower their wholesale price on a particular product in the channel the amount of the price protection is generally the difference between the old wholesale price and the new reduced wholesale price in certain countries for our pc and console packaged 

goods software products we also have a practice of allowing channel partners to return older software products in the channel in exchange for a credit allowance as a general practice we do not give cash refunds 

when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances we analyze the following historical credit allowances current sellthrough of our channel partner’s inventory of our software products current trends in retail and the video game industry changes in customer demand acceptance of our software products and other related factors in addition we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection in subsequent periods 

in the future actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold software products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms product updates or competing software products while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters these estimates are inherently subjective accordingly if our estimates change our returns and price protection allowances would change and would impact the total net revenue accounts receivable and deferred net revenue that we report 

we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating the following customer creditworthiness current economic trends historical experience age of current accounts receivable balances changes in financial condition or payment terms of our customers significant management judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly as a result of a change in any of the evaluation factors mentioned above 

fair value estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item in order to fairly present our financial statements without an independent market or another representative transaction determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the accounting 

there are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value these include 1 the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value 2 the income approach which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example future cash flows or future earnings to a single present value amount and 3 the cost approach which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset for many of our fair value estimates including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets we use the income approach using the income approach requires the use of financial models which require us to make various estimates including but not limited to 1 the potential future cash flows for the asset or liability being measured 2 the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows 3 the time value of money associated with the expected receipt or payment of such cash flows and 4 the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium making these cash flow estimates is inherently difficult and subjective and if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate our financial results may be negatively impacted furthermore relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact to the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached for example a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired 

while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions the following areas are the most sensitive to these assessments 

business combinations    we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities and contingencies assumed acquired inprocess technology and contingent consideration issued in a business combination our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various estimated useful lives furthermore a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount we recognize as goodwill which is an asset that is not amortized determining the fair value of assets acquired requires an assessment of the highest and best use or the expected price to sell the asset and the related expected future cash flows determining the fair value of acquired inprocess technology also requires an assessment of our expectations related to the use of that asset determining the fair value of an assumed liability requires an assessment of the expected cost to transfer the liability determining the fair value of contingent consideration requires an assessment of the probabilityweighted expected future cash flows over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled and applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation the significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration payable are forecasted earnings significant changes in forecasted earnings 

would result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurement this fair value assessment is also required in periods subsequent to a business combination such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

assessment of impairment of goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets   current accounting standards require that we assess the recoverability of our finite lived acquisitionrelated intangible assets and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets is potentially impaired in order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred management must make various assumptions about the estimated fair value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated future cash flows for some assets our estimated fair value is dependent upon predicting which of our products will be successful this success is dependent upon several factors which are beyond our control such as which operating platforms will be successful in the marketplace also our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules 

in assessing impairment on our goodwill we first analyze qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the qualitative factors we assess include longterm prospects of our performance share price trends and company specific events if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount we do not need to perform the twostep impairment test if based on that assessment we believe it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value a twostep goodwill impairment test will be performed the first step measures for impairment by applying fair valuebased tests at the reporting unit level the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit reporting units are determined by the components of operating segments that constitute a business for which 1 discrete financial information is available and 2 segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount and as such we did not need to perform the twostep impairment test 

to determine the fair value of each reporting unit used in the first step we use the market approach which utilizes comparable companies’ data the income approach which utilizes discounted cash flows or a combination thereof determining whether an event or change in circumstances does or does not indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount is inherently subjective each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include longterm growth rates tax rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates based on a weighted average cost of capital future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables as of our last annual assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 we concluded that the estimated fair value of our reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying amount and we have not identified any indicators of impairment since that assessment our estimates for market growth our market share and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and certain external sources and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 

our business consists of developing marketing and distributing video game software using both established and emerging intellectual properties and our forecasts for emerging intellectual properties are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information and have an inherently higher risk of inaccuracy if future forecasts are revised they may indicate or require future impairment charges we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

  

royalties and licenses 

our royalty expenses consist of payments to 1 content licensors 2 independent software developers and 3 copublishing and distribution affiliates license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities professional sports organizations movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks copyrights personal publicity rights content andor other intellectual property royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games copublishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of products 

royaltybased obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid these royaltybased obligations are generally expensed to cost of revenue generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on the total projected net revenue for contracts with guaranteed minimums significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue it is inherently subjective as 

our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors including 1 the total number of titles subject to the contract 2 the timing of the release of these titles 3 the number of software units we expect to sell which can be impacted by a number of variables including product quality the timing of the title’s release and competition and 4 future pricing determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products furthermore if we conclude that we are unable to make a reasonably reliable forecast of projected net revenue we recognize royalty expense at the greater of contract rate or on a straightline basis over the term of the contract accordingly if our future revenue projections change our effective royalty rates would change which could impact the amount and timing of royalty expense we recognize 

prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and copublishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product and therefore we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product accordingly payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred payments due after completion of the product primarily royaltybased in nature are generally expensed as cost of revenue 

our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor when performance remains with the licensor we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract royalty liabilities are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next 12 months 

each quarter we also evaluate the expected future realization of our royaltybased assets as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales any impairments or losses determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense impairments or losses determined postlaunch are charged to cost of revenue we evaluate longlived royaltybased assets for impairment generally using undiscounted cash flows when impairment indicators exist unrecognized minimum royaltybased commitments are accounted for as executory contracts and therefore any losses on these commitments are recognized when the underlying intellectual property is abandoned  ie  cease use or the contractual rights to use the intellectual property are terminated 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carry forwards we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified it is generally difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is significant negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years forecasts of future taxable income are considered to be less objective than past results particularly in light of the economic environment therefore cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 

in addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities the carry back of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law and the implementation of tax planning strategies evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence this evaluation involves assumptions about future activity certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets 

based on the assumptions and requirements noted above we have recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets in addition we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability in the united states or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggest that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized 

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate these estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation as well as with respect to other matters such as anticipating the positions that we will 

take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities the ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations in addition changes in our business including acquisitions changes in our international corporate structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix and amount of income as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities valuation allowances applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate 

we historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly no us taxes have been provided thereon we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states

net revenue 

net revenue consists of sales generated from 1 video games sold as packaged goods or as digital downloads and designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation 3 xbox 360 and wiiu and pcs 2 video games for mobile devices such as the apple iphone and google android compatible phones 3 video games for tablets and electronic readers such as the apple ipad and amazon kindle 4 separate software products and content and online game services associated with these products 5 programming thirdparty websites with our game content 6 allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products and 7 advertisements on our online web pages and in our games 

we provide three different measures of our net revenue two of these measures are presented in accordance with us gaap    1 net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue and 2 net revenue by geography the third measure is a nongaap financial measure  net revenue before revenue deferral by revenue composition which is primarily based on method of distribution we use this third nongaap financial measure internally to evaluate our operating performance when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods and when assessing the performance of our management team 

management places a greater emphasis and focus on assessing our business through a review of the net revenue before revenue deferral by revenue composition than by net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue these two measures differ as 1 net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue reflects the deferral and recognition of revenue in periods subsequent to the date of sale due to us gaap while net revenue before revenue deferral by revenue composition does not and 2 both measures contain a different aggregation of sales from one another for instance service and other revenue does not include the majority of our fullgame digital download and mobile sales that are fully included in our digital revenue further service and other revenue includes all of our revenue associated with mmo games while software sales associated with our mmos are included in either digital revenue or publishing and other revenue depending on whether the sale was a fullgame digital download or a packaged goods sale

supplemental net revenue by revenue composition 

as we continue to evolve our business and more of our products are delivered to consumers digitally we place a greater emphasis and focus on assessing our business through a review of net revenue by revenue composition 

net revenue before revenue deferral a nongaap financial measure is provided in this section of mda including a discussion of the components of this measure 1 publishing and other 2 wireless internetderived and advertising digital and 3 distribution see “nongaap financial measures” below for an explanation of our use of this nongaap financial measure a reconciliation to the corresponding measure calculated in accordance with us gaap is provided in the discussion below 

“revenue deferral” in this “net revenue” section generally includes the unrecognized revenue from bundled sales of certain onlineenabled games for which we do not have vsoe for the unspecified updates fluctuations in the revenue deferral are largely dependent upon the amounts of products that we sell with the online features and services previously discussed while the recognition of revenue deferral for a period is also dependent upon 1 the amount deferred 2 the period of time the softwarerelated offerings are to be provided and 3 the timing of the sale for example most revenue deferrals incurred in the first half of a fiscal year are recognized within the same fiscal year however substantially all of the revenue deferrals incurred in the last month of a fiscal year will be recognized in the subsequent fiscal year 

our total net revenue by revenue composition for fiscal years 2013 and 2012  was as follows in millions 



net revenue before revenue deferral 

publishing and other revenue 

publishing and other revenue includes 1 sales of our internallydeveloped and copublished game software distributed physically through traditional channels such as brick and mortar retailers 2 our nonsoftware licensing revenue and 3 our software licensing revenue from third parties for example makers of personal computers or computer accessories who include certain of our products for sale with their products “oem bundles” 

for fiscal year 2013  publishing and other net revenue before revenue deferral was 2028 million  primarily driven by fifa 13  madden nfl 13    and  need for speed most wanted  publishing and other net revenue before revenue deferral for fiscal year 2013  decreased 708 million  or 26 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2012  this decrease was driven by a 1130 million decrease in sales primarily from the battlefield and mass effect franchises as well as star wars the old republic  this decrease was partially offset by a 422 million increase in sales primarily from the fifa medal of honor and dead space franchises 

wireless internetderived and advertising digital revenue 

digital revenue includes revenue from sales of our internallydeveloped and copublished game software distributed through direct download through the internet including through our directtoconsumer platform origin or distributed wirelessly through mobile carriers this includes our fullgame downloads mobile and tablet revenue each of which are generally classified as product revenue with the exception of our mmo game downloads and freemium mobile games which are classified as service revenue as well as subscription services microtransactions and advertising revenues each of which is generally classified as service and other revenue 

for fiscal year 2013  digital net revenue before deferral was 1663 million  an increase of 436 million  or 36 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2012  this increase is due to 1 a 221 million or 51 percent increase in extra content and freetoplay sales primarily driven by the fifa and bejeweled franchises along with star wars the old republic 2 a 136 million or 47 percent increase in subscription and advertising sales primarily driven by battlefield 3 premium  subscriptions  3 an 86 million or 30 percent increase in mobile sales primarily driven by the simpsons tapped out  and fifa world class soccer  these increases were partially offset by a 7 million or 3 percent decrease in fullgame download sales primarily driven by star wars the old republic and the battlefield franchise 

distribution revenue 

for fiscal year 2013  distribution net revenue was 102 million  and decreased 121 million  or 54 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2012  due to a decrease in sales primarily from the portal franchise and to a lesser extent our switzerland distribution business 

revenue deferral 

revenue deferral for fiscal year 2013  decreased 120 million  or 4 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2012  this decrease was primarily due to a 708 million decrease in net revenue before revenue deferral related to our publishing and other sales which was partially offset by a higher percentage of digital sales being deferred and recognized over time due in part to a 51 percent increase in extra content and freetoplay sales a 47 percent increase in subscription and advertising revenue a 30 percent increase in mobile sales all of which contain an online service component requiring revenue recognition over the period of time that the service is delivered 

recognition of revenue deferral 

our nondistribution sales are generally deferred and recognized over a weighted average sixmonth period and therefore the related revenue recognized in any fiscal year is primarily due to sales that occurred during the respective twelve months period ended december 31 the recognition of revenue deferral for fiscal year 2013  decreased 73 million  or 2 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2012  this decrease was primarily due to lower publishing sales during the twelve months ended december 31 2013 as compared to the same period in fiscal year 2012 

we anticipate that our fiscal year 2014 net revenue will be lower than our fiscal year 2013 net revenue as a result of a change in our estimated offering period partially offset by an increase in sales while we have not completed our evaluation of our estimated offering period for fiscal year 2014 we anticipate our weightedaverage estimated offering period for our products and services to be longer than our historical experience of generally six months as consumers are spending more time playing our games online we do not expect this change in estimated offering period to impact the amount of net revenue before revenue deferral or operating cash flows we report we expect net revenue to be up to 500 million lower than net revenue before deferral in fiscal year 2014 due primarily to the change in estimated offering period

nongaap financial measures 

net revenue before revenue deferral is a nongaap financial measure that excludes the impact of revenue deferral and the recognition of revenue deferral on net revenue related to sales of games and digital content 

we believe that excluding the impact of revenue deferral and the recognition of revenue deferral related to games and digital content from our operating results is important to facilitate comparisons between periods in understanding our underlying sales performance for the period and understanding our operations because all related costs of revenues are expensed as incurred instead of deferred and recognized ratably we use this nongaap financial measure internally to evaluate our operating performance when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods and when assessing the performance of our management team while we believe that this nongaap financial measure is useful in evaluating our business this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap in addition this nongaap financial measure may not be the same as nongaap financial measures presented by other companies

during fiscal year 2013 restructuring and other charges increased by 11 million  or 69 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2012 primarily due to 1 22 million in costs in connection with our fiscal 2013 restructuring which was initiated in this fiscal year and 2 a 10 million gain on the sale of our facility in chertsey england related to our fiscal 2008 reorganization that was recognized during fiscal year 2012 and for which there was no comparable gain in the current year these increases were partially offset by costs that were recognized during fiscal year 2012 comprised of 1 15 million expense adjustment for the amendment of certain licensing agreements related to our fiscal 2011 restructuring plan and 2 6 million in it and other costs to assist in reorganizing certain activities see the “liquidity and capital resources” section on page 45 for additional information regarding our restructuring plans

income taxes 

provision for benefit from income taxes for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 was as follows in millions 

our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2013 was a tax expense of 295 the fiscal year 2013 effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 350 percent primarily due to the us losses for which no benefit is recognized and nondeductible stockbased compensation offset by nonus profits subject to reduced or zero tax rates and the nontaxable change in the estimated fair value of acquisitionrelated contingent consideration 

our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2012 was a tax benefit of 3222 percent in fiscal year 2012 we recorded approximately 58 million of additional net deferred tax liabilities related to the popcap and klicknation corporation “klicknation” acquisitions these additional deferred tax liabilities create a new source of taxable income thereby requiring us to release a portion of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance with a related reduction in income tax expense of 58 million in addition during the three months ended march 31 2012 we recorded 48 million of additional tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations in nonus tax jurisdictions 

the fiscal year 2012 effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 350 percent as a result of the utilization of us deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance and nonus profits subject to a reduced or zero tax rate partially offset by nondeductible stockbased compensation in addition the fiscal year 2012 effective tax rate is impacted by tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and the resolution of examinations by taxing authorities as well as a reduction in the us valuation allowance related to the popcap and klicknation acquisitions 

our effective income tax rates for fiscal year 2014 and future periods will depend on a variety of factors including changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions changes in our international structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix of income changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in our annual pretax income or loss we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our pretax consolidated income or loss as a result in absolute dollar terms our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pretax income or loss than at higher levels in addition at lower levels of pretax income or loss our effective tax rate will be more volatile 

certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law have not been considered as a source of future taxable income that is available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets 

the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the “act” was signed into law on january 2 2013 the act contains a number of provisions including most notably an extension of the research tax credit through december 31 2013 the act did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 due to the effect of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 

we historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly no us taxes have been provided thereon we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states

during fiscal year 2012 total cost of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue decreased by 32 percent as compared to fiscal year 2011 this decrease as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to 1 a greater percentage of net revenue from our digital products that have a lower cost than our other products which positively impacted gross profit as a percentage of total revenue by approximately 35 percent and 2 a 196 million decrease in the change in deferred net revenue related to certain onlineenabled games for fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 which positively impacted gross profit as a percent of total net revenue by 22 percent these decreases are partially offset by 1 increased expenses related to our online and customer experience initiatives which negatively impacted gross profit as a percentage of total net revenue by 12 percent 2 an increase in amortization of our acquisitionrelated intangibles resulting mainly from the popcap acquisition in fiscal year 2012 which negatively impacted gross profit as a percentage of total net revenue by 09 percent and 3 an increase in sales of our distribution products which carry a higher royalty percentage than our other products which negatively impacted gross profit as a percentage of total net revenue by 09 percent

consistent with prior years the fiscal year 2012 effective tax rate continues to differ from the statutory rate of 350 percent as a result of the utilization of us deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance and nonus profits subject to a reduced or zero tax rate partially offset by nondeductible stockbased compensation in addition the fiscal year 2012 effective tax rate is impacted by tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and the resolution of examinations by taxing authorities as well as a reduction in the us valuation allowance related to the popcap and klicknation acquisitions in fiscal year 2011 the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 350 percent primarily due to us losses for which no benefit is recognized nonus losses with a reduced or zero tax benefit and nondeductible stockbased compensation expenses partially offset by tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of examination by taxing authorities 

impact of recently issued accounting standards

in february 2013 the fasb issued asu 201302 comprehensive income topic 220 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2012 the amendments of this asu require an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” by component in addition an entity is required to present either on the face of the statement where net income loss is presented or in the notes significant amounts reclassified out of aoci by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income an entity is required to crossreference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts we do not expect the adoption of asu 201302 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources   



changes in cash flow 

operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased 47 million  during the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 primarily due to 1 a decrease in prepaid royalty advances 2 a decrease in royalty payments and 3 a decrease in marketing and advertising spend as a result of a decrease in the number of titles released as compared to the prior year these decreases in cash outflows were offset by an increase in personnelrelated costs 

investing activities cash provided by investing activities increased 721 million  during the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 primarily driven by 1 a 666 million decrease in cash used for acquisitions the majority of which was used to fund our acquisition of popcap during the six months ended september 30 2011 2 proceeds of 72 million from the sale of our marketable equity securities 3 a decrease of 66 million in capital expenditures and 4 a 54 million decrease in the amount of shortterm investments purchased in fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 this was partially offset by a 67 million decrease in proceeds from maturities and sales of shortterm investments in fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 

financing activities cash used in financing activities increased 485 million  during the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 primarily due to 1 617 million in proceeds received from the sale of our 075 convertible senior notes due 2016 net of issuance costs that occurred in fiscal year 2012 2 65 million in proceeds received from the issuance of warrants in connection with the notes in the fiscal year 2012 and 3 a 23 million decrease in proceeds received from issuance of common stock in connection with our employee stock purchase plan during fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 this was partially offset by 1 a 122 million decrease in the repurchase and retirement of common stock during fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 and 2 107 million paid for the purchase of the convertible note hedge during fiscal year 2012 

shortterm investments and marketable equity securities 

due to our mix of fixed and variable rate securities our shortterm investment portfolio is susceptible to changes in shortterm interest rates as of march 31 2013 our shortterm investments had gross unrealized gains of 1 million or less than 1 percent of the total in shortterm investments and gross unrealized losses of less than 1 million or less than 1 percent of the total in shortterm investments from time to time we may liquidate some or all of our shortterm investments to fund operational needs or other activities such as capital expenditures business acquisitions or stock repurchase programs depending on which shortterm investments we liquidate to fund these activities we could recognize a portion or all of the gross unrealized gains or losses 

our marketable equity securities as of march 31 2012 consisted of common shares of neowiz the fair value of our marketable equity securities decreased by 119 million in fiscal year 2013 the decrease is attributed to the sale of our 

investment in neowiz during fiscal year 2013 we received proceeds of 72 million  and realized a gain of 39 million  net of costs to sell the realized gain is included in gains on strategic investments net in our consolidated statements of operations 

contingent consideration

fiscal 2013 restructuring 

on may 7 2012 we announced a restructuring plan to align our cost structure with our ongoing digital transformation under this plan we reduced our workforce terminated licensing agreements and consolidated or closed various facilities as of march 31 2013 we have completed all actions under this restructuring plan 

since the inception of the fiscal 2013 restructuring plan through march 31 2013 we have incurred charges of 22 million  consisting of 1 10 million  in employeerelated expenses 2 9 million  related to license termination costs and 3 3 million  related to the closure of certain of our facilities substantially all of these costs have been settled in cash as of march 31 2013 with the exception of approximately 3 million  of license and lease termination costs which will be settled by august 2016 we expect to incur cash expenditures through august 2016 of approximately 2 million through fiscal year 2015 and less than 1 million thereafter 

fiscal 2011 restructuring 

in connection with our fiscal 2011 restructuring plan we expect to incur cash expenditures through june 2016 of approximately 1 26 million in fiscal year 2014  2 18 million in fiscal year 2015  3 3 million in fiscal year 2016  and 4 18 million in fiscal year 2017 the actual cash expenditures are variable as they will be dependent upon the actual revenue we generate from certain games 

financing arrangement 

in july 2011 we issued 6325 million aggregate principal amount of 075 convertible senior notes due 2016 the “notes” the notes are senior unsecured obligations which pay interest semiannually in arrears at a rate of 075 percent per annum on january 15 and july 15 of each year beginning on january 15 2012 and will mature on july 15 2016 unless earlier purchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date the notes are convertible into cash and shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion value of 315075 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 3174 per share upon conversion of the notes holders will receive cash up to the principal amount of each note and any excess conversion value will be delivered in shares of our common stock we used the net proceeds of the notes to finance the cash consideration of our acquisition of popcap which closed in august 2011 

prior to april 15 2016 the notes will be convertible only upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods and thereafter at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the notes the notes do not contain any financial covenants 

the conversion rate is subject to customary antidilution adjustments but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest following certain corporate events described in the indenture governing the notes the “indenture” that occur prior to the maturity date the conversion rate will be increased for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such corporate event in certain circumstances the notes are not redeemable prior to maturity and no sinking fund is provided for the notes 

if we undergo a “fundamental change” as defined in the indenture subject to certain conditions holders may require us to purchase for cash all or any portion of their notes the fundamental change purchase price will be 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the fundamental change purchase date 

the indenture contains customary terms and covenants including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing either the trustee or the holders of at least 25 percent in principal amount of the outstanding notes may declare 100 percent of the principal and accrued and unpaid interest on all the notes to be due and payable 

in addition in july 2011 we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions the “convertible note hedge” with certain counterparties to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes the convertible note hedge subject to customary antidilution adjustments provide us with the option to acquire on a net settlement basis approximately 199 million shares of our common stock at a strike price of 3174 which corresponds to the conversion price of the notes and is equal to the number of shares of our common stock that notionally underlie the notes as of march 31 2013 we have not purchased any shares under the convertible note hedge we paid 107 million for the convertible note hedge 

separately we have also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the certain counterparties whereby we sold to independent third parties warrants the “warrants” to acquire subject to customary antidilution adjustments that are substantially the same as the antidilution provisions contained in the notes up to 199 million shares of our common stock which is also equal to the number of shares of our common stock that notionally underlie the notes with a strike price of 4114 the warrants could have a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of its common stock exceeds 4114 on or prior to the expiration date of the warrants we received proceeds of 65 million from the sale of the warrants 

see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our 075 convertible senior notes due 2016 

credit facility 

on august 30 2012  we entered into a 500 million  senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks the credit facility terminates on february 29 2016  and contains an option to arrange with existing lenders andor new lenders for them to provide up to an aggregate of 250 million  in additional commitments for revolving loans proceeds of loans made under the credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes 

the loans bear interest at our option at the base rate plus an applicable spread or an adjusted libor rate plus an applicable spread in each case with such spread being determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding fiscal quarter we are also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for loans bearing interest at the base rate and at the end of an interest period or at each three month interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted libor rate principal together with all accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable on february 29 2016  

the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to among other things incur subsidiary indebtedness grant liens dispose of all or substantially all assets and pay dividends or make distributions in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type we are also required to maintain compliance with a capitalization ratio and maintain a minimum level of total liquidity and a minimum level of domestic liquidity 

the credit agreement contains customary events of default including among others nonpayment defaults covenant defaults bankruptcy and insolvency defaults and a change of control default in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type the occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the credit agreement an obligation by any guarantors to repay the obligations in full and an increase in the applicable interest rate 

as of march 31 2013 no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 

financial condition 

we believe that our cash cash equivalents shortterm investments cash generated from operations and available financing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next 12 months including working capital requirements capital expenditures and potentially future acquisitions stock repurchases or strategic investments we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position facilitate expansion repurchase our stock pursue strategic acquisitions and investments andor to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise there can be no assurance however that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms if at all or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 

as of march 31 2013 approximately 993 million of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions while we have no plans to repatriate these funds to the united states in the short term if we choose to do so we would be required to accrue and pay additional taxes on any portion of the repatriation where no united states income tax had been previously provided 

in february 2011 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 600 million  of our common stock over the following 18 months  we completed our program in april 2012 we repurchased approximately 32 million  shares in the open market since under that program including pursuant to prearranged stock trading plans during fiscal years 2013 and 2012  we repurchased and retired approximately 4 million  and 25 million  shares of our common stock for approximately 71 million  and 471 million  respectively under that plan 

in july 2012 our board of directors authorized a new program to repurchase up to 500 million  of our common stock under this new program we may purchase stock in the open market or through privatelynegotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws including pursuant to prearranged stock trading plans the timing and actual amount of the stock repurchases will depend on several factors including price capital availability regulatory requirements alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions we are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares under this program and it may be modified suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal year 2013  we repurchased and retired approximately 22 million  shares of our common stock for approximately 278 million  under this new program 

during fiscal years 2013 and 2012  we repurchased and retired approximately 26 million  and 25 million  shares of our common stock for approximately 349 million  and 471 million  respectively for both plans 

we have a “shelf” registration statement on form s3 on file with the sec this shelf registration statement which includes a base prospectus allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus we would use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes including for working capital financing capital expenditures research and development marketing and distribution efforts and if opportunities arise for acquisitions or strategic alliances pending such uses we may invest the net proceeds in interestbearing securities in addition we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time 

our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those related to customer demand and acceptance of our products our ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due successfully achieving our product release schedules and attaining our forecasted sales objectives the impact of acquisitions and other strategic transactions in which we may engage the impact of competition economic conditions in the united states and abroad the seasonal and cyclical nature of our business and operating results risks of product returns and the other risks described in the “risk factors” section included in part i item 1a of this report 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

development celebrity league and content licenses payments and commitments 

the products we produce in our studios are designed and created by our employee designers artists software programmers and by nonemployee software developers “independent artists” or “thirdparty developers” we typically advance development funds to the independent artists and thirdparty developers during development of our games usually in installment payments made upon the completion of specified development milestones contractually these payments are generally considered advances against subsequent royalties on the sales of the products these terms are set forth in written agreements entered into with the independent artists and thirdparty developers 

in addition we have certain celebrity league and content license contracts that contain minimum guarantee payments and marketing commitments that may not be dependent on any deliverables celebrities and organizations with whom we have contracts include fifa fifpro foundation fapl football association premier league limited and dfl deutsche fußball liga gmbh german soccer league professional soccer national basketball association professional basketball pga tour tiger woods and augusta national professional golf national hockey league and nhl players’ association professional hockey national football league properties players inc and red bear inc professional football collegiate licensing company collegiate football zuffa llc ultimate fighting championship espn content in ea sports games hasbro inc most of hasbro’s toy and game intellectual properties and lucasarts and lucas licensing  star wars the old republic  these developer and content license commitments represent the sum of 1 the cash payments due under nonroyaltybearing licenses and services agreements and 2 the minimum guaranteed payments and advances against royalties due under royaltybearing licenses and services agreements the majority of which are conditional upon performance by the counterparty these minimum guarantee payments and any related marketing commitments are included in the table below 

the following table summarizes our minimum contractual obligations as of march 31 2013 and the effect we expect them to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions 

  

 subsequent to march 31 2013 we entered into various licensor and development agreements with third parties which contingently commits us to pay up to 163 million at various dates through fiscal year 2020 

the unrecognized amounts represented in the table above reflect our minimum cash obligations for the respective fiscal years but do not necessarily represent the periods in which they will be recognized and expensed in our consolidated financial statements in addition the amounts in the table above are presented based on the dates the amounts are contractually due as of march 31 2013  however certain payment obligations may be accelerated depending on the performance of our operating results 

in addition to what is included in the table above as of march 31 2013  we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling 260 million  of which approximately 46 million  is offset by prior cash deposits to tax authorities for issues pending resolution for the remaining liability we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 

also in addition to what is included in the table above as of march 31 2013  primarily in connection with our popcap klicknation and chillingo acquisitions we may be required to pay an additional 566 million  of cash consideration based upon the achievement of certain performance milestones through march 31 2015 as of march 31 2013  we have accrued 43 million  of contingent consideration on our consolidated balance sheet representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we have not paid any earnout to date for the popcap acquisition 

offbalance sheet commitments 

lease commitments 

as of march 31 2013 we leased certain of our current facilities furniture and equipment under noncancelable operating lease agreements we were required to pay property taxes insurance and normal maintenance costs for certain of these facilities and any increases over the base year of these expenses on the remainder of our facilities 

director indemnity agreements 

we entered into indemnification agreements with each of the members of our board of directors at the time they joined the board to indemnify them to the extent permitted by law against any and all liabilities costs expenses amounts paid in settlement and damages incurred by the directors as a result of any lawsuit or any judicial administrative or investigative proceeding in which the directors are sued or charged as a result of their service as members of our board of directors 

inflation 

we believe the impact of inflation on our results of operations has not been significant in any of the past three fiscal years 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market prices which have experienced significant volatility in light of the global economic downturn market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks foreign currency option and forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below while we do not hedge our shortterm investment portfolio we protect our shortterm investment portfolio against different market risks including interest rate risk as discussed below our cash and cash equivalents portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase we also do not currently hedge our market price risk relating to our marketable equity securities and we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

cash flow hedging activities  from time to time we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreigncurrencydenominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing foreign currency option contracts that generally have maturities of 12 months or less these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges the derivative assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity the gross amount of the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is subsequently reclassified into net revenue or research and development expenses as appropriate in the period when the forecasted transaction is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations in the event that the gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are deemed to be ineffective the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value if any is reclassified to interest and other income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur or it becomes remote that they will occur within the defined hedge period the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended march 31 2013 2012 and 2011 we reclassified an immaterial amount of losses into interest and other income expense net our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements in net revenue and research and development expenses as of march 31 2013  we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately 84 million  in foreign currency and to sell approximately 149 million  of foreign currency all of the foreign currency option contracts outstanding as of march 31 2013  will mature in the next 12 months as of march 31 2012  we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately 74 million  in foreign currency and to sell approximately 78 million  of foreign currencies as of march 31 2013  and 2012 these foreign currency option contracts outstanding had a total fair value of 6 million  and 2 million respectively and are included in other current assets 

balance sheet hedging activities  we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily intercompany receivables and payables the foreign currency forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three months or less and are transacted near monthend our foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as other current assets or accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in interest and other income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations the gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities which are also reported in interest and other income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations in certain cases the amount of such 

gains and losses will significantly differ from the amount of gains and losses recognized on the underlying foreigncurrencydenominated monetary asset or liability in which case our results will be impacted as of march 31 2013  we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell approximately 306 million  in foreign currencies of this amount 213 million  represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars 87 million  to purchase foreign currency in exchange for us dollars and 6 million  to sell foreign currency in exchange for british pound sterling as of march 31 2012  we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell approximately 242 million  in foreign currencies of this amount 197 million  represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars 37 million  to purchase foreign currency in exchange for us dollars and 8 million  to sell foreign currency in exchange for british pound sterling the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was immaterial as of march 31 2013 and 2012  

we believe the counterparties to these foreign currency forward and option contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of the disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations as of march 31 2013  a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 20 percent would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value of the premiums on our foreign currency option contracts used in cash flow hedging of 5 million and 6 million respectively as of march 31 2013 a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 20 percent would have resulted in potential losses on our foreign currency forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of 30 million and 61 million respectively this sensitivity analysis assumes an adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates however all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and actual results may differ materially 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities however because shortterm investments mature relatively quickly and are required to be reinvested at the thencurrent market rates interest income on a portfolio consisting of shortterm investments is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term investments additionally the contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to call prepay or otherwise settle the investments at prices less than the stated par value our investments are held for purposes other than trading also we do not use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio 

as of march 31 2013 and 2012  our shortterm investments were classified as availableforsale securities and consequently were recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in stockholders’ equity our portfolio of shortterm investments consisted of the following investment categories summarized by fair value as of march 31 2013 and 2012  in millions 

notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations at any time a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio the following table presents the hypothetical changes in the fair value in our shortterm investment portfolio as of march 31 2013  arising from potential changes in interest rates the modeling technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps

part iv 




 item 1 business tableend we develop market publish and distribute game software content and services that can be played by consumers on a variety of video game machines and electronic devices which we call “platforms” including 

 

  

  

  

  

 our strategy 

our business is rapidly transforming historically we have derived most of our sales from diskbased videogame products that are sold through retailers we call these “packaged goods” products now however the fastest growing part of our business is delivering games directly to consumers through online and wireless networks for example 

 

  

  

  

 at the same time we have aggressively reduced the number of significant titles releases that we launch each year in fiscal year 2009 we published over 60 packaged goods products each of which was primarily a standalone game with few or no online features and in each fiscal year since we have launched fewer titles on consoles while building additional online features content and services around each one of our titles this strategy has resulted in an increase in revenue per title and in our overall revenue yearoveryear on a nongaap basis in 

  

fiscal year 2013 we plan to offer only 14 titles on video game consoles and pcs each with additional online features content andor services and we plan to offer more than 40 titles for social mobile and play4free platforms to take advantage of the growth opportunities on those platforms 

brands 

our strategy is to turn our core intellectual properties which we call “brands” into yearround businesses available on a range of platforms we have created licensed and acquired a strong portfolio of brands which span a diverse range of categories including actionadventure casual family fantasy firstperson shooter horror science fiction roleplaying racing simulation social sports and strategy our portfolio of brands includes whollyowned brands such as battlefield mass effect need for speed the sims bejeweled and plants v zombies our portfolio also includes brands based on licensed intellectual property including sportsbased brands such as madden nfl and fifa and titles based on other popular brands such as star wars the old republic 

a cornerstone of our brand strategy is to publish products that can be iterated or sequeled and that can be integrated across multiple gameplaying devices for example a new edition of our most popular sports product fifa soccer is released each year for consoles pcs mobile phones tablets and facebook other products such as the sims and battlefield are sequeled on a lessfrequent basis 

platforms 

our ability to publish games across multiple platforms through multiple distribution channels and directly to consumers online and wirelessly has been and will continue to be another cornerstone of our business strategy technology advances continue to create new platforms and distribution opportunities for interactive entertainment and these technologies impact the way consumers play video games we expect that new platforms will continue to grow the consumer base for our products while also providing competition for established video game platforms 

further we are investing significantly in our own distribution platform which consumers are already using to purchase and play games directly from us through online portals such as origin and play4free we are acquiring consumers of our games and game services directly and establishing ongoing relationships with them through these relationships we are engaging them in their favorite brands across a number of devices allowing them to communicate with their friends and inviting them to try our other game experiences we have generated substantial growth in new business models and alternative revenue streams such as subscription microtransactions and advertising based on the continued expansion of our online and wireless platforms 

significant business developments in fiscal year 2012 

acquisition of popcap games inc  in august 2011 we acquired all of the outstanding shares of popcap games inc “popcap” a leading developer of casual games for mobile devices tablets pcs and social networking sites this acquisition strengthens our position in casual and social gaming – two of the fastest growing segments of our sector with the addition of popcap’s popular intellectual properties which include bejeweled plants v zombies zuma peggle and bookworm 

digital content distribution and services consumers are spending an everincreasing portion of their money and time on interactive entertainment that is accessible online or through mobile digital devices such as smart phones or through social networks such as facebook we provide a variety of onlinedelivered products and services including through our origin platform our packaged goods products are also available through direct online download through the internet we also offer onlinedelivered content and services that are addons or related to our packaged goods products such as additional game content or enhancements of multiplayer services further we provide other games content and services that are available only via electronic delivery such as internetonly games and game services and games for mobile devices 

  

   

advances in mobile technology have resulted in a variety of new and evolving devices that are being used to play games by an everbroadening base of consumers we have responded to these advances in technology and consumer acceptance of digital distribution by offering different sales models such as subscription services online downloads for a onetime fee microtransactions and advertisingsupported freetoplay games and game sites in addition we offer our consumers the ability to play a game across platforms on multiple devices on a nongaap basis our digital revenue has grown significantly from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2012 and the average revenue of our ten bestselling brands has continued to increase each year during this same period our profitability has also increased as digital revenue becomes a greater portion of our business reflecting the lower cost of digital revenue 

growth of casual and social games the popularity of wireless and other emerging gaming platforms such as smart phones tablets and social networking sites such as facebook has led to the growth of casual and social gaming casual and social games are characterized by their mass appeal simple controls flexible monetization including freetoplay and microtransaction business models and fun and approachable gameplay these games appeal to a larger consumer demographic of younger and older players and more female players than video games played on console devices these areas are among the fastest growing segments of our sector and we have responded to this opportunity by developing casual and social games based on our established intellectual properties such as the sims fifa and battlefield and with our acquisition of popcap we expect sales of social and casual games for wireless and other emerging platforms to continue to be an important part of our business

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs our business and financial performance could be harmed our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may harm our business and financial performance 

our business is intensely competitive and “hit” driven if we do not deliver “hit” products and services or if consumers prefer our competitors’ products or services over our own our operating results could suffer 

competition in our industry is intense and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge throughout the world our competitors range from large established companies to emerging startups in our industry though many new products and services are regularly introduced only a relatively small number of “hit” titles accounts for a significant portion of total revenue for the industry we have significantly reduced the number of games that we develop publish and distribute in fiscal year 2011 we published 36 primary packaged goods titles and in fiscal year 2012 we published 22 primary packaged goods titles including our mmo roleplaying game star wars the old republic  in fiscal year 2013 we expect to release 14 primary packaged goods titles and plan to build additional online features content and services around each of these titles publishing fewer titles means that we concentrate more of our development spending on each title and driving “hit” titles often requires large marketing budgets and media spend the underperformance of a title may have a large adverse impact on our financial results also hit products or services offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause revenue generated from our products and services to fall below expectations 

in addition both the online and mobile games marketplaces are characterized by frequent product introductions relatively low barriers to entry and new and evolving business methods technologies and platforms for development we expect competition in these markets to intensify if our competitors develop and market more successful products or services offer competitive products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering a better value proposition such as freetoplay or subscriptionbased models or if we do not continue to develop consistently highquality and wellreceived products and services our revenue margins and profitability will decline 

our operating results will be adversely affected if we do not consistently meet our product development schedules or if key events or sports seasons that we tie our product release schedules to are delayed or cancelled 

our business is highly seasonal with the highest levels of consumer demand and a significant percentage of our sales occurring in the december quarter if we miss these key selling periods for any reason including product delays product cancellations or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have developed products our sales will suffer disproportionately our ability to meet product development schedules is affected by a number of factors including the creative processes involved the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams required by the increasing complexity of our products and the platforms for which they are developed and the need to finetune our products prior to their release we have experienced development delays for our products in the past which caused us to push back or cancel release dates we also seek to release certain products in conjunction with specific events such as the beginning of a sports season or major sporting event or the release of a related movie if a key event or sports season to which our product release schedule is tied were to be delayed or cancelled our sales would also suffer disproportionately in the future any failure to meet anticipated production or release schedules would likely result in a delay of revenue andor possibly a significant shortfall in our revenue increase our development expense harm our profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different than anticipated 

  

our adoption of new business models could fail to produce our desired financial returns 

we are actively seeking to monetize game properties through a variety of new platforms and business models including online distribution of full games and additional content freetoplay games supported by advertising andor microtransactions on social networking services and subscription services such as our mmo roleplaying game star wars the old republic  forecasting our revenues and profitability for these new business models is inherently uncertain and volatile our actual revenues and profits for these businesses may be significantly greater or less than our forecasts additionally these new business models could fail for one or more of our titles resulting in the loss of our investment in the development and infrastructure needed to support these new business models and the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from more successful businesses 

technology changes rapidly in our business and if we fail to anticipate or successfully develop games for new platforms and services adopt new distribution technologies or methods or implement new technologies in our games the quality timeliness and competitiveness of our products and services will suffer 

rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate sometimes years in advance which technologies we must implement and take advantage of in order to make our products and services competitive in the market we have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies technologies products and services such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the technology we choose to adopt and the platforms products and services that we pursue will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

our product development usually starts with particular platforms and distribution methods in mind and a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve we may not be able to achieve these goals or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly and effectively than we can in either case our products and services may be technologically inferior to our competitors’ less appealing to consumers or both if we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule of our products and services then we may delay their release until these technology goals can be achieved which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses alternatively we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies either to preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up with our competition which would increase our development expenses we may also miss opportunities to adopt technology or develop products and services for new platforms or services that become popular with consumers which could adversely affect our revenues it may take significant time and resources to shift our focus to such technologies or platforms putting us at a competitive disadvantage 

if we release defective products or services our operating results could suffer 

products and services such as ours are extremely complex software programs and are difficult to develop and distribute we have quality controls in place to detect defects in our products and services before they are released nonetheless these quality controls are subject to human error overriding and reasonable resource constraints therefore these quality controls and preventative measures may not be effective in detecting defects in our products and services before they have been released into the marketplace in such an event we could be required to or may find it necessary to voluntarily recall a product or suspend the availability of the product or service which could significantly harm our business and operating results 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain adequate operational services security and supporting infrastructure 

as we increase our online products and services most recently with the launch of our online commerce and content delivery system origin and the launch of star wars the old republic  we expect to continue to invest in technology services hardware and software  including data centers network services storage and database technologies  to support existing services and to introduce new products and services including websites 

  

   

ecommerce capabilities online game communities and online game play services launching high profile games and services and creating the appropriate support for online business initiatives is expensive and complex and our execution could result in inefficiencies or operational failures and increased vulnerability to cyber attacks which in turn could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience cyber attacks could include denialofservice attacks impacting service availability and reliability the exploitation of software vulnerabilities in internet facing applications social engineering of system administrators tricking company employees into releasing control of their systems to a hacker the introduction of malware into our systems with a view to steal confidential or proprietary data or attempts to hijack consumer account information cyber attacks of increasing sophistication may be difficult to detect and could result in the theft of our intellectual property and consumer data including personally identifiable information operational failures or successful cyber attacks could result in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers advertisers and other business partners which could harm our business in addition we could be adversely impacted by outages and disruptions in the online platforms of our key business partners who offer our products and services 

our business could be adversely affected if our consumer protection and data privacy practices are not seen as adequate or there are breaches of our security measures or unintended disclosures of our consumer data 

there are several inherent risks to engaging in business online and directly with end consumers of our products and services as we conduct more transactions online directly with consumers we may be the victim of fraudulent transactions including credit card fraud which presents a risk to our revenues and potentially disrupts service to our consumers in addition we are collecting and storing more consumer information including personal information and credit card information we take measures to protect our consumer data from unauthorized access or disclosure it is possible that our security controls over consumer data may not prevent the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information a security breach that leads to disclosure of consumer account information including personally identifiable information could harm our reputation compel us to comply with disparate breach notification laws in various jurisdictions and otherwise subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue a resulting perception that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could result in a loss of current or potential consumers and business partners for our online offerings that require the collection of consumer data our key business partners also face these same risks and any security breaches of their system could adversely impact our ability to offer our products and services through their platforms resulting in a loss of meaningful revenues in addition the rate of privacy lawmaking is accelerating globally and interpretation and application of consumer protection and data privacy laws in the united states europe and elsewhere are often uncertain contradictory and in flux as business practices are being challenged by regulators private litigants and consumer protection agencies around the world it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data andor consumer protection practices if so this could result in increased litigation government or court imposed fines judgments or orders requiring that we change our practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

our business is subject to increasing regulation and the adoption of proposed legislation we oppose could negatively impact our business 

legislation is continually being introduced in the united states and other countries to mandate rating requirements or set other restrictions on the advertisement or distribution of entertainment software based on content in the united states most courts including the united states supreme court that have ruled on such legislation have ruled in a manner favorable to the interactive entertainment industry some foreign countries have adopted ratings regulations and certain countries allow government censorship of entertainment software products adoption of government ratings system or restrictions on distribution of entertainment software based on content could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers and compliance with new and possibly inconsistent regulations for different territories could be costly or delay the release of our products 

  

as we increase the online delivery of our products and services we are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet in addition laws and regulations relating to user privacy data collection and retention content advertising and information security have been adopted or are being considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation furthermore any failure on our part to comply with these laws or the application of these laws in an unanticipated manner may harm our business 

if we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel we will be unable to effectively conduct our business 

the market for technical creative marketing and other personnel essential to the development and marketing of our products and management of our businesses is extremely competitive our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of executives and key creative talent if we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need or replace key employees following their departure our ability to develop and manage our business will be impaired 

if our marketing and advertising efforts fail to resonate with our customers our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs such as television and online advertising print advertising retail merchandising website development and event sponsorship our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part upon the success of these programs if the marketing for our products and services fail to resonate with our customers particularly during the critical holiday season or during other key selling periods or if advertising rates or other media placement costs increase these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

the majority of our sales are made to a relatively small number of key customers if these customers reduce their purchases of our products or become unable to pay for them our business could be harmed 

during the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 approximately 60 percent of our north america sales were made to our top ten customers in europe our top ten customers accounted for approximately 40 percent of our sales in that territory during the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 worldwide we had direct sales to one customer gamestop corp which represented approximately 15 percent of total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 though our products are available to consumers through a variety of retailers and directly through us the concentration of our sales in one or a few large customers could lead to a shortterm disruption in our sales if one or more of these customers significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to carry our products and could make us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers became unable to pay for our products or declared bankruptcy additionally our receivables from these large customers increase significantly in the december quarter as they make purchases in anticipation of the holiday selling season also having such a large portion of our total net revenue concentrated in a few customers could reduce our negotiating leverage with these customers if one or more of our key customers experience deterioration in their business or become unable to obtain sufficient financing to maintain their operations our business could be harmed 

our business is dependent on the success and availability of video game hardware systems manufactured by third parties as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for these systems 

our products and services are played on video game hardware systems which we also refer to as “platforms” manufactured by third parties such as sony’s playstation 3 microsoft’s xbox 360 and nintendo’s wii the success of our business is driven in part by the commercial success and adequate supply of these video game hardware systems our ability to accurately predict which systems will be successful in the marketplace and our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for these systems we must make product 

  

   

development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of anticipated product ship dates a platform for which we are developing products and services may not succeed or may have a shorter life cycle than anticipated if consumer demand for the systems for which we are developing products and services is lower than our expectations our revenue will suffer we may be unable to fully recover the investments we have made in developing our products and services and our financial performance will be harmed alternatively a system for which we have not devoted significant resources could be more successful than we had initially anticipated causing us to miss out on meaningful revenue opportunities 

our industry is cyclical driven by the periodic introduction of new video game hardware systems as we transition to new console platforms our operating results may be more volatile 

video game hardware systems have historically had a life cycle of four to six years which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well the current cycle began with microsoft’s launch of the xbox 360 in 2005 and continued in 2006 when sony and nintendo launched the playstation 3 and the wii respectively we have seen a decline in the market for video game systems overall driven by reduced demand for standard definition systems this decline in sales of video game systems has caused a corresponding decline in the sales of packaged goods video game software 

we anticipate the transition to new console platforms in the next few years during this transition we will incur costs to develop and market products and services for currentgeneration video game platforms as well as developing products and services for nextgeneration platforms for fiscal year 2013 we plan to invest 80 million toward nextgeneration platforms the hardware manufacturers are not required to enter into agreements with us for nextgeneration video game platforms and may choose to impose more restrictive terms or adopt very different business models and fee structures for the nextgeneration platforms as a result our operating results during this transitional period may be more volatile and difficult to predict 

the video game hardware manufacturers are among our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of andor access to our video game products and services if they do not approve our products and services we will not be able to make the products and services available to our customers 

our agreements with hardware licensors such as sony for the playstation 3 microsoft for the xbox 360 and nintendo for the wii typically give significant control to the hardware licensor over the approval manufacturing and distribution of our products and services which could in certain circumstances leave us unable to get our products and services approved manufactured and provided to customers for our digital products and services delivered direct to the consumers via sony’s playstation network and microsoft’s xbox live marketplace the hardware licensor controls the distribution of these titles these hardware licensors are also among our chief competitors generally control of the approval and manufacturing process by the hardware licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently while we believe that our relationships with our hardware licensors are currently good the potential for these licensors to delay or refuse to approve our products and services exists such occurrences would harm our business and our financial performance 

we also require technical and operational support and the consent of sony microsoft and nintendo in order to include online capabilities in our products and services for their respective platforms and to digitally distribute our products and services through their proprietary networks as online capabilities for video game systems become more significant sony microsoft and nintendo could restrict the manner in which we provide online capabilities for our products and services and demand more restrictive terms for the nextgeneration console platforms they may also restrict the number of products and services that we may distribute digitally on their networks if sony microsoft or nintendo refuse to approve our products and services with online capabilities restrict our digital offerings on their proprietary networks or significantly impact the financial terms on which these services are offered to our customers our business could be harmed 

  

the video game hardware manufacturers set the royalty rates and other fees that we must pay to provide games for their platforms and therefore have significant influence on our costs if one or more of these manufacturers change their fee structure our profitability will be materially impacted 

in order to provide products and service for a video game system such as the xbox 360 playstation 3 or wii we must take a license from microsoft sony and nintendo respectively which give these companies the opportunity to set the fee structure that we must pay in order to provide games for that platform similarly these companies have retained the flexibility to change their fee structures or adopt different fee structures for online purchases of games online gameplay and other new features for their consoles the control that hardware manufacturers have over the fee structures for their platforms and online access could adversely impact our costs profitability and margins because providing products for video game systems is the largest portion of our business any increase in fee structures would significantly harm our ability to generate profits 

acquisitions investments and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties dilution to our investors and other negative consequences 

we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into other strategic transactions including 1 acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets 2 minority investments in strategic partners and 3 investments in new interactive entertainment businesses  eg online and mobile publishing platforms as part of our longterm business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment that we acquire unknown liabilities or that we experience difficulty in the integration of business systems and technologies the integration and retention of new employees or in the maintenance of key business and customer relationships of the businesses we acquire or diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses these events could harm our operating results or financial condition 

future acquisitions and investments could also involve the issuance of our equity and equitylinked securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses such as stockbased compensation any of the foregoing factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating performance that could have otherwise been achieved by us on a standalone basis our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

from time to time we may become involved in other legal proceedings which could adversely affect us 

we are currently and from time to time in the future may become subject to legal proceedings claims litigation and government investigations or inquiries which could be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations in addition the outcome of any legal proceedings claims litigation investigations or inquiries may be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

if we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to include intellectual property owned by others in our games or to maintain or acquire the rights to publish or distribute games developed by others we will sell fewer hit titles and our revenue profitability and cash flows will decline competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and reduce our profitability 

many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our ea sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players’ associations similarly many of our other key franchises such as star wars the old republic  are based on film and literary licenses and our hasbro products are based on a license for certain of hasbro’s toy and game properties in addition some of our successful products in fiscal year 2011 bulletstorm  crysis 2 and portal 2 in fiscal year 2012 are products for which we acquired publishing rights through a license from the product’s creatorowner competition for these licenses and rights is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses and rights or obtain additional licenses 

  

   

or rights with significant commercial value our revenues profitability and cash flows will decline significantly competition for these licenses may also drive up the advances guarantees and royalties that we must pay to licensors and developers which could significantly increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

our business is subject to risks generally associated with the entertainment industry any of which could significantly harm our operating results 

our business is subject to risks that are generally associated with the entertainment industry many of which are beyond our control these risks could negatively impact our operating results and include the popularity price and timing of our games and the platforms on which they are played economic conditions that adversely affect discretionary consumer spending changes in consumer demographics the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights which could harm our business 

from time to time third parties may assert claims against us relating to patents copyrights trademarks personal publicity rights or other intellectual property rights to technologies products or deliverypayment methods that are important to our business although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement for example we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from certain individuals and companies who have acquired patent portfolios for the sole purpose of asserting such claims against other companies in addition many of our products are highly realistic and feature materials that are based on real world examples which may be the subject of intellectual property infringement claims of others from time to time we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims existing or future infringement claims against us whether valid or not may be time consuming and expensive to defend such claims or litigations could require us to pay damages and other costs stop selling the affected products redesign those products to avoid infringement or obtain a license all of which could be costly and harm our business in addition many patents have been issued that may apply to potential new modes of delivering playing or monetizing game software products and services such as those that we produce or would like to offer in the future we may discover that future opportunities to provide new and innovative modes of game play and game delivery to consumers may be precluded by existing patents that we are unable to license on reasonable terms 

our products are subject to the threat of piracy and unauthorized copying 

we take measures to protect our prerelease software and other confidential information from unauthorized access a security breach that results in the disclosure of prerelease software or other confidential assets could lead or contribute to piracy of our games or otherwise compromise our product plans 

further entertainment software piracy is a persistent problem in our industry the growth in peertopeer networks and other channels to download pirated copies of our products the increasing availability of broadband access to the internet and the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures used with our products all have contributed to an expansion in piracy though we take technical steps to make the unauthorized copying of our products more difficult as do the manufacturers of consoles on which our games are played these efforts may not be successful in controlling the piracy of our products 

while legal protections exist to combat piracy and other forms of unauthorized copying preventing and curbing infringement through enforcement of our intellectual property rights may be difficult costly and time consuming particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights further the scope of the legal protection of copyright and prohibitions against the circumvention of technological protection measures to protect copyrighted works are often under scrutiny by courts and governing bodies the repeal or weakening of laws intended to combat piracy protect intellectual property and prohibit the circumvention of technological protection measures could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect against piracy these factors could have a negative effect on our growth and profitability in the future 

  

uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

declines in consumer spending resulting from adverse changes in the economy have in the past negatively impacted our business further economic distress may result in a decrease in demand for our products particularly during key product launch windows which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition in particular we derive a substantial proportion of our revenues in europe continued weakness and instability in european markets could result in a loss of consumer confidence in the economy and a decrease in discretionary spending resulting in a material adverse impact on our operating results uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could also increase the risk of material losses on our investments increase costs associated with developing and publishing our products increase the cost and decrease the availability of sources of financing and increase our exposure to material losses from bad debts any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results in addition if we experience further deterioration in our market capitalization or our financial performance we could be required to recognize significant impairment charges in future periods 

our business is subject to currency fluctuations 

international sales are a fundamental part of our business for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 international net revenue comprised 52 percent of our total net revenue we expect international sales to continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue such sales may be subject to unexpected regulatory requirements tariffs and other barriers additionally foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies which may fluctuate against the us dollar in addition our foreign investments and our cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies are subject to currency fluctuations we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate some foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily certain intercompany receivables and payables to a limited extent and foreign currency option contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions primarily related to a portion of the revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currency generated by our operational subsidiaries however these activities are limited in the protection they provide us from foreign currency fluctuations and can themselves result in losses in the past the disruption in the global financial markets has impacted many of the financial institutions with which we do business and we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to such institutions with whom we enter into hedging transactions a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of the disruption in the financial markets could negatively impact our treasury operations including our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs accordingly our results of operations including our reported net revenue operating expenses and net income and financial condition can be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations especially the euro british pound sterling and canadian dollar in particular because we derive a substantial proportion of our revenues from sales in europe the uncertainty regarding the ability of certain european countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations and related european financial restructuring efforts may cause fluctuations in the value of the euro that could adversely affect our revenue growth and profit margins on sales outside of the united states and thus impact our operating results expressed in us dollars in future periods further the continued sovereign debt crisis in europe could lead to increased counterparty risk with respect to financial institutions and other business partners who are particularly vulnerable to the instability in certain european markets 

volatility in the capital markets may adversely impact the value of our investments and could cause us to recognize significant impairment charges in our operating results 

our portfolio of shortterm investments and marketable equity securities is subject to volatility in the capital markets and to national and international economic conditions in particular our international investments can be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency and our shortterm investments are susceptible to changes in shortterm interest rates these investments are also impacted by declines in value attributable to the creditworthiness of the issuer from time to time we may liquidate some or all of our shortterm investments or marketable equity securities to fund operational needs or other activities such as capital expenditures strategic investments or 

  

   

business acquisitions or for other purposes if we were to liquidate these shortterm investments at a time when they were worth less than what we had originally purchased them for or if the obligor were unable to pay the full amount at maturity we could incur a significant loss similarly we hold marketable equity securities which have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by price and trading volume volatility in the public stock markets we could be required to recognize impairment charges on the securities held by us andor we may realize losses on the sale of these securities all of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 

while our 075 convertible senior notes due 2016 the “notes” are outstanding we will have debt service obligations on the notes of approximately 5 million per year we intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash generated by our operations and from our existing cash and investments we may enter into other financial instruments in the future 

our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

 further the notes are subject to a net share settlement feature which means that we will satisfy our conversion obligation to holders by paying cash in settlement of the lesser of the principal amount and the conversion value of the notes and by delivering shares of our common stock in settlement of any and all conversion obligations in excess of the principal amount in addition holders of the notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes for cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100 percent of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if any 

we may not have the enough available cash or be able to arrange for financing to pay such principal amount at the time we are required to make purchases of the notes or convert the notes in addition we may be required to use funds that are domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions in order to make the cash payments upon any purchase or conversion of the notes if we were to choose to use such funds we would be required to accrue and pay additional taxes on any portion of the repatriation where no united states income tax had been previously provided 

in addition our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness our failure to purchase the notes at a time when the purchase is required by the indenture or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture a default under the indenture or a fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness if the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes 

the hedge transactions and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the notes may affect the value of the notes and our common stock 

in connection with the offering of the notes we entered into privatelynegotiated convertible note hedge transactions the “convertible note hedge” with certain counterparties “options counterparties” to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes the convertible note hedge covers subject to antidilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the notes the number of 

  

shares of common stock underlying the notes we also entered into separate privatelynegotiated warrant transactions with the certain counterparties whereby we sold to independent third parties warrants the “warrants” with the option counterparties relating to the same number of shares of our common stock subject to customary antidilution adjustments 

in connection with establishing their hedge position with respect to the convertible note hedge and the warrants the option counterparties andor their affiliates 

 

  

 the effect if any of these activities including the direction or magnitude on the market price of our common stock will depend on a variety of factors including market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities could however adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes 

in addition the option counterparties are financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that one or more of the option counterparties might default under the convertible note hedge our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral if any of the option counterparties becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under the convertible note hedge with such option counterparty our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 

we are also required to estimate what our tax obligations will be in the future although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the estimation process and applicable laws are inherently uncertain and our estimates are not binding on tax authorities the tax laws’ treatment of software and internetbased transactions is particularly uncertain and in some cases currently applicable tax laws are illsuited to address these kinds of transactions apart from an adverse resolution of these uncertainties our effective tax rate also could be adversely affected by our profit levels by changes in our business or changes in our structure resulting from the reorganization of our business and operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the elections we make changes in applicable tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions or changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as well as other factors beginning in fiscal year 2009 we recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggest that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized further our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should our ultimate tax liability exceed our estimates our income tax provision and net income or loss could be materially affected 

we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our consolidated pretax income or loss as a result in absolute dollar terms our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pretax income or loss than at higher levels in addition at lower levels of pretax income or loss our effective tax rate will be more volatile 

  

   

we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under examination by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations changes in our business or changes in applicable tax rules will not have an adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition 

furthermore as we expand our international operations adopt new products and new distribution models implement changes to our operating structure or undertake intercompany transactions in light of changing tax laws expiring rulings acquisitions and our current and anticipated business and operational requirements our tax expense could increase 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves 

our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting standards promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies for example as we have recently issued notes which we account for under asc 47020 debt with conversion and other options  we are required to record a greater amount of noncash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes to their face amount over the term of the notes consequently we report lower net income in our financial results because asc 47020 requires interest expense to include both the current period’s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument’s coupon interest which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes furthermore we cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method with respect to the calculation of diluted earnings per share when considering our notes that may be settled entirely or partly in cash if we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected 

in addition accounting standards affecting software revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products and services we recognize all of the revenue from bundled sales  ie packaged goods video games that include updates on a whenandifavailable basis and an online service component on a deferred basis over an estimated online service period which we generally estimate to be six months beginning in the month after delivery as we increase our downloadable content and add new features to our online service our estimate of the online service period may change and we could be required to recognize revenue over a longer period of time 

as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue and taxes could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

we are implementing a new integrated financial information system to be used throughout our worldwide organization if this implementation is not completed in a successful and timely manner or if the new system fails to perform as expected our ability to accurately process prepare and analyze important financial data could be impeded and our business operations may be disrupted 

as part of our effort to improve efficiencies throughout our worldwide organization we are implementing a new integrated financial information system this implementation is expected to be completed by the first quarter of the fiscal year 2013 this system will integrate our order management product shipment cash management and financial accounting processes among others the successful conversion from our current multiple financial information systems to this new integrated financial information system entails a number of risks due to the complexity of the conversion and implementation process such risks include verifying the accuracy of the business data and information prior to conversion the actual conversion of that data and information to the new system and then using that business data and information in the new system after the conversion while testing these new systems and processes and training of employees are done in advance of implementation there are 

  

inherent limitations in our ability to simulate a fullscale operating environment in advance of implementation there can be no assurance that the conversion to and the implementation of the new financial information system will not impede our ability to accurately and timely process prepare and analyze the financial data we use in making operating decisions and which form the basis of the financial information we include in the periodic reports we file with the sec in addition a number of important operational functions including receiving product orders product shipments and inventory maintenance among others will be reliant on the new system and therefore any problems with the implementation or other system problems may result in a disruption to our business operations 

we rely on business partners in many areas of our business and our business may be harmed if they are unable to honor their obligations to us 

we rely on various business partners including thirdparty service providers vendors licensing partners development partners and licensees among others in many areas of our business in many cases these third parties are given access to sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support to our teams these third parties may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it the failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies or the failure of the third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies could result in a disruption to our business operations further disruptions in the financial markets and economic downturns may adversely affect our business partners and they may not be able to continue honoring their obligations to us some of our business partners are highlyleveraged or small businesses that may be particularly vulnerable alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner or vendor if we lose one or more significant business partners our business could be harmed 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors above as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts’ earnings estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts’ and investors’ expectations to factors affecting the entertainment computer software internet media or electronics industries to our ability to successfully integrate any acquisitions we may make or to national or international economic conditions in particular economic downturns may contribute to the public stock markets experiencing extreme price and trading volume volatility these broad market fluctuations have and could continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock

financial results 

total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 was 4143 million up 554 million as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 at march 31 2012 deferred net revenue associated with sales of onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content increased by 43 million as compared to march 31 2011 directly reducing the amount of reported net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 at march 31 2011 deferred net revenue associated with sales of onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content increased by 239 million as compared to march 31 2010 directly reducing the amount of reported net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 without these changes in deferred net revenue reported net revenue would have increased by approximately 358 million during fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 net revenue for fiscal year 2012 was driven by fifa 12 battlefield 3 and madden nfl 12  

net income for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 was 76 million as compared to a net loss of 276 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 was 023 as compared to a diluted loss per share of 084 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 net income increased for fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 primarily as a result of 1 a 455 million increase in gross profit due to a decrease in the change in deferred net revenue related to certain onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content and a greater percentage of net revenue from ea studio and digital products which have higher margins than our copublishing and distribution products and 2 a 145 million decrease in restructuring and other charges the increase in net income was partially offset by 1 a 106 million increase in marketing and sales costs 2 a 59 million increase in research and development costs and 3 a 74 million increase in general and administrative costs 

  

trends in our business 

digital content distribution and services  consumers are spending an everincreasing portion of their money and time on interactive entertainment that is accessible online or through mobile digital devices such as smart phones or through social networks such as facebook we provide a variety of onlinedelivered products and services including through our origin platform many of our games that are available as packaged goods products are also available through direct online download through the internet we also offer onlinedelivered content and services that are addons or related to our packaged goods products such as additional game content or enhancements of multiplayer services further we provide other games content and services that are available only via electronic delivery such as internetonly games and game services and games for mobile devices 

advances in mobile technology have resulted in a variety of new and evolving devices that are being used to play games by an everbroadening base of consumers we have responded to these advances in technology and consumer acceptance of digital distribution by offering different sales models such as subscription services online downloads for a onetime fee microtransactions and advertisingsupported freetoplay games and game sites in addition we offer our consumers the ability to play a game across platforms on multiple devices we significantly increased the revenues that we derive from wireless internetderived and advertising digital products and services from 743 million in fiscal year 2011 to 1159 million in fiscal year 2012 and we expect this portion of our business to continue to grow in fiscal 2013 and beyond 

wireless and other emerging platforms  advances in technology have resulted in a variety of platforms for interactive entertainment examples include wireless technologies streaming gaming services and internet platforms our efforts in wireless interactive entertainment are focused in downloadable games for mobile devices these platforms grow the consumer base for our business while also providing competition to existing established video game platforms we expect sales of games for wireless and other emerging platforms to continue to be an important part of our business 

growth of casual and social games the popularity of wireless and other emerging gaming platforms such as smart phones tablets and social networking sites such as facebook has led to the growth of casual and social gaming casual and social games are characterized by their mass appeal simple controls flexible monetization including freetoplay and microtransaction business models and fun and approachable gameplay these games appeal to a larger consumer demographic of younger and older players and more female players than video games played on console devices these areas are among the fastest growing segments of our sector and we have responded to this opportunity by developing casual and social games based on our established intellectual properties such as the sims fifa and battlefield and with our acquisition of popcap games we expect sales of casual and social and casual games for wireless and other emerging platforms to continue to be an important part of our business 

concentration of sales among the most popular games  we see a larger portion of packaged goods games sales concentrated on the most popular titles and those titles are typically sequels of prior games we have responded to this trend by significantly reducing the number of games that we produce to provide greater focus on our most promising intellectual properties we published 36 primary packaged goods titles in fiscal year 2011 22 in fiscal year 2012 and in fiscal year 2013 we expect to release 14 primary packaged goods titles and plan to build additional online features content and services around each of these titles 

evolving sales patterns  our business has evolved from a traditional packaged goods business model to one where our games are played on a variety of platforms including mobile devices and social networking sites our strategy is to transform our core intellectual properties into yearround businesses with a steady flow of downloadable content and extensions on new platforms our increasingly digital multiplatform business no longer reflects the retail sales patterns associated with traditional packaged goods launches for example we offer our consumers additional services andor additional content available through online services to further enhance the gaming experience and extend the time that consumers play our games after their initial purchase our social and casual games offer freetoplay and microtransaction models we also offer subscriptionbased products such as our mmo roleplaying game star wars the old republic  the revenues we derive from these services has become increasingly more significant yearoveryear our service revenue represented 13 percent 8 percent and 6 percent of total net revenue in fiscal year 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

   

recent developments 

stock repurchase program in february 2011 we announced that our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 600 million of our common stock over the next 18 months we completed our program in april 2012 we repurchased approximately 32 million shares in the open market since the commencement of the program including pursuant to prearranged stock trading plans during the fiscal year 2012 we repurchased and retired approximately 25 million shares of our common stock for approximately 471 million net of commissions 

international operations and foreign currency exchange impact international sales revenue derived from countries other than canada and the united states are a fundamental part of our business net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately 52 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2012 and approximately 49 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2011 our net revenue is impacted by foreign exchange rates during the reporting period associated with net revenue before revenue deferral as well as the foreign exchange rates associated with the recognition of deferred net revenue of onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content that were established at the time we recorded this deferred net revenue on our consolidated balance sheets the foreign exchange rates during the reporting period may not always move in the same direction as the foreign exchange rate impact associated with the recognition of deferred net revenue of onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content during the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 foreign exchange rates had an overall favorable impact on our net revenue of approximately 143 million or 3 percent in addition our international investments and our cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates if the us dollar strengthens against these currencies then foreign exchange rates may have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations and our financial condition 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities contingent assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown as a result actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

revenue recognition sales returns allowances and bad debt reserves 

we derive revenue principally from sales of interactive software games 1 on video game consoles such as the playstation 3 xbox 360 and wii and pcs 2 on mobile devices such the apple iphone and google compatible android phones 3 on tablets and electronic readers such as the apple ipad and amazon kindle and 4 from software and content and online game services associated with these products we evaluate revenue recognition based on the criteria set forth in financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” 985605 software revenue recognition  and staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 101 revenue recognition  as revised by sab no 104 revenue recognition  we classify our revenue as either product revenue or service and other revenue 

we evaluate and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met 

 

  

  

   

 determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and management judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report in each period changes to any of these assumptions and judgments could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

multipleelement arrangements 

we enter into multipleelement revenue arrangements in which we may provide a combination of game software updates or additional content and online game services for some software products we may provide updates or additional content “digital content” to be delivered via the internet that can be used with the original software product in many cases we separately sell this digital content for an additional fee in other transactions we may have an obligation to provide incremental unspecified digital content in the future without an additional fee  ie updates on a whenandifavailable basis or we may offer an online “matchmaking” service that permits consumers to play against each other via the internet collectively we refer to these as softwarerelated offerings in those situations where we do not require an additional fee for the softwarerelated offerings we account for the sale of the software product and softwarerelated offerings as a “bundled” sale or multiple element arrangement in which we sell both the software product and relating offerings for one combined price generally we do not have vsoe for the softwarerelated offerings and thus we defer net revenue from sales of these games and recognize the revenue from the bundled sales games over the period the offering will be provided the “offering period” if the period is not defined we recognize revenue over the estimated offering period which is generally estimated to be six months beginning in the month after delivery in addition determining whether we have an implicit obligation to provide incremental unspecified future digital content without an additional fee can be difficult determining the estimated offering period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage 

determining whether an element of a transaction constitutes an online game service or a digital content download of a product requires judgment and can be difficult the accounting for these transactions is significantly different revenue from product downloads is generally recognized when the download is made available assuming all other recognition criteria are met revenue from an online game service is recognized as the service is rendered if the period is not defined we recognize the revenue over the estimated service period for example our mmo games have an estimated service period of eighteen months beginning in the month after delivery 

for our software and softwarerelated multiple element arrangements  ie software game bundled with softwarerelated offerings we must make assumptions and judgments in order to 1 determine whether and when each element is delivered 2 determine whether the undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements 3 determine whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element and 4 allocate the total price among the various elements changes to any of these assumptions and judgments or changes to the elements in the arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

in some of our multiple element arrangements we sell tangible products with software andor softwarerelated offerings these tangible products are generally either peripherals or ancillary collectors’ items prior to april 3 2011 because either the software or other elements sold with the tangible products were essential to the functionality of the tangible product andor we did not have vsoe for the tangible product we did not separately account for the tangible product on april 3 2011 we adopted fasb asu 200913 revenue recognition topic 605 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements and asu 200914 software topic 985 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  the new accounting principles establish a selling price 

  

   

hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable and require the application of the relative selling price method to allocate the arrangement consideration to each deliverable in a multiple element arrangement that includes tangible products 

accordingly for our multiple element arrangements that include tangible products entered into after april 2 2011 revenue is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each deliverable using the relative selling prices of each deliverable in the arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy described below if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable the arrangement consideration is allocated to the software deliverables as a group and then allocated to each software deliverable in accordance with asc 985605 

we determine the selling price for a tangible product deliverable based on the following selling price hierarchy vsoe  ie  the price we charge when the tangible product is sold separately if available thirdparty evidence “tpe” of fair value  ie  the price charged by others for similar tangible products if vsoe is not available or our best estimate of selling price “besp” if neither vsoe nor tpe is available determining the besp is a subjective process that is based on multiple factors including but not limited to recent selling prices and related discounts market conditions customer classes sales channels and other factors 

as the result of adopting asu 200913 and asu 200914 for the year ended march 31 2012 we recognized 23 million more revenue than would have been recognized under previous accounting standards 

we reduce revenue for estimated future returns price protection and other offerings which may occur with our customers and channel partners price protection represents the right to receive a credit allowance in the event we lower our wholesale price on a particular product the amount of the price protection is generally the difference between the old price and the new price in certain countries we have stockbalancing programs for our pc and video game system software products which allow for the exchange of these software products by resellers under certain circumstances it is our general practice to exchange software products or give credits rather than to give cash refunds 

in certain countries from time to time we decide to provide price protection for our software products when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances we analyze historical returns current sellthrough of distributor and retailer inventory of our software products current trends in retail and the video game industry changes in customer demand and acceptance of our software products and other related factors in addition we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods 

in the future actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold software products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms product updates or competing software products while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters these estimates are inherently subjective accordingly if our estimates change our returns and price protection reserves would change which would impact the total net revenue we report for example if actual returns andor price protection were significantly greater than the reserves we have established our actual results would decrease our reported total net revenue conversely if actual returns andor price protection were significantly less than our reserves this would increase our reported total net revenue in addition if our estimates of returns and price protection related to onlineenabled packaged goods software products change the amount of deferred net revenue we recognize in the future would change 

significant management judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends and historical experience depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly 

  

fair value estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item in order to fairly present our financial statements without an independent market or another representative transaction determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the accounting 

there are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value these include 1 the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value 2 the income approach which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example future cash flows or future earnings to a single present value amount and 3 the cost approach which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset for many of our fair value estimates including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets we use the income approach using the income approach requires the use of financial models which require us to make various estimates including but not limited to 1 the potential future cash flows for the asset or liability being measured 2 the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows 3 the time value of money associated with the expected receipt or payment of such cash flows and 4 the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium making these cash flow estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate our financial results may be negatively impacted furthermore relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact to the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached for example a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired 

while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions the following areas are the most sensitive to these assessments 

business combinations  we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities and contingencies assumed acquired inprocess technology and contingent consideration issued in a business combination our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various estimated useful lives furthermore a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount we recognize as goodwill an asset that is not amortized determining the fair value of assets acquired requires an assessment of the highest and best use or the expected price to sell the asset and the related expected future cash flows determining the fair value of acquired inprocess technology also requires an assessment of our expectations related to the use of that asset determining the fair value of an assumed liability requires an assessment of the expected cost to transfer the liability determining the fair value of contingent consideration issued requires an assessment of the expected future cash flows over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled and applying a discount rate that appropriately captures a market participant’s view of the risk associated with the obligation this fair value assessment is also required in periods subsequent to a business combination such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

assessment of impairment of goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets current accounting standards require that we assess the recoverability of our finite lived acquisitionrelated intangible assets and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets is potentially impaired in order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred management must make various assumptions about the estimated fair value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated future cash flows for some assets our estimated fair value is dependent upon predicting which of our products will be successful this success is dependent upon several factors which are beyond our control such as which operating platforms will be successful in the marketplace also our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules 

on january 1 2012 we adopted asu 201108 intangibles – goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment  asu 201108 allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining 

  

   

whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test if an entity concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount it need not perform the twostep impairment test if based on that assessment we believe it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than its carrying value a twostep goodwill impairment test is required to be performed the first step measures for impairment by applying fair valuebased tests at the reporting unit level the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit our reporting units are determined by the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 

to determine the fair value of each reporting unit used in the first step we use the market approach which utilizes comparable companies’ data the income approach which utilizes discounted cash flows or a combination thereof determining whether an event or change in circumstances does or does not indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount is inherently subjective each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include longterm growth rates tax rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates based on a weighted average cost of capital future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables these estimates and assumptions have to be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment as of our last annual assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 we concluded that the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying amounts and we have not identified any indicators of impairment since our estimates for market growth our market share and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and certain external sources and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business our business consists of developing marketing and distributing video game software using both established and emerging intellectual properties and our forecasts for emerging intellectual properties are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information and have an inherently higher risk of inaccuracy if future forecasts are revised they may indicate or require future impairment charges we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

assessment of impairment of shortterm investments and marketable equity securities we periodically review our shortterm investments and marketable equity securities for impairment our shortterm investments consist of securities with remaining maturities greater than three months at the time of purchase and our marketable equity securities consist of investments in common stock of publicly traded companies both are accounted for as availableforsale securities unrealized gains and losses on our shortterm investments and marketable equity securities are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity net of tax until either 1 the security is sold 2 the security has matured or 3 we determine that the fair value of the security has declined below its adjusted cost basis and the decline is otherthantemporary realized gains and losses on our shortterm investments and marketable equity securities are calculated based on the specific identification method and are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income net and gains losses on strategic investments net respectively determining whether the decline in fair value is otherthantemporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each security the ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge including the credit quality of the issuer the duration that the fair value has been less than the adjusted cost basis severity of the impairment reason for the decline in value and potential recovery period the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the investees and our intent to sell and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value any contractual terms impacting the prepayment or settlement process as well as if we would be required to sell an investment due to liquidity or contractual reasons before its anticipated recovery our ongoing consideration of these factors could result in impairment charges in the future which could have a material impact on our financial results 

  

assessment of inventory obsolescence we regularly review inventory quantities onhand we write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products inventory writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market value based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently difficult to assess at the point of a loss recognition a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

adoption of asu 201104 on january 1 2012 we adopted the fasb accounting standards update “asu” 201104 fair value measurement topic 820 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss the guidance limits the highestandbestuse measure to nonfinancial assets permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts additionally the guidance expands the disclosures on level 3 inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

royalties and licenses 

our royalty expenses consist of payments to 1 content licensors 2 independent software developers and 3 copublishing and distribution affiliates license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities professional sports organizations movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks copyrights personal publicity rights content andor other intellectual property royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games copublishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of products 

royaltybased obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid these royaltybased obligations are generally expensed to cost of revenue generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on the total projected net revenue for contracts with guaranteed minimums significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors including 1 the total number of titles subject to the contract 2 the timing of the release of these titles 3 the number of software units we expect to sell which can be impacted by a number of variables including product quality the timing of the title’s release and competition and 4 future pricing determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products accordingly if our future revenue projections change our effective royalty rates would change which could impact the amount and timing of royalty expense we recognize 

prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and copublishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product and therefore we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product accordingly payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred payments due after completion of the product primarily royaltybased in nature are generally expensed as cost of revenue 

our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor when performance remains with the licensor we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract royalty liabilities are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next 12 months 

  

   

each quarter we also evaluate the expected future realization of our royaltybased assets as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales any impairments or losses determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense impairments or losses determined postlaunch are charged to cost of revenue we evaluate longlived royaltybased assets for impairment generally using undiscounted cash flows when impairment indicators exist unrecognized minimum royaltybased commitments are accounted for as executory contracts and therefore any losses on these commitments are recognized when the underlying intellectual property is abandoned  ie  cease use or the contractual rights to use the intellectual property are terminated 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carry forwards we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified it is generally difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is significant negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years forecasts of future taxable income are considered to be less objective than past results particularly in light of the economic environment therefore cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 

in addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities the carry back of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law and the implementation of tax planning strategies evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence this evaluation involves assumptions about future activity certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets 

based on the assumptions and requirements noted above we have recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets in addition we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggest that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized 

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate these estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation as well as with respect to other matters such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities the ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations in addition changes in our business including acquisitions changes in our international corporate structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix and amount of income as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities valuation allowances applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate 

we historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly no us taxes have been provided thereon we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states

net revenue 

net revenue consists of sales generated from 1 video games sold as packaged goods or as digital downloads and designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation 3 xbox 360 and wii and pcs 2 video games for mobile devices such as the apple iphone and google android compatible phones 3 video games for tablets and electronic readers such as the apple ipad and amazon kindle 4 software products and content and online game services associated with these products 5 programming thirdparty websites with our game content 6 allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products and 7 advertisements on our online web pages and in our games 

we provide three different measures of our net revenue two of these measures are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” – 1 net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue and 2 net revenue by geography the third measure is a nongaap financial measure – net revenue by revenue composition which is primarily based on method of distribution we use this third nongaap financial measure internally to evaluate our operating performance when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods and when assessing the performance of our management team 

management places a greater emphasis and focus on assessing our business through a review of the net revenue by revenue composition than by net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue these two measures differ as 1 net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue reflects the deferral and recognition of revenue in periods subsequent to the date of sale due to us gaap while net revenue by revenue composition does not and 2 both measures contain a different aggregation of sales from one another for instance service and other revenue does not include the majority of our fullgame digital download and mobile sales that are fully included in our digital revenue further service and other revenue includes all of our revenue associated with mmo games while software sales associated with our mmos are included in either digital revenue or publishing and other revenue depending on whether the sale was a fullgame digital download or a packaged goods sale 

net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue 

our total net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue for the fiscal years ended march 31 2012 and 2011 was as follows in millions 

 

 product revenue

supplemental net revenue by revenue composition 

as we continue to evolve our business and more of our products are delivered to consumers digitally via the internet we place a greater emphasis and focus on assessing our business through a review of net revenue by revenue composition 

net revenue before revenue deferral a nongaap financial measure is provided in this section of mda including a discussion of the components of this measure 1 publishing and other 2 wireless internetderived and advertising digital and 3 distribution see “nongaap financial measures” below for an explanation of our use of this nongaap financial measure a reconciliation to the corresponding measure calculated in accordance with us gaap is provided in the discussion below 

“revenue deferral” in this “net revenue” section includes the unrecognized revenue from 1 bundled sales of software and softwarerelated offerings for which we do not have vsoe for the softwarerelated offerings 2 certain sales of mmo games and 3 entitlements to content that are delivered through hosting services which are types of “microtransactions” fluctuations in the revenue deferral are largely dependent upon the amounts of products that we sell with the online features and services previously discussed while the recognition of revenue deferral for a period is also dependent upon 1 the amount deferred 2 the period of time the softwarerelated offerings are to be provided and 3 the timing of the sale for example most revenue deferrals incurred in the first half of a fiscal year are recognized within the same fiscal year however substantially all of the revenue deferrals incurred in the last month of a fiscal year will be recognized in the subsequent fiscal year 

our total net revenue by revenue composition for the fiscal years ended march 31 2012 and 2011 was as follows in millions 

 

 net revenue before revenue deferral 

publishing and other revenue 

publishing and other revenue includes 1 sales of our internallydeveloped and copublished game software distributed physically through traditional channels such as brick and mortar retailers 2 our nonsoftware licensing revenue and 3 our software licensing revenue from third parties for example makers of personal computers or computer accessories who include certain of our products for sale with their products “oem bundles” 

for fiscal year 2012 publishing and other net revenue before revenue deferral was 2736 million primarily driven by battlefield 3 fifa 12  and madden nfl 12  publishing and other net revenue before revenue deferral for fiscal year 2012 decreased 45 million or 2 percent as compared to fiscal year 2011 this decrease was driven by a 1163 million decrease in sales primarily from the medal of honor need for speed fifa world cup dragon age and dead space franchises this decrease was offset by a 1118 million increase in sales primarily from the battlefield mass effect and fifa franchises 

  

   

wireless internetderived and advertising digital revenue 

digital revenue includes revenue from sales of our internallydeveloped and copublished game software distributed through direct download through the internet including through our directtoconsumer platform origin or distributed wirelessly through mobile carriers this includes our fullgame downloads mobile and tablet revenue each of which are generally classified as product revenue with the exception of our mmo game downloads which are classified as service revenue as well as subscription services microtransactions and advertising revenues each of which is generally classified as service and other revenue 

for fiscal year 2012 digital net revenue before deferral was 1227 million an increase of 394 million or 47 percent as compared to fiscal year 2011 this increase was driven by a 452 million increase in sales primarily from the fifa and the sims franchises as well as star wars the old republic  this increase was offset by a 58 million decrease in sales primarily from the tetris and warhammer franchises as well as a decrease in sales generated by our pogobranded online services 

distribution revenue 

distribution revenue includes 1 sales of game software developed by independent game developers that we distribute and 2 sales through our switzerland distribution business for fiscal year 2012 distribution net revenue was 223 million and increased 9 million or 4 percent as compared to fiscal year 2011 driven by an 89 million increase in sales in the portal franchise this increase was offset by an 80 million decrease primarily driven by a decrease in sales in the rock band franchise 

revenue deferral 

revenue deferral for fiscal year 2012 increased 373 million or 13 percent as compared to fiscal year 2011 this increase was primarily due to 1 a 47 percent increase in our current year digital sales and 2 a higher percentage of both our publishing and digital sales being deferred and recognized over time due in part to a 135 percent increase in fullgame download sales and a 47 percent increase in microtransaction sales of which both contain an online service component which requires revenue recognition as the service is delivered 

recognition of revenue deferral 

the vast majority of our sales are deferred and recognized over a six month period and therefore the related revenue recognized in any fiscal year is primarily due to sales that occurred during the respective twelve months period ended december 31 the recognition of revenue deferral for fiscal year 2012 increased 569 million or 22 percent as compared to fiscal year 2011 this increase was primarily due to increased publishing and digital sales during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 and a higher percentage of those sales being comprised of games sales that have an online service component as compared to the same period in fiscal year 2011 

net revenue 

for fiscal year 2012 net revenue was 4143 million and increased 554 million or 15 percent as compared to fiscal year 2011 this increase was driven by a 1312 million increase in revenue primarily from the battlefield crysis and fifa franchises this increase was offset by a 758 million decrease in revenue primarily from the medal of honor fifa world cup and army of two franchises as well as dante’s inferno  for which there were no iterations in fiscal year 2012 

  

our product and service and other revenue by revenue composition for the fiscal years 2012 and 2011 was as follows in millions 

 

 nongaap financial measures 

net revenue before revenue deferral is a nongaap financial measure that excludes the impact of revenue deferral and the recognition of revenue deferral on net revenue related to sales of games and digital content 

revenue deferral includes the unrecognized revenue from 1 bundled sales of software and softwarerelated offerings for which we do not have vsoe for the softwarerelated offerings 2 certain sales of mmo games and 3 entitlements to content that are delivered through hosting services which are types of “microtransactions” we recognize the revenue from these games over the estimated period 

we believe that excluding the impact of revenue deferral and the recognition of revenue deferral related to games and digital content from our operating results is important to facilitate comparisons between periods in understanding our underlying sales performance for the period and understanding our operations because all related costs of revenues are expensed as incurred instead of deferred and recognized ratably we use this nongaap financial measure internally to evaluate our operating performance when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods and when assessing the performance of our management team while we believe that this nongaap financial measure is useful in evaluating our business this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap in addition this nongaap financial measure may not be the same as nongaap financial measures presented by other companies

cost of service and other revenue consists primarily of 1 data center and bandwidth costs associated with hosting our online games and websites 2 platform processing fees from operating our websitebased games on third party platforms 3 associated royalty costs 4 credit card fees associated with our service revenue and 5 server costs related to our website advertising business 

cost of service and other revenue increased by 132 million or 1435 percent in fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 the increase was primarily due to increased server and support costs due to the release of more onlineconnected and subscriptionbased titles and related content during fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 as our service revenue in fiscal year 2013 is expected to increase as compared to fiscal year 2012 we expect a corresponding increase in our service and support costs 

total cost of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue 

during fiscal year 2012 total cost of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue decreased by 32 percent as compared to fiscal year 2011 this decrease as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to 1 a greater percentage of net revenue from our digital products that have a lower cost than our other products which positively impacted gross profit as a percentage of total revenue by approximately 35 percent and 2 a 196 million decrease in the change in deferred net revenue related to certain onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content for fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 which positively impacted gross profit as a percent of total net revenue by 22 percent these decreases are partially offset by 1 increased expenses related to our online and customer experience initiatives which negatively impacted gross profit as a percentage of total net revenue by 12 percent 2 an increase in amortization of our acquisitionrelated intangibles resulting mainly from the popcap acquisition in fiscal year 2012 which negatively impacted gross profit as a percentage of total net revenue by 09 percent and 3 an increase in sales of our distribution products which carry a higher royalty percentage than our other products which negatively impacted gross profit as a percentage of total net revenue by 09 percent

 our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2012 was a tax benefit of 3222 percent our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2011 was a tax benefit of 11 percent in fiscal year 2012 we recorded approximately 58 million of additional net deferred tax liabilities related to the popcap and klicknation corporation “klicknation” acquisitions these additional deferred tax liabilities create a new source of taxable income thereby requiring us to release a portion of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance with a related reduction in income tax expense of 58 million in addition during the three months ended march 31 2012 we recorded 48 million of additional tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations in nonus tax jurisdictions 

consistent with prior years the fiscal year 2012 effective tax rate continues to differ from the statutory rate of 350 percent as a result of the utilization of us deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance and nonus profits subject to a reduced or zero tax rate partially offset by nondeductible stockbased compensation in addition the fiscal year 2012 effective tax rate is impacted by tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and the resolution of examinations by taxing authorities as well as a reduction in the us valuation allowance related to the popcap and klicknation acquisitions in fiscal year 2011 the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 350 percent primarily due to us losses for which no benefit is recognized nonus losses with a reduced or zero tax benefit and nondeductible stockbased compensation expenses partially offset by tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of examination by taxing authorities 

our effective income tax rates for fiscal year 2013 and future periods will depend on a variety of factors including changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance as well as changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions changes in our international structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix of income changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in our annual pretax income or loss we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our pretax consolidated income or loss as a result in absolute dollar terms our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pretax income or loss than at higher levels in addition at lower levels of pretax income or loss our effective tax rate will be more volatile 

certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law have not been considered as a source of future taxable income that is available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets 

  

   

the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 the “act” was signed into law on december 17 2010 the act contains a number of provisions including most notably a two year extension of the research tax credit the act did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 due to the effect of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 

we historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly no us taxes have been provided thereon we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states

impact of recently issued accounting standards

in december 2011 the fasb issued asu 201111 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  which creates new disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity’s rights of offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments the disclosure requirements are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january 1 2013 and interim periods therein with retrospective application required the new disclosures are designed to make financial statements that are prepared under us generally accepted accounting principles more comparable to those prepared under international financial reporting standards we are evaluating the impact of asu 201111 on our consolidated financial statements 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 changes in cash flow 

operating activities cash provided by operating activities decreased 43 million during the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 primarily due to 1 an increase in expenses due to our online and customer experience initiatives 2 an increase in personnelrelated costs from recent acquisitions and 3 an increase in marketing advertising and promotional spending on our franchises this difference is partially offset by a greater percentage of net revenue from our digital products which have a higher margin than our other products 

investing activities cash used in investing activities increased 674 million during the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 primarily due to a 660 million increase in cash used for acquisitions the majority of which was used to fund our acquisition of popcap and a 113 million increase in capital expenditures contributing to this increase we received 132 million in proceeds from the sale of our ubisoft and the9 investments during the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 with no comparable sale of our investments during the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 these items were partially offset by 1 a 84 million increase in proceeds received from the maturities and sales of shortterm investments 2 a 75 million increase due to the release of restriction on previously classified restricted cash due to the achievement of certain performance milestones in connection with our acquisition of playfish 3 a 46 million decrease in the purchase of shortterm investments and 4 26 million proceeds received from the sale of our facility in chertsey england 

financing activities cash provided by financing activities increased 163 million during the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 primarily due to 1 617 million in proceeds received from the sale of 075 convertible senior notes due 2016 net of issuance costs and 2 65 million proceeds received from the issuance of warrants in connection with the notes these items were partially offset by 1 a 413 million increase in the repurchase and retirement of our common stock net of commissions pursuant to our stock repurchase program and 2 107 million paid for the purchase of the convertible note hedge 

  

   

shortterm investments and marketable equity securities

the fair value of our marketable equity securities decreased to 119 million as of march 31 2012 from 161 million as of march 31 2011 primarily due to a decrease in the value of our investment in neowiz 

restricted cash and contingent consideration 

as of march 31 2012 primarily in connection with our acquisitions of popcap klicknation and chillingo limited “chillingo” we may be required to pay an additional 572 million of cash consideration based upon the achievement of certain performance milestones through march 31 2015 in fiscal year 2010 in connection with our playfish acquisition we deposited 100 million into an escrow account related to the contingent consideration during the three months ended march 31 2012 25 million was paid to settle performance milestones earned through december 31 2011 in connection with the playfish acquisition and 50 million was reclassified and converted to available cash and cash equivalents as of march 31 2012 25 million remains in restricted cash related to the playfish performance milestones which we expect to pay in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 in addition in connection with our popcap acquisition we acquired an additional 6 million of restricted cash which is held in an escrow account in the event that certain liabilities become due as these deposits are restricted in nature they are excluded from cash and cash equivalents as of march 31 2012 the restricted cash of 31 million is included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets

in connection with this plan we anticipate incurring approximately 40 million in total costs of which approximately 31 million will result in future cash expenditures all of these charges are expected to occur during the fiscal year ending march 31 2013 these costs will consist of severance and other employeerelated costs approximately 23 million license termination costs approximately 11 million and other costs approximately 6 million 

financing arrangement 

in july 2011 we issued 6325 million aggregate principal amount of 075 convertible senior notes due 2016 the “notes” the notes are senior unsecured obligations which pay interest semiannually in arrears at a rate of 075 percent per annum on january 15 and july 15 of each year beginning on january 15 2012 and will mature on july 15 2016 unless earlier purchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date the notes are convertible into cash and shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion value of 315075 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of 

  

approximately 3174 per share upon conversion of the notes holders will receive cash up to the principal amount of each note and any excess conversion value will be delivered in shares of our common stock we used the net proceeds of the notes to finance our acquisition of popcap which closed in august 2011 

prior to april 15 2016 the notes will be convertible only upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods and thereafter at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the notes the notes do not contain any financial covenants 

the conversion rate is subject to customary antidilution adjustments but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest following certain corporate events described in the indenture governing the notes the “indenture” that occur prior to the maturity date the conversion rate will be increased for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such corporate event in certain circumstances the notes are not redeemable prior to maturity and no sinking fund is provided for the notes 

if we undergo a “fundamental change” as defined in the indenture subject to certain conditions holders may require us to purchase for cash all or any portion of their notes the fundamental change purchase price will be 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the fundamental change purchase date 

the indenture contains customary terms and covenants including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing either the trustee or the holders of at least 25 percent in principal amount of the outstanding notes may declare 100 percent of the principal and accrued and unpaid interest on all the notes to be due and payable 

in addition in july 2011 we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions the “convertible note hedge” with certain counterparties to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes the convertible note hedge subject to customary antidilution adjustments provide us with the option to acquire on a net settlement basis approximately 199 million shares of our common stock at a strike price of 3174 which corresponds to the conversion price of the notes and is equal to the number of shares of our common stock that notionally underlie the notes as of march 31 2012 we have not purchased any shares under the convertible note hedge we paid 107 million for the convertible note hedge 

separately we have also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the certain counterparties whereby we sold to independent third parties warrants the “warrants” to acquire subject to customary antidilution adjustments that are substantially the same as the antidilution provisions contained in the notes up to 199 million shares of our common stock which is also equal to the number of shares of our common stock that notionally underlie the notes with a strike price of 4114 the warrants could have a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of its common stock exceeds 4114 on or prior to the expiration date of the warrants we received proceeds of 65 million from the sale of the warrants 

see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our 075 convertible senior notes due 2016 

financial condition 

we believe that cash cash equivalents shortterm investments marketable equity securities cash generated from operations and available financing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next 12 months including working capital requirements capital expenditures and potentially future acquisitions stock repurchases or strategic investments we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position facilitate expansion repurchase our stock pursue strategic acquisitions and investments andor to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise there can be no assurance however that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms if at all or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 

  

   

as of march 31 2012 approximately 878 million of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and 57 million of our marketable equity securities were domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions while we have no plans to repatriate these funds to the united states in the short term if we choose to do so we would be required to accrue and pay additional taxes on any portion of the repatriation where no united states income tax had been previously provided 

in february 2011 we announced that our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 600 million of our common stock over the next 18 months we completed our program in april 2012 we repurchased approximately 32 million shares in the open market since the commencement of the program including pursuant to prearranged stock trading plans during the fiscal year 2012 we repurchased and retired approximately 25 million shares of our common stock for approximately 471 million net of commissions 

we have a “shelf” registration statement on form s3 on file with the sec this shelf registration statement which includes a base prospectus allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus we would use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes including for working capital financing capital expenditures research and development marketing and distribution efforts and if opportunities arise for acquisitions or strategic alliances pending such uses we may invest the net proceeds in interestbearing securities in addition we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time 

our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those related to customer demand and acceptance of our products our ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due successfully achieving our product release schedules and attaining our forecasted sales objectives the impact of acquisitions and other strategic transactions in which we may engage the impact of competition economic conditions in the united states and abroad the seasonal and cyclical nature of our business and operating results risks of product returns and the other risks described in the “risk factors” section included in part i item 1a of this report

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market prices which have experienced significant volatility in light of the global economic downturn market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks foreign currency option and forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below while we do not hedge our shortterm investment portfolio we protect our shortterm investment portfolio against different market risks including interest rate risk as discussed below our cash and cash equivalents portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase we also do not currently hedge our market price risk relating to our marketable equity securities and we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

cash flow hedging activities  from time to time we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreigncurrencydenominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing foreign currency option contracts that generally have maturities of 15 months or less these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges the derivative assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity the gross amount of the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is subsequently reclassified into net revenue or research and development expenses as appropriate in the period when the forecasted transaction is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations in the event that the gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are deemed to be ineffective the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value if any is reclassified to interest and other income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur or it becomes remote that they will occur within the defined hedge period the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations during the reporting periods all forecasted transactions occurred and therefore there were no such gains or losses reclassified into interest and other income expense net our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements in net revenue and research and development expenses as of march 31 2012 we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately 74 million in foreign currency and to sell approximately 78 million of foreign currency all of the foreign currency option contracts outstanding as of march 31 2012 will mature in the next 12 months as of march 31 2011 we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately 40 million in foreign currency and to sell approximately 10 million of foreign currencies as of march 31 2012 these foreign currency option contracts outstanding had a total fair value of 2 million and are included in other current assets as of march 31 2011 the fair value of these outstanding foreign currency option contracts was immaterial and are included in other current assets 

balance sheet hedging activities  we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily intercompany receivables and payables the foreign currency forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three months or less and are transacted near monthend our foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as other current assets or accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in interest and other income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations the gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities which are also reported in interest and other income expense net in our consolidated statements of 

  

operations in certain cases the amount of such gains and losses will significantly differ from the amount of gains and losses recognized on the underlying foreigncurrencydenominated monetary asset or liability in which case our results will be impacted as of march 31 2012 we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell approximately 242 million in foreign currencies of this amount 197 million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars 37 million to purchase foreign currency in exchange for us dollars and 8 million to sell foreign currency in exchange for british pound sterling as of march 31 2011 we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell approximately 187 million in foreign currencies of this amount 140 million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars 31 million to purchase foreign currency in exchange for us dollars and 16 million to sell foreign currency in exchange for british pound sterling the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was immaterial as of march 31 2012 and 2011 

we believe the counterparties to these foreign currency forward and option contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material the disruption in the global financial markets has impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business further the continued sovereign debt crisis in europe could lead to increased counterparty risk with respect to financial institutions and other business partners who are particularly vulnerable to the instability in certain european markets a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of the disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations as of march 31 2012 a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value of the premiums on our foreign currency option contracts used in cash flow hedging of less than 2 million in each scenario as of march 31 2012 a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would have resulted in potential losses on our foreign currency forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of 24 million and 37 million respectively this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar however all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and actual results may differ materially 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities however because shortterm investments mature relatively quickly and are required to be reinvested at the thencurrent market rates interest income on a portfolio consisting of shortterm investments is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term investments additionally the contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to call prepay or otherwise settle the investments at prices less than the stated par value our investments are held for purposes other than trading also we do not use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio 

  

   

as of march 31 2012 and 2011 our shortterm investments were classified as availableforsale securities and consequently were recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in stockholders’ equity our portfolio of shortterm investments consisted of the following investment categories summarized by fair value as of march 31 2012 and 2011 in millions 

 

 notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations at any time a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio the following table presents the hypothetical changes in the fair value in our shortterm investment portfolio as of march 31 2012 arising from potential changes in interest rates the modeling technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps 

 

 the following table presents the hypothetical changes in the fair value in our shortterm investment portfolio as of march 31 2011 arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 

 

 market price risk 

the fair value of our marketable equity securities in publiclytraded companies is subject to market price volatility and foreign currency risk for investments denominated in foreign currencies as of march 31 2012 and 2011 our marketable equity securities were classified as availableforsale securities and consequently were recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in stockholders’ equity the fair value of our marketable equity securities as of march 31 2012 and 2011 was 119 million and 161 million respectively 

  

our marketable equity securities have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by volatility in the public stock markets at any time a sharp change in market prices in our investments in marketable equity securities could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investments the following table presents hypothetical changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities as of march 31 2012 arising from changes in market prices of plus or minus 25 percent 50 percent and 75 percent 

 

 the following table presents hypothetical changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities as of march 31 2011 arising from changes in market prices of plus or minus 25 percent 50 percent and 75 percent

 item 1 business tableend we develop market publish and distribute game software and content that can be played by consumers on a variety of video game machines and electronic devices which we call “platforms” including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our ability to publish games across multiple platforms has been and will continue to be a cornerstone of our product strategy technology advances continue to create new platforms for interactive entertainment examples include wireless technologies streaming gaming services and internetconnected televisions we expect that new platforms such as these will continue to grow the consumer base for our products while also providing competition for established video game platforms 

our products for videogame consoles pcs and handhelds are delivered on physical media disks and cartridges that are sold at retailers we call these “packaged goods” products or by us directly to consumers we also deliver game content and services online for the platforms listed above through digital downloads in addition we offer online delivered content and services as addons or as related features to our packaged goods products  eg  addon content or matchmaking services while other games content and services that we offer such as games for mobile devices and internetonly games are available only through online delivery we believe that online delivery of game content and services has become and will continue to be an increasingly important part of our business 

our games span a diverse range of categories including actionadventure casual family fantasy firstperson shooter horror massivelymultiplayer online roleplaying music racing simulation sports and strategy we 

  

have created licensed and acquired a strong portfolio of intellectual property which we market and sell to a variety of consumers our portfolio of whollyowned properties includes established brands such as battlefield dead space  dragon age mass effect medal of honor need for speed and the sims our portfolio of games based on licensed intellectual property includes sportsbased titles such as madden nfl and fifa and titles based on popular brands such as harry potter and hasbro’s toy and game intellectual properties through our ea partners business we also publish or distribute video games that are developed by other companies including the crysis series developed by crytek and the epic games title bulletstorm  

another cornerstone of our strategy is to publish products that can be iterated or sequeled for example a new edition for most of our sports products such as madden nfl is released each year other products such as the sims and battlefield are sequeled on a lessfrequent basis we refer to these successful iterated product families as “franchises” we also make addon content available for purchase online or through expansion packs sold at retail for many of our products 

we develop our games using both internal and external resources for the fiscal years ended march 31 2011 2010 and 2009 research and development expenses were 1153 million 1229 million and 1359 million respectively we operate development studios which develop products and perform other related functions worldwide bioware canada and united states bright light united kingdom criterion united kingdom dice sweden ea canada ea los angeles united states ea mobile canada romania australia india and korea maxis united states playfish canada united states united kingdom china norway and japan ea salt lake city united states ea seoul studio korea ea mythic united states pogo canada united states china and india the sims studio united states ea tiburon united states and visceral united states canada australia china  we have quality assurance functions located in the united states canada the united kingdom sweden germany romania china india and korea and localization functions located in spain germany singapore and japan we also engage third parties to assist with the development of our games at their own development and production studios 

our north america net revenue which was primarily generated in the united states was 1836 million as compared to 2025 million in fiscal year 2010 and 2412 million in fiscal year 2009 this trend reflects in part our strategy to focus on higher margin opportunities by significantly reducing the number of games that we publish andor distribute in order to reduce costs and provide greater focus on our most promising intellectual properties it also reflects the impact of increased revenue deferrals as further explained in the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” elsewhere in this form 10k 

internationally we conduct business through our international headquarters in switzerland and have whollyowned subsidiaries throughout the world including offices in europe australia asia and latin america international net revenue revenue derived from countries other than canada and the united states increased by 8 percent to 1753 million or 49 percent of total net revenue in fiscal year 2011 as compared to 1629 million or 45 percent of total net revenue in fiscal year 2010 and as compared to 1800 million or 43 percent of total net revenue in fiscal year 2009 the amounts of net revenue and longlived assets attributable to each of our geographic regions for each of the last three fiscal years are set forth in note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

in fiscal year 2011 revenue from sales of fifa 11 represented approximately 11 percent of our total net revenue in fiscal years 2010 and 2009 no title accounted for 10 percent or more of our total net revenue 

significant business developments in fiscal year 2011 

stock repurchase program 

in february 2011 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a program to repurchase up to 600 million of our common stock over the next 18 months as of march 31 2011 we had repurchased 58 million of our common stock or approximately 3 million shares in the open market since the commencement of the program including pursuant to a prearranged stock trading plan 

  

   

under the program we may purchase stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws including pursuant to prearranged stock trading plans the timing and actual amount of the stock repurchases will depend on several factors including price capital availability regulatory requirements alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions we are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares under the program and the repurchase program may be modified suspended or discontinued at any time 

fiscal 2011 restructuring plan 

in fiscal year 2011 we announced a plan focused on the restructuring of certain licensing and developer agreements in an effort to improve the longterm profitability of our packaged goods business under this plan we amended certain licensing and developer agreements to a much lesser extent as part of this restructuring we have had workforce reductions and facilities closures through march 31 2011 substantially all of these exit activities were completed by march 31 2011 

digital content distribution and services 

in fiscal year 2011 we significantly increased the revenues that we derive from onlinedelivered products and services and we expect this portion of our business to continue to grow in fiscal year 2012 and beyond substantially all of our games contain digital content many of our games that are available as packaged goods products are also available through direct online download through the internet we also offer onlinedelivered content and services that are addons or related to our packaged goods products such as additional game content or enhancements of multiplayer services further we provide other games content and services that are available only via electronic delivery such as internetonly games and game services and games for mobile devices in fiscal year 2011 we made strategic investments in our digital business with the acquisition of chillingo limited a leading publisher of games and software for mobile platforms additionally we expect to launch the highly anticipated massivelymultiplayer online roleplaying game star wars the old republic

competition 

we compete with other video game companies for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers as well as with providers of different forms of entertainment such as motion pictures television social networking online casual entertainment and music our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large diversified corporations with global operations and greater financial resources than ours we also face competition from other video game companies and large media companies to obtain license agreements for the right to use some of the intellectual property included in our products 

competition in sales of packaged goods 

the packaged goods video game business is characterized by the frequent launch of new games which may be sequels of popular game franchises or newly introduced game concepts there is also rapid technological innovation in the packaged goods game business as competing companies continually improve their use of the powerful platforms on which games are designed to run and extend the game experience through additional content and online services such as matchmaking and multiplayer functionality competition is also based on product quality and features timing of product releases brandname recognition availability and quality of ingame content access to distribution channels effectiveness of marketing and price 

for sales of packaged goods we compete directly with sony microsoft and nintendo each of which develop and publish software for their respective console platforms we also compete with numerous companies which like us develop and publish video games that operate on these consoles and on pcs and handheld game players these competitors include activision blizzard atari capcom koei konami lucasarts namco sega taketwo interactive thq and ubisoft diversified media companies such as fox disney time warner and viacom are also involved in software game publishing 

due in large part to the repurchase and sale of used video games by retailers many of our console games are experiencing sales cycles that are shorter than in the past to mitigate this trend we offer our consumers ongoing services such as multiplayer capability and additional content to further enhance the gaming experience and extend the time that consumers play our games after their initial purchase 

competition in games for mobile devices 

the marketplace for mobile games is characterized by frequent product introductions rapidly emerging new mobile platforms new technologies and new mobile application storefronts as the penetration of mobile devices that feature fullyfunctional browsers and additional gaming capabilities continues to deepen the demand for applications continues to increase and there are more mobile application storefronts through which developers can offer products mobile game applications are currently being offered by a wide range of competitors including capcom mobile gameloft glu mobile ngmoco popcap and zynga and hundreds of smaller companies we expect new competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources to develop and market competing applications as a result we expect competition in the mobile entertainment market to intensify 

competition in online gaming services 

the online  ie  internetbased games market is characterized by frequent product introductions new and evolving business models and new platforms as the proportion of households with a broadband connection continues to grow we expect new competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources toward developing online games services as a result we expect competition in the online game services market to intensify 

our current and potential competitors in the online games market include major media companies traditional video game publishing companies and companies that specialize in online games including social networking game companies in the massively multiplayer online game business our competitors include activision 

  

blizzard atari nc soft and sony competing providers of other kinds of online games include aol big fish msn nexon popcap real yahoo and zynga and other providers of games on social networking platforms such as facebook 

intellectual property 

like other entertainment companies our business is based on the creation acquisition exploitation and protection of intellectual property some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code patented technology and other technology and trade secrets that we use to develop our games and to make them run properly other intellectual property is in the form of audiovisual elements that consumers can see hear and interact with when they are playing our games – we call this form of intellectual property “content” 

we develop games from whollyowned intellectual properties we create within our own studios and obtain through acquisitions in addition we obtain content and intellectual property through licenses and service agreements such as those with sports leagues and players’ associations movie studios and performing talent authors and literary publishers music labels music publishers and musicians these agreements typically limit our use of the licensed rights in products for specific time periods in addition our products that play on game consoles handhelds and mobile devices include technology that is owned by the console or mobile device manufacturer and licensed nonexclusively to us for use we also license technology from providers other than console and mobile device manufacturers while we may have renewal rights for some licenses our business and the justification for the development of many of our products is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain the intellectual property rights from the owners of these rights on reasonable terms 

we actively engage in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property we typically own the copyright to the software code as well as the brand or title name trademark under which our products are marketed we register copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries as appropriate 

as with other forms of entertainment our products are susceptible to unauthorized copying and piracy we typically distribute our pc products using copy protection technology digital rights management technology or other technological protection measures to prevent piracy and the use of unauthorized copies of our products in addition console manufacturers typically incorporate technological protections and other security measures in their consoles in an effort to prevent the use of unlicensed product we are actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect against unauthorized copying and piracy including monitoring online channels for distribution of pirated copies and participating in various industrywide enforcement initiatives education programs and legislative activity around the world

inventory working capital backlog manufacturing and suppliers 

we manage inventory by communicating with our customers prior to the release of our products and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct and territorybyterritory basis historically we have experienced high turnover of our products and the lead times on reorders of our products are generally two to three weeks further as discussed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we have practices in place with our customers such as price protection that reduce product returns 

we typically ship orders immediately upon receipt of the order to the extent that any backlog may or may not exist at the end of a reporting period it would be an unreliable indicator of future results of any period 

in many instances we are able to acquire materials on a volumediscount basis we have multiple potential sources of supply for most materials except for the disk or cartridge component of our playstation 3 playstation 2 psp wii and nintendo ds and 3ds products

our business is highly seasonal with the highest levels of consumer demand and a significant percentage of our sales occurring in the holiday season quarter ending in december and a seasonal low in sales volume in the quarter ending in june while our sales generally follow this seasonal trend there can be no assurance that this trend will continue in addition we defer the recognition of a significant amount of net revenue related to our onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content over an extended period of time generally six months as a result the quarter in which we generate the highest sales volume may be different than the quarter in which we recognize the highest amount of net revenue our results can also vary based on a number of factors including title release dates cancellation or delay of a key event or sports season to which our product release schedule is tied consumer demand for our products shipment schedules and our revenue recognition policies 

employees 

as of march 31 2011 we had approximately 7600 regular fulltime employees over 4500 of whom were outside the united states we believe that our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is a critical factor in the successful development of our products and that our future success will depend in large measure on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees approximately 3 percent of our employees all of whom work for dice our swedish development studio are represented by a union

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs our business and financial performance could be harmed our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may harm our business and financial performance 

our business is intensely competitive and “hit” driven if we do not deliver “hit” products and services or if consumers prefer our competitors’ products or services over our own our operating results could suffer 

competition in our industry is intense and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge throughout the world our competitors range from large established companies to emerging startups in our industry though many new products and services are regularly introduced only a relatively small number of “hit” titles accounts for a significant portion of total revenue for the industry we have significantly reduced the number of games that we develop publish and distribute in fiscal year 2010 we published 54 primary titles and in fiscal year 2011 we published 36 in fiscal year 2012 we expect to release approximately 22 primary titles including launching our massively – multiplayer online roleplaying game star wars the old republic  publishing fewer titles means that we concentrate more of our development spending on each title and driving “hit” titles often requires large marketing budgets and media spend the underperformance of a title may have a large adverse impact on our financial results also hit products or services offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause revenue generated from our products and services to fall below expectations 

in addition both the online and mobile games marketplaces are characterized by frequent product introductions relatively low barriers to entry and new and evolving business methods technologies and platforms for development we expect competition in these markets to intensify it is also possible that consumer adoption of these new platforms for games and other technological advances in online or mobile game offerings could negatively impact our sales of console handheld and traditional pc products before we have sufficiently developed profitable businesses in these markets if our competitors develop and market more successful products or services offer competitive products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering a better value proposition such as freetoplay or subscriptionbased models or if we do not continue to develop consistently highquality and wellreceived products and services our revenue margins and profitability will decline 

our operating results will be adversely affected if we do not consistently meet our product development schedules or if key events or sports seasons that we tie our product release schedules to are delayed or cancelled 

our business is highly seasonal with the highest levels of consumer demand and a significant percentage of our sales occurring in the december quarter if we miss these key selling periods for any reason including product delays product cancellations or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have developed products our sales will suffer disproportionately our ability to meet product development schedules is affected by a number of factors including the creative processes involved the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams required by the increasing complexity of our products and the platforms for which they are developed and the need to finetune our products prior to their release we have experienced development delays for our products in the past which caused us to push back or cancel release dates we also seek to release certain products in conjunction with specific events such as the beginning of a sports season or major sporting event or the release of a related movie if a key event or sports season to which our product release schedule is tied were to be delayed or cancelled our sales would also suffer disproportionately in the future any failure to meet anticipated production or release schedules would likely result in a delay of revenue andor possibly a significant shortfall in our revenue increase our development expense harm our profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different than anticipated 

  

if our marketing and advertising efforts fail to resonate with our customers our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs such as television and online advertising print advertising retail merchandising website development and event sponsorship our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part upon the success of these programs if the marketing for our products and services fail to resonate with our customers particularly during the critical holiday season or during other key selling periods or if advertising rates or other media placement costs increase these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

our business is highly dependent on the success and availability of video game hardware systems manufactured by third parties as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products for these systems 

we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play on video game hardware systems which we also refer to as “platforms” manufactured by third parties such as sony’s playstation 3 microsoft’s xbox 360 and nintendo’s wii the success of our business is driven in large part by the commercial success and adequate supply of these video game hardware systems our ability to accurately predict which systems will be successful in the marketplace and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these systems we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of anticipated product ship dates a platform for which we are developing products may not succeed or may have a shorter life cycle than anticipated if consumer demand for the systems for which we are developing products is lower than our expectations our revenue will suffer we may be unable to fully recover the investments we have made in developing our products and our financial performance will be harmed alternatively a system for which we have not devoted significant resources could be more successful than we had initially anticipated causing us to miss out on meaningful revenue opportunities 

our adoption of new business models could fail to produce our desired financial returns 

we are actively seeking to monetize game properties through a variety of new platforms and business models including online distribution of full games and additional content freetoplay games supported by advertising andor microtransactions on social networking services and subscription services forecasting our revenues and profitability for these new business models is inherently uncertain and volatile our actual revenues and profits for these businesses may be significantly greater or less than our forecasts additionally these new business models could fail for one or more of our titles resulting in the loss of our investment in the development and infrastructure needed to support these new business models and the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from more successful businesses 

technology changes rapidly in our business and if we fail to anticipate or successfully develop games for new platforms and services adopt new distribution technologies or methods or implement new technologies in our games the quality timeliness and competitiveness of our products and services will suffer 

rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate sometimes years in advance which technologies we must implement and take advantage of in order to make our products and services competitive in the market we have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies technologies products and services such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the technology we choose to adopt and the platforms products and services that we pursue will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

our product development usually starts with particular platforms and distribution methods in mind and a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve we may not be able to achieve these goals or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly and effectively than we can in either case our products and services may be technologically inferior to our competitors’ less appealing to consumers or both if we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule of our products and services then we may delay their release until these technology goals can be achieved which may delay or reduce revenue 

  

   

and increase our development expenses alternatively we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies either to preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up with our competition which would increase our development expenses we may also miss opportunities to adopt technology or develop products and services for new platforms or services that become popular with consumers which could adversely affect our revenues it may take significant time and resources to shift our focus to such technologies or platforms putting us at a competitive disadvantage 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain adequate operational services and supporting infrastructure 

as we increase our online products and services we expect to continue to invest in technology services hardware and software — including data centers network services storage and database technologies — to support existing services and to introduce new products and services including websites ecommerce capabilities online game communities and online game play services creating the appropriate support for online business initiatives is expensive and complex and could result in inefficiencies or operational failures and increased vulnerability to cyber attacks which could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience such failures could result in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers which could harm our business in addition we could be adversely impacted by outages and disruptions in the online platforms of our key business partners who offer our products and services 

if we release defective products our operating results could suffer 

products such as ours are extremely complex software programs and are difficult to develop manufacture and distribute we have quality controls in place to detect defects in the software media and packaging of our products before they are released nonetheless these quality controls are subject to human error overriding and reasonable resource constraints therefore these quality controls and preventative measures may not be effective in detecting defects in our products before they have been reproduced and released into the marketplace in such an event we could be required to or may find it necessary to voluntarily recall a product or suspend its availability which could significantly harm our business and operating results 

our business could be adversely affected if our consumer data protection measures are not seen as adequate there are breaches of our security measures or unintended disclosures of our consumer data 

there are several inherent risks to engaging in business online and directly with end consumers of our products as we conduct more transactions online directly with consumers we may be the victim of fraudulent transactions including credit card fraud which presents a risk to our revenues and potentially disrupts service to our consumers in addition we are collecting and storing more consumer information including personal information and credit card information we take measures to protect our consumer data from unauthorized access or disclosure it is possible that our security controls over consumer data may not prevent the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information a security breach that leads to disclosure of consumer account information including personally identifiable information could harm our reputation compel us to comply with disparate state breach notification laws and otherwise subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue a resulting perception that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could result in a loss of current or potential consumers for our online offerings that require the collection of consumer data our key business partners also face these same risks and any security breaches of their system could adversely impact our ability to offer our products and services through their platforms resulting in a loss of meaningful revenues 

in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain contradictory and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so this could result in government imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

  

the majority of our sales are made to a relatively small number of key customers if these customers reduce their purchases of our products or become unable to pay for them our business could be harmed 

during the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 approximately 72 percent of our north america sales were made to our top ten customers in europe our top ten customers accounted for approximately 46 percent of our sales in that territory during the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 worldwide we had direct sales to two customers gamestop corp and walmart stores inc which represented approximately 16 percent and 10 percent of total net revenue respectively for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 though our products are available to consumers through a variety of retailers and directly through us the concentration of our sales in one or a few large customers could lead to a shortterm disruption in our sales if one or more of these customers significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to carry our products and could make us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers became unable to pay for our products or declared bankruptcy additionally our receivables from these large customers increase significantly in the december quarter as they make purchases in anticipation of the holiday selling season also having such a large portion of our total net revenue concentrated in a few customers could reduce our negotiating leverage with these customers if one or more of our key customers experience deterioration in their business or become unable to obtain sufficient financing to maintain their operations our business could be harmed 

our industry is cyclical driven by the periodic introduction of new video game hardware systems as we continue to move through the current cycle our industry growth may slow down and as a result our operating results may be difficult to predict 

video game hardware systems have historically had a life cycle of four to six years which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well the current cycle began with microsoft’s launch of the xbox 360 in 2005 and continued in 2006 when sony and nintendo launched their nextgeneration systems the playstation 3 and the wii respectively sales of software designed for these hardware systems represent the majority of our revenue so our growth and success is highly correlated to sales of video game hardware systems while there are indications that this current cycle may be extended longer than prior cycles — in part due to the growth of online services and content the greater graphic and processing power of the current generation hardware and the introduction of new peripherals — growth in the installed base of the current generation of video game systems is likely to slow down in the coming years this slowdown in sales of video game players may cause a corresponding slowdown in the growth of sales of video game software which could significantly affect our operating results 

sales of used video game products could lower our sales of new video games 

certain of our retail customers sell used video games used video game sales have been growing in north america and are emerging in europe used video games are generally priced lower than new video games and the margins on used games sales are generally greater for retailers than the margins on new game sales we do not receive revenue from retailers’ sales of used video games sales of used video games may negatively impact our sales and profitability 

the video game hardware manufacturers are among our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of andor access to our video game products if they do not approve our products we will be unable to ship to our customers 

our agreements with hardware licensors such as sony for the playstation 3 microsoft for the xbox 360 and nintendo for the wii typically give significant control to the licensor over the approval and manufacturing of our products which could in certain circumstances leave us unable to get our products approved manufactured and shipped to customers these hardware licensors are also among our chief competitors generally control of the approval and manufacturing process by the hardware licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently while we believe that our relationships with our hardware licensors are currently good the potential for these licensors to delay or refuse to approve or manufacture our products exists such occurrences would harm our business and our financial performance 

  

   

we also require compatibility code and the consent of sony microsoft and nintendo in order to include online capabilities in our products for their respective platforms and to digitally distribute our products through their proprietary networks as online capabilities for video game systems become more significant sony microsoft and nintendo could restrict the manner in which we provide online capabilities for our products they may also restrict the number of products that we may distribute digitally on their networks if sony microsoft or nintendo refuse to approve our products with online capabilities restrict our digital download offerings on their proprietary networks or significantly impact the financial terms on which these services are offered to our customers our business could be harmed 

the video game hardware manufacturers set the royalty rates and other fees that we must pay to publish games for their platforms and therefore have significant influence on our costs if one or more of these manufacturers change their fee structure our profitability will be materially impacted 

in order to publish products for a video game system such as the xbox 360 playstation 3 or wii we must take a license from microsoft sony and nintendo respectively which gives these companies the opportunity to set the fee structure that we must pay in order to publish games for that platform similarly these companies have retained the flexibility to change their fee structures or adopt different fee structures for online purchases of games online gameplay and other new features for their consoles the control that hardware manufacturers have over the fee structures for their platforms and online access could adversely impact our costs profitability and margins because publishing products for video game systems is the largest portion of our business any increase in fee structures would significantly harm our ability to generate profits 

if we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to include intellectual property owned by others in our games or to maintain or acquire the rights to publish or distribute games developed by others we will sell fewer hit titles and our revenue profitability and cash flows will decline competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and reduce our profitability 

many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our ea sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players’ associations similarly many of our other hit franchises such as harry potter are based on key film and literary licenses and our hasbro products are based on a license for these key toy and game properties in addition some of our successful products in fiscal year 2011 bulletstorm and crysis 2 were products for which we acquired publishing rights through a license from the product’s creatorowner competition for these licenses and rights is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses and rights or obtain additional licenses or rights with significant commercial value our revenues profitability and cash flows will decline significantly competition for these licenses may also drive up the advances guarantees and royalties that we must pay to licensors and developers which could significantly increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

if we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel we will be unable to effectively conduct our business 

the market for technical creative marketing and other personnel essential to the development and marketing of our products and management of our businesses is extremely competitive our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of executives and key creative talent if we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need or replace key employees following their departure our ability to develop and manage our business will be impaired 

our business is subject to risks generally associated with the entertainment industry any of which could significantly harm our operating results 

our business is subject to risks that are generally associated with the entertainment industry many of which are beyond our control these risks could negatively impact our operating results and include the popularity price and timing of our games and the platforms on which they are played economic conditions that adversely affect discretionary consumer spending changes in consumer demographics the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted 

  

acquisitions investments and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties dilution to our investors and other negative consequences 

we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into other strategic transactions including 1 acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets 2 minority investments in strategic partners and 3 investments in new interactive entertainment businesses for example online and mobile publishing platforms as part of our longterm business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment that we acquire unknown liabilities or that we experience difficulty in the integration of business systems and technologies the integration and retention of new employees or in the maintenance of key business and customer relationships of the businesses we acquire or diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses these events could harm our operating results or financial condition 

future acquisitions and investments could also involve the issuance of our equity and equitylinked securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses such as stockbased compensation any of the foregoing factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating performance that could have otherwise been achieved by us on a standalone basis our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights which could harm our business 

from time to time third parties may assert claims against us relating to patents copyrights trademarks personal publicity rights or other intellectual property rights to technologies products or deliverypayment methods that are important to our business although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement for example we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from certain individuals and companies who have acquired patent portfolios for the sole purpose of asserting such claims against other companies in addition many of our products are highly realistic and feature materials that are based on real world examples which may be the subject of intellectual property infringement claims of others from time to time we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims existing or future infringement claims against us whether valid or not may be time consuming and expensive to defend such claims or litigations could require us to pay damages and other costs stop selling the affected products redesign those products to avoid infringement or obtain a license all of which could be costly and harm our business in addition many patents have been issued that may apply to potential new modes of delivering playing or monetizing game software products and services such as those that we produce or would like to offer in the future we may discover that future opportunities to provide new and innovative modes of game play and game delivery to consumers may be precluded by existing patents that we are unable to license on reasonable terms 

from time to time we may become involved in other legal proceedings which could adversely affect us 

we are currently and from time to time in the future may become subject to legal proceedings claims litigation and government investigations or inquiries which could be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations in addition the outcome of any legal proceedings claims litigation investigations or inquiries may be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

our business is subject to increasing regulation and the adoption of proposed legislation we oppose could negatively impact our business 

legislation is continually being introduced in the united states at the local state and federal levels for the establishment of government mandated rating requirements or restrictions on distribution of entertainment software based on content to date most courts that have ruled on such legislation have ruled in a manner favorable to the interactive entertainment industry other countries have adopted or are considering laws 

  

   

regulating or mandating ratings requirements on entertainment software content and certain foreign countries already allow government censorship of entertainment software products adoption of government ratings system or restrictions on distribution of entertainment software based on content could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers and compliance with new and possibly inconsistent regulations for different territories could be costly or delay the release of our products 

as we increase the online delivery of our products and services we are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet in addition laws and regulations relating to user privacy data collection and retention content advertising and information security have been adopted or are being considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation furthermore any failure on our part to comply with these laws or the application of these laws in an unanticipated manner may harm our business 

our products are subject to the threat of piracy and unauthorized copying 

we take measures to protect our prerelease software and other confidential information from unauthorized access a security breach that results in the disclosure of prerelease software or other confidential assets could lead or contribute to piracy of our games or otherwise compromise our product plans 

further entertainment software piracy is a persistent problem in our industry the growth in peertopeer networks and other channels to download pirated copies of our products the increasing availability of broadband access to the internet and the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures used with our products all have contributed to an expansion in piracy though we take technical steps to make the unauthorized copying of our products more difficult as do the manufacturers of consoles on which our games are played these efforts may not be successful in controlling the piracy of our products 

while legal protections exist to combat piracy preventing and curbing infringement through enforcement of our intellectual property rights may be difficult costly and time consuming particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights further the scope of the legal protection of copyright and prohibitions against the circumvention of technological protection measures to protect copyrighted works are often under scrutiny by courts and governing bodies the repeal or weakening of laws intended to combat piracy protect intellectual property and prohibit the circumvention of technological protection measures could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect against piracy these factors could have a negative effect on our growth and profitability in the future 

if one or more of our titles were found to contain hidden objectionable content our business could suffer 

throughout the history of our industry many video games have been designed to include certain hidden content and gameplay features that are accessible through the use of ingame cheat codes or other technological means that are intended to enhance the gameplay experience however in several cases hidden content or features have been found to be included in other publishers’ products by an employee who was not authorized to do so or by an outside developer without the knowledge of the publisher from time to time some hidden content and features have contained profanity graphic violence and sexually explicit or otherwise objectionable material in a few cases the entertainment software ratings board “esrb” has reacted to discoveries of hidden content and features by reviewing the rating that was originally assigned to the product requiring the publisher to change the game packaging andor fining the publisher retailers have on occasion reacted to the discovery of such hidden content by removing these games from their shelves refusing to sell them and demanding that their publishers accept them as product returns likewise consumers have reacted to the revelation of hidden content by refusing to purchase such games demanding refunds for games they have already purchased and refraining from buying other games published by the company whose game contained the objectionable material 

we have implemented preventative measures designed to reduce the possibility of hidden objectionable content from appearing in the video games we publish nonetheless these preventative measures are subject to human error circumvention overriding and reasonable resource constraints in addition to the extent we acquire a company without similar controls in place the possibility of hidden objectionable content appearing in video games developed by that company but for which we are ultimately responsible could increase if a video game 

  

we published were found to contain hidden objectionable content the esrb could demand that we recall a game and change its packaging to reflect a revised rating retailers could refuse to sell it and demand we accept the return of any unsold copies or returns from customers and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand that we refund their money this could have a material negative impact on our operating results and financial condition in addition our reputation could be harmed which could impact sales of other video games we sell if any of these consequences were to occur our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed 

uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

declines in consumer spending resulting from adverse changes in the economy have in the past negatively impacted our business further economic distress may result in a decrease in demand for our products particularly during key product launch windows which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could also increase the risk of material losses on our investments increase costs associated with developing and publishing our products increase the cost and decrease the availability of sources of financing and increase our exposure to material losses from bad debts any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results in addition if we experience further deterioration in our market capitalization or our financial performance we could be required to recognize significant impairment charges in future periods 

our business is subject to currency fluctuations 

international sales are a fundamental part of our business for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 international net revenue comprised 49 percent of our total net revenue we expect international sales to continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue such sales may be subject to unexpected regulatory requirements tariffs and other barriers additionally foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies which may fluctuate against the us dollar in addition our foreign investments and our cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies are subject to currency fluctuations we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate some foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily certain intercompany receivables and payables to a limited extent and foreign currency option contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions primarily related to a portion of the revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currency generated by our operational subsidiaries however these activities are limited in the protection they provide us from foreign currency fluctuations and can themselves result in losses in the past the disruption in the global financial markets has impacted many of the financial institutions with which we do business a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of the disruption in the financial markets could negatively impact our treasury operations including our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs accordingly our results of operations including our reported net revenue operating expenses and net income and financial condition can be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations especially the euro british pound sterling and canadian dollar 

volatility in the capital markets may adversely impact the value of our investments and could cause us to recognize significant impairment charges in our operating results 

our portfolio of shortterm investments and marketable equity securities is subject to volatility in the capital markets and to national and international economic conditions in particular our international investments can be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency and our shortterm investments are susceptible to changes in shortterm interest rates these investments are also impacted by declines in value attributable to the creditworthiness of the issuer from time to time we may liquidate some or all of our shortterm investments or marketable equity securities to fund operational needs or other activities such as capital expenditures strategic investments or business acquisitions or for other purposes if we were to liquidate these shortterm investments at a time when they were worth less than what we had originally purchased them for or if the obligor were unable to pay the full amount at maturity we could incur a significant loss similarly we hold marketable equity securities which have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by price and trading volume volatility in the public stock 

  

   

markets we could be required to recognize impairment charges on the securities held by us andor we may realize losses on the sale of these securities all of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 

we are also required to estimate what our tax obligations will be in the future although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the estimation process and applicable laws are inherently uncertain and our estimates are not binding on tax authorities the tax laws’ treatment of software and internetbased transactions is particularly uncertain and in some cases currently applicable tax laws are illsuited to address these kinds of transactions apart from an adverse resolution of these uncertainties our effective tax rate also could be adversely affected by our profit level by changes in our business or changes in our structure resulting from the reorganization of our business and operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the elections we make changes in applicable tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions or changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as well as other factors in fiscal years 2009 2010 and 2011 we recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggest that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized further our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should our ultimate tax liability exceed our estimates our income tax provision and net income or loss could be materially affected 

we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our consolidated pretax income or loss as a result in absolute dollar terms our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pretax income or loss than at higher levels in addition at lower levels of pretax income or loss our effective tax rate will be more volatile 

we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under examination by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations changes in our business or changes in applicable tax rules will not have an adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition 

furthermore as we expand our international operations adopt new products and new distribution models implement changes to our operating structure or undertake intercompany transactions in light of changing tax laws expiring rulings acquisitions and our current and anticipated business and operational requirements our tax expense could increase 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves 

our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting policies promulgated by the securities and exchange commission “sec” and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies policies affecting software revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products and services we recognize all of the revenue from bundled sales  ie  packaged goods video games that include an online service component on a deferred basis over an estimated online service period which we generally estimate to be six months beginning in the month after shipment as we increase our downloadable content and add new features to our online service our estimate of the online service period may change and we could be required to recognize 

  

revenue over a longer period of time we expect that a significant portion of our games will be onlineenabled in the future and we could be required to recognize the related revenue over an extended period of time rather than at the time of sale as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue and taxes could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

we have begun the implementation of a new integrated financial information system to be used throughout our worldwide organization if this implementation is not completed in a successful and timely manner or if the new system fails to perform as expected our ability to accurately process prepare and analyze important financial data could be impeded and our business operations may be disrupted 

as part of our effort to improve efficiencies throughout our worldwide organization we have begun the implementation of a new integrated financial information system this implementation is expected to be completed by january 2012 this system will integrate our order management product shipment cash management and financial accounting processes among others the successful conversion from our current multiple financial information systems to this new integrated financial information system entails a number of risks due to the complexity of the conversion and implementation process such risks include verifying the accuracy of the business data and information prior to conversion the actual conversion of that data and information to the new system and then using that business data and information in the new system after the conversion while testing of these new systems and processes and training of employees are done in advance of implementation there are inherent limitations in our ability to simulate a fullscale operating environment in advance of implementation there can be no assurance that the conversion to and the implementation of the new financial information system will not impede our ability to accurately and timely process prepare and analyze the financial data we use in making operating decisions and which form the basis of the financial information we include in the periodic reports we file with the sec in addition a number of important operational functions including receiving product orders product shipments and inventory maintenance among others will be reliant on the new system and therefore any problems with the implementation or other system problems may result in a disruption to our business operations 

we rely on business partners in many areas of our business and our business may be harmed if they are unable to honor their obligations to us 

we rely on various business partners including thirdparty service providers vendors licensing partners development partners and licensees among others in many areas of our business in many cases these third parties are given access to sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support to our teams these third parties may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it the failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies or the failure of the third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies could result in a disruption to our business operations further the disruption in the financial markets and the global economic downturn may adversely affect our business partners and they may not be able to continue honoring their obligations to us some of our business partners are highlyleveraged or small businesses that may be particularly vulnerable in the current economic environment alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner or vendor if we lose one or more significant business partners our business could be harmed 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors above as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts’ earnings estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts’ and investors’ expectations to factors affecting the entertainment computer software internet media or electronics industries to our ability to successfully integrate any acquisitions we may make or to national or international economic conditions in particular economic 

  

   

downturns may contribute to the public stock markets experiencing extreme price and trading volume volatility these broad market fluctuations have and could continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

in february 2011 we announced that our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 600 million of our common stock over the next 18 months our stock repurchases may be executed at market prices that may subsequently decline

about electronic arts 

we develop market publish and distribute game software and content that can be played by consumers on a variety of platforms including video game consoles such as the sony playstation 3 microsoft xbox 360 and nintendo wii personal computers mobile phones such as the apple iphone and google android compatible phones tablets and electronic readers such as the apple ipad and amazon kindle the internet and handheld game players such as the playstation portable “psp” and the nintendo ds and 3ds some of our games are based on content that we license from others  eg  fifa madden nfl harry potter and hasbro’s toy and game intellectual properties and some of our games are based on our own whollyowned intellectual property  eg  the sims need for speed and dead space our goal is to publish titles with global massmarket appeal which often means translating and localizing them for sale in nonenglish speaking countries in addition we also attempt to create software game “franchises” that allow us to publish new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the same property examples of this franchise approach are the annual iterations of our sportsbased products  eg  fifa madden nfl and ncaa football whollyowned properties that can be successfully sequeled  eg  the sims need for speed and battlefield and titles based on longlived literary andor movie properties  eg  harry potter 

financial results 

total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 was 3589 million down 65 million as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 at march 31 2011 deferred net revenue associated with sales of onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content increased by 239 million as compared to march 31 2010 directly reducing the amount of reported net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 at march 31 2010 deferred net revenue associated with sales of onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content increased by 505 million as compared to march 31 2009 directly reducing the amount of reported net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 without these changes in deferred net revenue reported net revenue would have decreased by approximately 331 million during fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 net revenue for fiscal year 2011 was driven by fifa 11 battlefield bad company 2 and madden nfl 11  

net loss for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 was 276 million as compared to a net loss of 677 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 diluted loss per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 was 084 as compared to a diluted loss per share of 208 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 net loss decreased for fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 primarily as a result of 1 a 302 million increase in gross profit due to a decrease in the change in deferred net revenue related to certain onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content and a greater percentage of net revenue from ea studio and digital products which have higher margins than our copublishing and distribution products 2 a 76 million decrease in research and development costs and 3 a 49 million increase in our gains losses on strategic investments net these decreases were partially offset by 1 a 26 million decrease in the benefit from income taxes and 2 an increase of 21 million in restructuring and other charges primarily from our fiscal 2011 restructuring 

during fiscal year 2011 we generated 320 million of cash from operating activities as compared to generating 152 million in fiscal year 2010 the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to 1 a greater percentage of net revenue from ea studio and 

  

   

digital products which have higher margins than our copublishing and distribution products 2 the timing of payments related to our inventory purchases 3 our cost reduction initiatives including decreases in external development and contracted services and 4 lower marketing and advertising spend as a result of a decrease in the number of titles released as compared to the prior year 

trends in our business 

digital content distribution and services  consumers are spending an everincreasing portion of their money and time on interactive entertainment that is accessible online or through mobile digital devices such as smart phones or through social networks such as facebook we provide a variety of onlinedelivered products and services many of our games that are available as packaged goods products are also available through direct online download through the internet we also offer onlinedelivered content and services that are addons or related to our packaged goods products such as additional game content or enhancements of multiplayer services further we provide other games content and services that are available only via electronic delivery such as internetonly games and game services and games for mobile devices 

advances in mobile technology have resulted in a variety of new and evolving devices that are being used to play games by an everbroadening base of consumers we have responded to these advances in technology and consumer acceptance of digital distribution by offering different sales models such as subscription services online downloads for a onetime fee and advertisingsupported freetoplay games and game sites in addition we offer our consumers the ability to play a game across platforms on multiple devices we significantly increased the revenues that we derive from onlinedelivered products and services from 432 million in fiscal year 2009 to 522 million in fiscal year 2010 and 743 million in fiscal year 2011 and we expect this portion of our business to continue to grow in fiscal 2012 and beyond 

wireless and other emerging platforms advances in technology have resulted in a variety of platforms for interactive entertainment examples include wireless technologies streaming gaming services and internetconnected televisions our efforts in wireless interactive entertainment are focused in two areas – games for handheld game systems and downloadable games for mobile devices these platforms grow the consumer base for our business while also providing competition to existing established video game platforms we expect sales of games for wireless and other emerging platforms to continue to be an important part of our business 

concentration of sales among the most popular games  we see a larger portion of packaged goods games sales concentrated on the most popular titles and that those titles are typically sequels of prior games we have responded to this trend by significantly reducing the number of games that we produce to provide greater focus on our most promising intellectual properties from 67 primary titles in fiscal year 2009 to 54 in fiscal year 2010 and 36 primary titles in fiscal year 2011 in fiscal year 2012 we expect to release approximately 22 primary titles consequently we have decreased the number of games that we distribute which have lower margins as well as reduced our exposure to the declining music games genre 

catalog sales  the video game industry is experiencing a change in retail sales patterns which is decreasing revenue from catalog sales sales of games in the periods following the launch quarter currently many console games experience sales cycles that are shorter than in the past to mitigate this trend we offer our consumers a directtoconsumer service such as “headtohead” play or other multiplayer options andor additional content available through online services to further enhance the gaming experience and extend the time that consumers play our games after their initial purchase we anticipate that in some cases these additional online services will also generate revenue to mitigate the effect of reduced catalog sales 

used games  some retailers sell used video games which are generally priced lower than new video games and do not result in revenue to the publisher of the games from the sale we have observed that the market for used video games has been growing if retailers continue to increase their sales of used video games it could negatively affect our sales of new video games and have an adverse impact on our operating results 

  

recent developments 

stock repurchase program in february 2011 we announced that our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 600 million of our common stock over the next 18 months as of march 31 2011 we had repurchased 58 million of our common stock or approximately 3 million shares in the open market since the commencement of the program including pursuant to a prearranged stock trading plan 

under the program we may purchase stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws including pursuant to prearranged stock trading plans the timing and actual amount of the stock repurchases will depend on several factors including price capital availability regulatory requirements alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions we are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares under the program and the repurchase program may be modified suspended or discontinued at any time 

fiscal 2011 restructuring in fiscal year 2011 we announced a plan focused on the restructuring of certain licensing and developer agreements in an effort to improve the longterm profitability of our packaged goods business under this plan we amended certain licensing and developer agreements to a much lesser extent as part of this restructuring we had workforce reductions and facilities closures through march 31 2011 substantially all of these exit activities were completed by march 31 2011 

since the inception of the fiscal 2011 restructuring plan through march 31 2011 we have incurred charges of 148 million consisting of 1 104 million related to the amendment of certain licensing agreements and other intangible asset impairment costs 2 31 million related to the amendment of certain developer agreements and 3 13 million in employeerelated expenses in fiscal year 2012 we anticipate incurring less than 10 million of restructuring and other charges related to the fiscal 2011 restructuring primarily interest expense accretion 

sale of ubisoft investment we purchased approximately 199 percent of the thenoutstanding ordinary shares representing approximately 18 percent of the voting rights at the time of ubisoft entertainment “ubisoft” in february 2005 for 91 million in july 2010 we sold our investment in ubisoft for approximately 121 million and realized a gain of 28 million net of costs to sell 

international operations and foreign currency exchange impact international sales revenue derived from countries other than canada and the united states are a fundamental part of our business net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately 49 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2011 and approximately 45 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2010 our net revenue is impacted by foreign exchange rates during the reporting period associated with net revenue before revenue deferral as well as the foreign exchange rates associated with the recognition of deferred net revenue of onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content that were established at the time we recorded this deferred net revenue on our consolidated balance sheets the foreign exchange rates during the reporting period may not always move in the same direction as the foreign exchange rate impact associated with the recognition of deferred net revenue of onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content during the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 foreign exchange rates had an overall unfavorable impact on our net revenue of approximately 71 million or 2 percent in addition our international investments and our cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates if the us dollar strengthens against these currencies then foreign exchange rates may have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations and our financial condition 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities contingent assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown as a result actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

  

   

revenue recognition sales returns allowances and bad debt reserves 

we derive revenue principally from sales of interactive software games 1 on video game consoles such as the playstation 3 xbox 360 and wii pcs and handheld game players such as the psp and nintendo ds and 3ds 2 on mobile devices such as cellular and smart phones including the apple iphone 3 on tablets such as the apple ipad and 4 from software products and content and online services associated with these products we evaluate revenue recognition based on the criteria set forth in financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” 985605 software revenue recognition  and staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 104 revenue recognition  we evaluate and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met 

 

  

  

  

 determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and management judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report in each period for example for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to 1 determine whether and when each element has been delivered 2 determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services 3 determine whether vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” exists for each undelivered element and 4 allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver changes to any of these assumptions or management judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

depending on the type of product we may offer an online service that permits consumers to play against others via the internet andor receive additional updates or content from us for those games that consumers can play via the internet we may provide a “matchmaking” service that permits consumers to connect with other consumers to play against each other online in those situations where we do not require an additional fee for this online service we account for the sale of the software product and the online service as a “bundled” sale or multiple element arrangement in which we sell both the software product and the online service for one combined price we defer net revenue from sales of these games for which we do not have vsoe for the online service that we provided in connection with the sale and recognize the revenue from these games over the estimated online service period which is generally estimated to be six months beginning in the month after shipment in addition for some software products we also provide updates or additional content “digital content” to be delivered via the internet that can be used with the original software product in many cases we separately sell digital content for an additional fee however some purchased digital content can only be accessed via the internet  ie  the consumer never takes possession of the digital content we account for online transactions in which the consumer does not take possession of the digital content as a service transaction and accordingly we recognize the associated revenue over the estimated service period in other transactions at the date we sell the software product we have an obligation to provide incremental unspecified digital content in the future without an additional fee in these cases we account for the sale of the software product as a multiple element arrangement and recognize the revenue on a straightline basis over the estimated period of game play 

  

determining whether a transaction constitutes an online service transaction or a digital content download of a product requires judgment and can be difficult the accounting for these transactions is significantly different revenue from product downloads is generally recognized when the download is made available assuming all other recognition criteria are met revenue from an online game service is recognized as the service is rendered if the service period is not defined we recognize the revenue over the estimated service period determining the estimated service period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage in addition determining whether we have an implicit obligation to provide incremental unspecified future digital content without an additional fee can be difficult 

product revenue including sales to resellers and distributors “channel partners” is recognized when the above four criteria are met we reduce product revenue for estimated future returns price protection and other offerings which may occur with our customers and channel partners price protection represents the right to receive a credit allowance in the event we lower our wholesale price on a particular product the amount of the price protection is generally the difference between the old price and the new price in certain countries we have stockbalancing programs for our pc and video game system software products which allow for the exchange of these software products by resellers under certain circumstances it is our general practice to exchange software products or give credits rather than to give cash refunds 

in certain countries from time to time we decide to provide price protection for our software products when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances we analyze historical returns current sellthrough of distributor and retailer inventory of our software products current trends in retail and the video game industry changes in customer demand and acceptance of our software products and other related factors in addition we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods 

in the future actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold software products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms product updates or competing software products while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters these estimates are inherently subjective accordingly if our estimates change our returns and price protection reserves would change which would impact the total net revenue we report for example if actual returns andor price protection were significantly greater than the reserves we have established our actual results would decrease our reported total net revenue conversely if actual returns andor price protection were significantly less than our reserves this would increase our reported total net revenue in addition if our estimates of returns and price protection related to onlineenabled packaged goods software products change the amount of deferred net revenue we recognize in the future would change 

significant management judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends and historical experience depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly 

fair value estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item in order to fairly present our financial statements without an independent market or another representative transaction determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the accounting 

there are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value these include 1 the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value 2 the 

  

   

income approach which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example future cash flows or future earnings to a single present value amount and 3 the cost approach which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset for many of our fair value estimates including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets and acquired inprocess technology we use the income approach using the income approach requires the use of financial models which require us to make various estimates including but not limited to 1 the potential future cash flows for the asset or liability being measured 2 the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows 3 the time value of money associated with the expected receipt or payment of such cash flows and 4 the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium making these cash flow estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate our financial results may be negatively impacted furthermore relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact to the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached for example a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired 

while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions the following areas are the most sensitive to these assessments 

business combinations  we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities and contingencies assumed acquired inprocess technology and contingent consideration issued in a business combination our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets and acquired inprocess technology are amortized over various estimated useful lives furthermore a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount we recognize as goodwill an asset that is not amortized determining the fair value of assets acquired requires an assessment of the highest and best use or the expected price to sell the asset and the related expected future cash flows determining the fair value of acquired inprocess technology also requires an assessment of our expectations related to the use of that asset determining the fair value of an assumed liability requires an assessment of the expected cost to transfer the liability determining the fair value of contingent consideration issued requires an assessment of the expected future cash flows over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled and applying a discount rate that appropriately captures a market participant’s view of the risk associated with the obligation this fair value assessment is also required in periods subsequent to a business combination such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

assessment of impairment of goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets current accounting standards require that we assess the recoverability of our finite lived acquisitionrelated intangible assets and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets is potentially impaired in order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred management must make various assumptions about the estimated fair value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated future cash flows for some assets our estimated fair value is dependent upon predicting which of our products will be successful this success is dependent upon several factors which are beyond our control such as which operating platforms will be successful in the marketplace also our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules 

we are required to perform a twostep approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount our reporting units are determined by the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which 1 discrete financial information is available and 2 segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component we are required to perform the impairment test at least annually by applying a fair valuebased test the first step measures for impairment by applying fair valuebased tests at the reporting unit level the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 

to determine the fair value of each reporting unit used in the first step we use a combination of the market approach which utilizes comparable companies’ data andor the income approach which utilizes discounted 

  

cash flows determining whether an event or change in circumstances does or does not indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount is inherently subjective each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include longterm growth rates tax rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables these estimates and assumptions have to be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment as of the last annual assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 we concluded that the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units adequately exceeded their carrying amounts and we have not identified any indicators of impairment since our estimates for market growth our market share and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and certain external sources and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business our business consists of developing marketing and distributing video game software using both established and emerging intellectual properties and our forecasts for emerging intellectual properties are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information and have an inherently higher risk of accuracy if future forecasts are revised they may indicate or require future impairment charges we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

assessment of impairment of shortterm investments and marketable equity securities we periodically review our shortterm investments and marketable equity securities for impairment our shortterm investments consist of securities with remaining maturities greater than three months at the time of purchase and our marketable equity securities consist of investments in common stock of publicly traded companies both are accounted for as availableforsale securities unrealized gains and losses on our shortterm investments and marketable equity securities are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity net of tax until either 1 the security is sold 2 the security has matured or 3 we determine that the fair value of the security has declined below its adjusted cost basis and the decline is otherthantemporary realized gains and losses on our shortterm investments and marketable equity securities are calculated based on the specific identification method and are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income net and gains losses on strategic investments net respectively determining whether the decline in fair value is otherthantemporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each security the ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge including the credit quality of the issuer the duration that the fair value has been less than the adjusted cost basis severity of the impairment reason for the decline in value and potential recovery period the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the investees and our intent to sell and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value any contractual terms impacting the prepayment or settlement process as well as if we would be required to sell an investment due to liquidity or contractual reasons before its anticipated recovery our ongoing consideration of these factors could result in impairment charges in the future which could have a material impact on our financial results 

assessment of inventory obsolescence we regularly review inventory quantities onhand we write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products inventory writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market value based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently difficult to assess at the point of a loss recognition a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

stockbased compensation 

we are required to estimate the fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant we recognize compensation costs for stockbased payment awards to employees based on the grantdate fair value using a straightline approach over the service period for which such awards are expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock is determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock on 

  

   

the date of grant the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and our 2000 employee stock purchase plan respectively is determined using the blackscholes valuation model the determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding subjective and complex variables such as expected employee exercise behavior and our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award generally our assumptions are based on historical information and judgment is required to determine if historical trends may be indicators of future outcomes the key assumptions for the blackscholes valuation calculation are 

 

  

  

  

 employee stockbased compensation expense is calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures forfeitures are revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates and an adjustment to stockbased compensation expense will be recognized at that time 

changes to our assumptions used in the blackscholes option valuation calculation and our forfeiture rate as well as future equity granted or assumed through acquisitions could significantly impact the compensation expense we recognize 

royalties and licenses 

our royalty expenses consist of payments to 1 content licensors 2 independent software developers and 3 copublishing and distribution affiliates license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities professional sports organizations movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks copyrights personal publicity rights content andor other intellectual property royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games copublishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of products 

royaltybased obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid these royaltybased obligations are generally expensed to cost of goods sold generally at the greater of the contractual rate for contracts with guaranteed minimums or an effective royalty rate based on the total projected net revenue significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors including 1 the total number of titles subject to the contract 2 the timing of the release of these titles 3 the number of software units we expect to sell which can be impacted by a number of variables including product quality the timing of the title’s release and competition and 4 future pricing determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products accordingly if our future revenue projections change our effective royalty rates would change which could impact the amount and timing of royalty expense we recognize 

prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and copublishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product and therefore we are generally 

  

subject to development risk prior to the release of the product accordingly payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred payments due after completion of the product primarily royaltybased in nature are generally expensed as cost of goods sold 

our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor when performance remains with the licensor we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract royalty liabilities are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next 12 months 

each quarter we also evaluate the expected future realization of our royaltybased assets as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales any impairments or losses determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense impairments or losses determined postlaunch are charged to cost of goods sold we evaluate longlived royaltybased assets for impairment generally using undiscounted cash flows when impairment indicators exist unrecognized minimum royaltybased commitments are accounted for as executory contracts and therefore any losses on these commitments are recognized when the underlying intellectual property is abandoned  ie  cease use or the contractual rights to use the intellectual property are terminated 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carry forwards we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified it is generally difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is significant negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years forecasts of future taxable income are considered to be less objective than past results particularly in light of the economic environment therefore cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 

in addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities the carry back of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law and the implementation of tax planning strategies evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence this evaluation involves assumptions about future activity certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets 

based on the assumptions and requirements noted above we have recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets in addition we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggest that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized 

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate these estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation as well as with respect to other matters such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to 

  

   

our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities the ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations in addition changes in our business including acquisitions changes in our international corporate structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix and amount of income as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities valuation allowances applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate 

we historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly no us taxes have been provided thereon we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states

net revenue 

net revenue consists of sales generated from 1 video games sold as packaged goods and designed for play on hardware consoles such as the playstation 3 xbox 360 and wii pcs and handheld game players such as the sony psp and nintendo ds and 3ds 2 video games for mobile devices such as cellular and smart phones including the apple iphone 3 video games for tablets such as the apple ipad 4 software products and content and online services associated with these products 5 programming thirdparty websites with our game content 6 allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products and 7 advertisements on our online web pages and in our games 

net revenue before revenue deferral a nongaap financial measure is provided in this section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” see “nongaap financial measures” below for an explanation of our use of this nongaap measure a reconciliation to the corresponding measure calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states is provided in the discussion below 

“revenue deferral” in this “net revenue” section includes the unrecognized revenue from 1 bundled sales of certain onlineenabled packaged goods and pc digital downloads for which either we do not have vsoe for the online service that we provide in connection with the sale of the software or we have an obligation to provide future incremental unspecified digital content 2 certain packaged goods sales of massivelymultiplayer online roleplaying games and 3 sales of certain incremental digital content associated with our games which are types of “microtransactions” fluctuations in the revenue deferral are largely dependent upon the amounts of products that we sell with the online features and services previously discussed while the recognition of revenue deferral for a period is also dependent upon 1 the period of time the online features and services are to be provided and 2 the timing of the sale for example most revenue deferrals incurred in the first half of a fiscal year are recognized within the same fiscal year however substantially all of the revenue deferrals incurred in the last month of a fiscal year will be recognized in the subsequent fiscal year

nongaap financial measures 

net revenue before revenue deferral is a nongaap financial measure that excludes the impact of revenue deferral and the recognition of revenue deferral on net revenue related to packaged goods games and digital content we defer net revenue from sales of certain onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content for which we are not able to objectively determine the fair value as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states for software sales of the online service that we provide in connection with the sale we recognize the revenue from these games over the estimated online service period we also defer net revenue from sales of certain onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content for which we had an obligation to deliver incremental unspecified digital content in the future without an additional fee we recognize the revenue for these games on a straightline basis over the estimated period of game play 

we believe that excluding the impact of revenue deferral and the recognition of revenue deferral related to packaged goods games and digital content from our operating results is important to facilitate comparisons between periods in understanding our underlying sales performance for the period we use this nongaap measure internally to evaluate our operating performance when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods and when assessing the performance of our management team while we believe that this nongaap financial measure is useful in evaluating our business this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap in addition this nongaap financial measure may not be the same as nongaap measures presented by other companies

cost of goods sold for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 was as follows in millions 

 

 during fiscal year 2011 cost of goods sold decreased by 93 percent as a percentage of total net revenue as compared to fiscal year 2010 this decrease as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to 1 a 266 million decrease in the change in deferred net revenue related to certain onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content for fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 which positively impacted gross profit as a percent of total net revenue by 37 percentage points and 2 a greater percentage of net revenue from ea studio and digital products which have a higher margin than our copublishing and distribution products which positively impacted gross profit as a percentage of total revenue by approximately 33 percent

 our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2011 was a tax benefit of 11 percent our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2010 was a tax benefit of 41 percent in fiscal year 2011 the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 350 percent primarily due to us losses for which no benefit is recognized nonus losses with a reduced or zero tax benefit and nondeductible stockbased compensation expenses partially offset by tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of examination by taxing authorities in fiscal year 2010 the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 350 percent primarily due to us losses for which no benefit is recognized tax charges related to our integration of playfish nonus losses with a reduced or zero 

  

tax benefit and nondeductible stockbased compensation expenses partially offset by benefits related to the resolution of examinations by the taxing authorities and reductions in the valuation allowance of us deferred tax assets 

our effective income tax rates for fiscal year 2012 and future periods will depend on a variety of factors including changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance as well as changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions changes in our international structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix of income changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in our annual pretax income or loss we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our pretax consolidated income or loss as a result in absolute dollar terms our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pretax income or loss than at higher levels in addition at lower levels of pretax income or loss our effective tax rate will be more volatile 

certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law have not been considered as a source of future taxable income that is available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets 

the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 the “act” was signed into law on december 17 2010 the act contains a number of provisions including most notably a two year extension of the research tax credit the act will not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 due to the effect of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 

the worker homeownership and business assistance act of 2009 “the act” was signed into law on november 6 2009 the act provides that taxpayers may elect to increase the carry back period for tax losses incurred in a taxable year beginning or ending in either 2008 or 2009 during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2009 we elected to increase the carry back period for tax losses incurred in fiscal year 2009 this election resulted in a reduction in the valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets due to an increase in the sources of taxable income from the extended carry back period as a result we recorded a tax benefit of approximately 28 million in the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2009 for the reduction in the valuation allowance 

we historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly no us taxes have been provided thereon we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 changes in cash flow 

operating activities during fiscal year 2011 we generated 320 million of cash from operating activities as compared to generating 152 million in fiscal year 2010 the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to 1 a greater percentage of net revenue from ea studio and digital products which have higher margins than our copublishing and distribution products 2 the timing of payments related to our inventory purchases 3 our cost reduction initiatives including decreases in external development and contracted services and 4 lower marketing and advertising spend as a result of a decrease in the number of titles released as compared to the prior year 

investing activities cash used in investing activities decreased 557 million during the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 primarily due to 1 a 267 million decrease in cash used for acquisitions primarily from playfish during the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 2 a 246 million decrease in capital expenditures of which 233 million was used to purchase our redwood shores headquarters facilities during the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 3 121 million in proceeds received from the sale of our ubisoft investment 4 100 million in acquisitionrelated restricted cash for contingent consideration in connection with our acquisition of playfish in fiscal year 2010 and 5 a 97 million decrease in purchases of shortterm investments these decreases were partially offset by 268 million of lower proceeds received from maturities and sales of shortterm investments 

financing activities cash provided by financing activities decreased 76 million during the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 primarily due to 58 million net of commissions cash paid for the repurchase and retirement of our common stock 

shortterm investments and marketable equity securities 

due to our mix of fixed and variable rate securities our shortterm investment portfolio is susceptible to changes in shortterm interest rates as of march 31 2011 the gross unrealized gains and losses on our shortterm investments were immaterial and each were less than 1 percent of the total in shortterm investments from time to time we may liquidate some or all of our shortterm investments to fund operational needs or other activities such as capital expenditures business combinations or stock repurchase programs depending on which shortterm investments we liquidate to fund these activities we could recognize a portion or all of the gross unrealized gains or losses 

  

the fair value of our marketable equity securities decreased to 161 million as of march 31 2011 from 291 million as of march 31 2010 this decrease was primarily due to a 194 million decrease resulting from a decrease in the unrealized gains and the sale of a certain investment during the period this decrease was partially offset by a 73 million increase in the fair value of our investments in neowiz 

restricted cash and contingent consideration 

in connection with our acquisitions of playfish and chillingo we may be required to pay an additional 110 million of cash consideration of which 100 million was deposited into an escrow account as this deposit is restricted in nature it is excluded from cash and cash equivalents this cash consideration is based upon the achievement of certain performance milestones through march 31 2014 through fiscal year 2011 no distributions were made from the restricted cash amount as of march 31 2011 we have accrued 51 million of contingent consideration on our consolidated balance sheet 

fiscal 2011 restructuring 

in connection with our fiscal 2011 restructuring plan we expect to incur cash expenditures through june 2016 of approximately 1 42 million in fiscal year 2012 2 15 million in both fiscal years 2013 and 2014 3 11 million in fiscal year 2015 and 4 40 million thereafter the actual cash expenditures are variable as they will be dependent upon the actual revenue we generate from certain games 

financial condition 

we believe that cash cash equivalents shortterm investments marketable equity securities cash generated from operations and available financing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next 12 months including working capital requirements capital expenditures and potentially future acquisitions stock repurchases or strategic investments we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position facilitate expansion repurchase our stock pursue strategic acquisitions and investments andor to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise there can be no assurance however that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms if at all or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 

as of march 31 2011 approximately 793 million of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and 69 million of our marketable equity securities were domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions while we have no plans to repatriate these funds to the united states in the short term if we choose to do so we would be required to accrue and pay additional taxes on any portion of the repatriation where no united states income tax had been previously provided 

during fiscal year 2011 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 600 million of our common stock over the next 18 months the timing and actual amount of the stock repurchases will depend on several factors including price capital availability regulatory requirements alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions we are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares under the program and the repurchase program may be modified suspended or discontinued at any time 

we have a “shelf” registration statement on form s3 on file with the sec this shelf registration statement which includes a base prospectus allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus we would use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes including for working capital financing capital expenditures research and development marketing and distribution efforts and if opportunities arise for acquisitions or strategic alliances pending such uses we may invest the net proceeds in interestbearing securities in addition we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time 

our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those related to customer demand and acceptance of our products our ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due successfully achieving our product release schedules and attaining our forecasted 

  

   

sales objectives the impact of acquisitions and other strategic transactions in which we may engage the impact of competition economic conditions in the united states and abroad the seasonal and cyclical nature of our business and operating results risks of product returns and the other risks described in the “risk factors” section included in part i item 1a of this report 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

development celebrity league and content licenses payments and commitments 

the products we produce in our studios are designed and created by our employee designers artists software programmers and by nonemployee software developers “independent artists” or “thirdparty developers” we typically advance development funds to the independent artists and thirdparty developers during development of our games usually in installment payments made upon the completion of specified development milestones contractually these payments are generally considered advances against subsequent royalties on the sales of the products these terms are set forth in written agreements entered into with the independent artists and thirdparty developers 

in addition we have certain celebrity league and content license contracts that contain minimum guarantee payments and marketing commitments that may not be dependent on any deliverables celebrities and organizations with whom we have contracts include fifa fifpro foundation fapl football association premier league limited and dfl deutsche fußball liga gmbh german soccer league professional soccer national basketball association professional basketball pga tour and tiger woods professional golf national hockey league and nhl players’ association professional hockey warner bros harry potter national football league properties players inc and red bear inc professional football collegiate licensing company collegiate football espn content in ea sports games hasbro inc most of hasbro’s toy and game intellectual properties lucasarts and lucas licensing star wars the old republic and the estate of robert ludlum robert ludlum novels and films these developer and content license commitments represent the sum of 1 the cash payments due under nonroyaltybearing licenses and services agreements and 2 the minimum guaranteed payments and advances against royalties due under royaltybearing licenses and services agreements the majority of which are conditional upon performance by the counterparty these minimum guarantee payments and any related marketing commitments are included in the table below 

the following table summarizes our unrecognized minimum contractual obligations as of march 31 2011 and the effect we expect them to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions 

 

  

   

the amounts represented in the table above reflect our unrecognized minimum cash obligations for the respective fiscal years but do not necessarily represent the periods in which they will be recognized and expensed in our consolidated financial statements in addition the amounts in the table above are presented based on the dates the amounts are contractually due however certain payment obligations may be accelerated depending on the performance of our operating results 

in addition to what is included in the table above as of march 31 2011 we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling 238 million of which approximately 37 million is offset by prior cash deposits to tax authorities for issues pending resolution for the remaining liability we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 

offbalance sheet commitments 

lease commitments 

as of march 31 2011 we leased certain of our current facilities furniture and equipment under noncancelable operating lease agreements we were required to pay property taxes insurance and normal maintenance costs for certain of these facilities and any increases over the base year of these expenses on the remainder of our facilities 

director indemnity agreements 

we entered into indemnification agreements with each of the members of our board of directors at the time they joined the board to indemnify them to the extent permitted by law against any and all liabilities costs expenses amounts paid in settlement and damages incurred by the directors as a result of any lawsuit or any judicial administrative or investigative proceeding in which the directors are sued or charged as a result of their service as members of our board of directors 

inflation 

we believe the impact of inflation on our results of operations has not been significant in any of the past three fiscal years

cash flow hedging activities  from time to time we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreigncurrencydenominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing foreign currency option contracts that generally have maturities of 15 months or less these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges the derivative assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity the gross amount of the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is subsequently reclassified into net revenue or research and development expenses as appropriate in the period when the forecasted transaction is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations in the event that the gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are deemed to be ineffective the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value if any is reclassified to interest and other income net in our consolidated statements of operations in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur or it becomes remote that they will occur within the defined hedge period the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income net in our consolidated statements of operations during the reporting periods all forecasted transactions occurred and therefore there were no such gains or losses reclassified into interest and other income net our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements in net revenue and research and development expenses as of march 31 2011 we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately 40 million in foreign currency and to sell approximately 10 million of foreign currency all of the foreign currency option contracts outstanding as of march 31 2011 will mature in the next 12 months as of march 31 2010 we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately 18 million in foreign currency and to sell approximately 30 million of foreign currencies as of march 31 2011 and 2010 the fair value of these outstanding foreign currency option contracts was immaterial and are included in other current assets 

balance sheet hedging activities  we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily intercompany receivables and payables the foreign currency forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three months or less and are transacted near monthend our foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as other current assets or accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in interest and other income net in our consolidated statements of operations the gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities which are also reported in interest and other income net in our consolidated statements of operations in certain cases the amount of such gains and losses will significantly differ from the amount of gains and losses recognized on the underlying foreigncurrencydenominated monetary asset or liability in which case our results will be impacted as of march 31 2011 we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell approximately 187 million in foreign currencies of this amount 140 million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in 

  

exchange for us dollars 31 million to purchase foreign currency in exchange for us dollars and 16 million to sell foreign currency in exchange for british pounds sterling as of march 31 2010 we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell approximately 431 million in foreign currencies of this amount 293 million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars 127 million to purchase foreign currency in exchange for us dollars and 11 million to sell foreign currency in exchange for british pounds sterling the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was immaterial as of march 31 2011 and 2010 

we believe the counterparties to these foreign currency forward and option contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material the disruption in the global financial markets has impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of the disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations as of march 31 2011 a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value of the premiums on our foreign currency option contracts used in cash flow hedging of less than 1 million in each scenario as of march 31 2011 a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would have resulted in potential losses on our foreign currency forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of 17 million and 26 million respectively this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar however all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and actual results may differ materially 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities however because shortterm investments mature relatively quickly and are required to be reinvested at the thencurrent market rates interest income on a portfolio consisting of shortterm investments is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term investments additionally the contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to call prepay or otherwise settle the investments at prices less than the stated par value our investments are held for purposes other than trading also we do not use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio 

as of march 31 2011 and 2010 our shortterm investments were classified as availableforsale securities and consequently were recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in stockholders’ equity our portfolio of shortterm investments consisted of the following investment categories summarized by fair value as of march 31 2011 and 2010 in millions 

 

 notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations at any time a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio the following table presents the hypothetical changes in the fair value in our shortterm investment portfolio as of march 31 2011 arising from 

  

   

potential changes in interest rates the modeling technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps 

 

 the following table presents the hypothetical changes in the fair value in our shortterm investment portfolio as of march 31 2010 arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 

 

 market price risk 

the fair value of our marketable equity securities in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility and foreign currency risk for investments denominated in foreign currencies as of march 31 2011 and 2010 our marketable equity securities were classified as availableforsale securities and consequently were recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in stockholders’ equity the fair value of our marketable equity securities as of march 31 2011 and 2010 was 161 million and 291 million respectively 

our marketable equity securities have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by volatility in the public stock markets at any time a sharp change in market prices in our investments in marketable equity securities could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investments the following table presents hypothetical changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities as of march 31 2011 arising from changes in market prices of plus or minus 25 percent 50 percent and 75 percent 

 

 the following table presents hypothetical changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities as of march 31 2010 arising from changes in market prices of plus or minus 25 percent 50 percent and 75 percent

 item 1 business tableend we develop market publish and distribute video game software and content that can be played by consumers on a variety of platforms including 

 

  

  

  

 our ability to publish games across multiple platforms has been and will continue to be a cornerstone of our product strategy historically there have been multiple video game consoles and handheld game players available to consumers and there has been vigorous competition among these platforms for consumer acceptance in fiscal year 2010 the platforms for which we produced the most software products were 

 

 our products for videogame consoles pcs and handhelds are delivered on physical media disks and cartridges that are sold at retailers we call these “packaged goods” products we also deliver game content and services online directly to consumers for the platforms listed above some online delivered content and services are addons or are related to our packaged goods products  eg  addon content or matchmaking services while 

  

  

other games content and services that we offer such as games for mobile devices and internetonly games are available only through online delivery we believe that online delivery of game content and services will become an increasingly important part of our business over time 

our games span a diverse range of categories including actionadventure casual sports family fantasy racing music massivelymultiplayer online roleplaying simulation and strategy we have created licensed and acquired a strong portfolio of intellectual property which we market and sell to a variety of consumers our portfolio of whollyowned properties includes established brands such as need for speed™ the sims™ spore™ dead space™  mass effect™ and battlefield™  and newly launched properties in fiscal year 2010 such as ea sports active ™  dragon age ™  origins and dante’s inferno ™ our portfolio of games based on licensed intellectual property includes sportsbased titles such as madden nfl football fifa soccer and tiger woods pga tour ®  and titles based on popular brands such as harry potter™ and hasbro through our ea partners business we also codevelop copublish andor distribute video games that are developed and published by other companies including the mtv gamesharmonix series rock band™ and the crytek series crysis ®  

another cornerstone of our strategy is to publish products that can be iterated or sequeled for example a new edition for most of our sports products such as madden nfl football is released each year other products such as the sims and battlefield are sequeled on a lessfrequent basis we refer to these successful iterated product families as “franchises” we also make addon content available for purchase online or through expansion packs sold at retail for many of our products 

we develop our games using both internal and external resources for the fiscal years ended march 31 2010 2009 and 2008 research and development expenses were 1229 million 1359 million and 1145 million respectively we operate development studios which develop products and perform other related functions worldwide bioware canada and united states bright light united kingdom criterion united kingdom dice sweden ea canada ea los angeles united states ea montreal canada ea romania maxis united states playfish united states united kingdom china and norway ea salt lake city united states ea seoul studio korea ea singapore ea mythic united states pogo united states and china the sims studio united states ea tiburon united states and visceral united states  we have quality assurance functions located in the united states canada the united kingdom sweden germany romania china india korea and singapore and localization functions located in germany spain and japan we also engage third parties to assist with the development of our games at their own development and production studios 

our global sales network allows us to market publish and distribute games in over 35 countries throughout the world we generate a significant portion of our net revenue from direct sales of packaged goods products to retailers and in some of our smaller international territories we work with third parties to distribute our packaged goods products many of our games and other online content are also available to consumers via proprietary networks such as the xbox live ® marketplace on the xbox 360 console and the playstation network on the playstation 3 and psp consoles or via the internet including our own online stores we also market and distribute games and other content for mobile devices through mobile carriers and proprietary online stores that provide applications for specific devices  ie  mobile application storefronts such as the apple app store which provides applications for the apple iphone and ipod touch or google’s android market for android compatible phones 

our north america net revenue which was primarily generated in the united states decreased by 16 percent to 2025 million or 55 percent of total net revenue in fiscal year 2010 as compared to 2412 million or 57 percent of total net revenue in fiscal year 2009 and as compared to 1942 million or 53 percent of total net revenue in fiscal year 2008 internationally we conduct business through our international headquarters in switzerland and have whollyowned subsidiaries throughout the world including offices in europe australia asia and latin america international net revenue  ie  net revenue derived from countries other than canada and the united states decreased by 10 percent to 1629 million or 45 percent of total net revenue in fiscal year 2010 as compared to 1800 million or 43 percent of total net revenue in fiscal year 2009 and as compared to 1723 million or 47 percent of total net revenue in fiscal year 2008

competition 

we compete with other video game companies for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers as well as with other providers of different forms of entertainment such as motion pictures television social networking online casual entertainment and music our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large diversified corporations with global operations and greater financial resources than ours 

we also face competition from other video game companies and large media companies to obtain license agreements for the right to use some of the intellectual property included in our products some of these content licenses are controlled by the diversified media companies which in some cases have decided to publish their own games based on popular entertainment properties that they control rather than licensing the content to a video game company such as us 

competition in sales of packaged goods 

the packaged goods video game business is characterized by the frequent launch of new games which may be sequels of popular game franchises or newly introduced game concepts there is also rapid technological innovation in the packaged goods game business as competing companies continually improve their use of the powerful platforms on which games are designed to run and extend the game experience through additional content and online services such as matchmaking and multiplayer functionality competition is also based on product quality and features timing of product releases brandname recognition availability and quality of ingame content access to distribution channels effectiveness of marketing and price 

for sales of packaged goods we compete directly with sony microsoft and nintendo each of which develop and publish software for their respective console platforms we also compete with numerous companies which like us develop and publish video games that operate on these consoles and on pcs and handheld game players these competitors include activision blizzard atari capcom koei konami lucasarts namco sega taketwo interactive thq and ubisoft diversified media companies such as fox disney time warner and viacom are also expanding their software game publishing efforts 

we also see a change in retail sales patterns which decreases our ability to derive revenue from “catalog sales” sales of games in the periods following the launch quarter currently many console games experience sales cycles that are shorter than in the past to mitigate this trend we offer our consumers new directtoconsumer services such as additional content to further enhance the gaming experience and extend the time that consumers play our games after their initial purchase 

competition in games for mobile devices 

the mobile entertainment applications market segment for which we develop and publish games for mobile devices is characterized by frequent product introductions rapidly emerging new mobile platforms new technologies and new mobile application storefronts as the penetration of mobile devices that feature fullyfunctional browsers and additional gaming capabilities continues to deepen the demand for applications continues to increase and as there are more mobile application storefronts through which developers can offer products we expect new competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources to develop and market competing applications as a result we expect competition in the mobile entertainment market to intensify 

current and potential competitors in the mobile entertainment applications market include major media companies traditional video game publishing companies mobile carriers mobile software providers and other companies that specialize in mobile entertainment applications we also compete with mobile content aggregators who pool applications from multiple developers and sometimes publishers and offer them to carriers or through other sales channels in addition new and existing competitors are offering mobile entertainment applications on a free download adsupported basis currently we consider our primary competitors in the mobile entertainment applications market to be capcom mobile gameloft glu mobile namco and popcap 

  

   

competition in online gaming services 

the online  ie  internetbased games market is characterized by frequent product introductions new and evolving business models and new platforms as the proportion of households with a broadband connection continues to grow we expect new competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources toward developing online games services as a result we expect competition in the online game services market to intensify 

our current and potential competitors in the online games market include major media companies traditional video game publishing companies and companies that specialize in online games including social networking game companies in the massively multiplayer online game business our competitors include activision blizzard atari nc soft and sony competing providers of other kinds of online games include aol big fish msn nexon popcap real yahoo and zynga and other providers of games on social networking platforms such as facebook 

intellectual property 

like other entertainment companies our business is significantly based on the creation acquisition exploitation and protection of intellectual property some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code patented technology and other technology and trade secrets that we use to develop our games and to make them run properly other intellectual property is in the form of audiovisual elements that consumers can see hear and interact with when they are playing our games — we call this form of intellectual property “content” 

we develop products from whollyowned intellectual properties we create within our own studios we also acquire the rights to include proprietary intellectual property in our products through acquisitions in addition we obtain content and intellectual property through licenses and service agreements such as those with sports leagues and players’ associations movie studios and performing talent authors and literary publishers music labels music publishers and musicians these agreements typically limit our use of the licensed rights in products for specific time periods in addition our products that play on game consoles handhelds and mobile devices include technology that is owned by the console or mobile device manufacturer and licensed nonexclusively to us for use we also license technology from providers other than console and mobile device manufacturers while we may have renewal rights for some licenses our business and the justification for the development of many of our products is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain the intellectual property rights from the owners of these rights on reasonable terms and at reasonable rates 

we actively engage in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property we typically own the copyright to the software code as well as the brand or title name trademark under which our products are marketed we register copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries as appropriate 

as with other forms of entertainment our products are susceptible to unauthorized copying and piracy we typically distribute our pc products using copy protection technology digital rights management technology or other technological protection measures to prevent piracy and the use of unauthorized copies of our products in addition console manufacturers typically incorporate technological protections and other security measures in their consoles in an effort to prevent the use of unlicensed product we are actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect against unauthorized copying and piracy including monitoring online channels for distribution of pirated copies and participating in various industrywide enforcement initiatives education programs and legislative activity around the world

the console handheld and pc games that we publish are made available to consumers as packaged goods usually in bluray disc cd dvd cartridge or universal media disc format that are typically sold at retailers including online retailers such as amazon in north america and europe our largest markets we sell these packaged goods products primarily to retailers including mass market retailers such as walmart electronics specialty stores such as best buy or game software specialty stores such as gamestop many of our products and related content such as booster packs expansion packs and smaller pieces of game content can also be purchased over the internet through digital download or through mobile application storefronts accessed directly from videogame consoles or mobile devices 

we generated approximately 75 percent of our north america net revenue from direct sales to retailers in fiscal year 2010 with the remaining net revenue being generated through a limited number of specialized and regional distributors in markets where we believe direct sales would not be economical we had direct sales to gamestop corp which represented approximately 16 percent 14 percent and 13 percent of total net revenue in fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively we also had direct sales to walmart stores inc which represented approximately 12 percent 14 percent and 12 percent of total net revenue in fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively we sell our products to gamestop and walmart pursuant to numerous and frequent individual purchase orders which contain delivery and pricing terms there is no commitment by either gamestop or walmart to purchase or for us to sell to either gamestop or walmart any minimum level of product 

mobile carriers 

we have agreements to distribute our mobile applications through more than 320 carriers in over 55 countries our customers download our applications to their mobile devices and their mobile carrier invoices them either a onetime or monthly subscription fee our carrier distribution agreements establish the fees to be retained by the 

  

   

carrier for distributing our applications these arrangements are typically terminable on short notice the agreements generally do not obligate the carriers to market or distribute any of our applications 

content licensors 

many of our products are based on or incorporate content and trademarks owned by others for example our products include rights licensed from third parties including major movie studios publishers artists authors celebrities traditional game and toy companies athletes and the major sports leagues and players’ associations 

ea partners 

through our ea partners group we team with external game developers and third party companies to provide these partners with a variety of services including development assistance publishing and distribution for example through agreements with crytek and harmonix a subsidiary of viacom we plan to release crysis 2 and have released the beatles rock band respectively additionally we have a development agreement with epic games for our upcoming release of bulletstorm  

inventory working capital backlog manufacturing and suppliers 

we manage inventory by communicating with our customers prior to the release of our products and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct and territorybyterritory basis historically we have experienced high turnover of our products and the lead times on reorders of our products are generally two to three weeks further as discussed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we have practices in place with our customers such as stock balancing and price protection that reduce product returns 

we typically ship orders immediately upon receipt to the extent that any backlog may or may not exist at the end of a reporting period it would be an unreliable indicator of future results of any period 

in many instances we are able to acquire materials on a volumediscount basis we have multiple potential sources of supply for most materials except for the disk or cartridge component of our playstation 3 playstation 2 psp wii and nintendo ds products 

seasonality 

our business is highly seasonal we have historically experienced our highest sales volume in the holiday season quarter ending in december and a seasonal low in sales volume in the quarter ending in june while our sales generally follow this seasonal trend there can be no assurance that this trend will continue in addition we defer the recognition of a significant amount of net revenue related to our onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content over an extended period of time generally six months as a result the quarter in which we generate the highest sales volume may be different than the quarter in which we recognize the highest amount of net revenue our results can also vary based on a number of factors including title release dates consumer demand for our products shipment schedules and our revenue recognition policies 

employees 

as of march 31 2010 we had approximately 7800 regular fulltime employees over 4600 of whom were outside the united states we believe that our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is a critical factor in the successful development of our products and that our future success will depend in large measure on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees approximately 3 percent of our employees all of whom work for dice our swedish development studio are represented by a union

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs our business and financial performance could be harmed our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may harm our business and financial performance 

our business is highly dependent on the success and availability of video game hardware systems manufactured by third parties as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products for these systems 

we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play on video game hardware systems which we also refer to as “platforms” manufactured by third parties such as sony’s playstation 3 microsoft’s xbox 360 and nintendo’s wii the success of our business is driven in large part by the commercial success and adequate supply of these video game hardware systems our ability to accurately predict which systems will be successful in the marketplace and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these systems we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of anticipated product ship dates a platform for which we are developing products may not succeed or may have a shorter life cycle than anticipated if consumer demand for the systems for which we are developing products is lower than our expectations our revenue will suffer we may be unable to fully recover the investments we have made in developing our products and our financial performance will be harmed alternatively a system for which we have not devoted significant resources could be more successful than we had initially anticipated causing us to miss out on meaningful revenue opportunities 

if we do not consistently meet our product development schedules our operating results will be adversely affected 

our business is highly seasonal with the highest levels of consumer demand and a significant percentage of our sales occurring in the december quarter in addition we seek to release many of our products in conjunction with specific events such as the release of a related movie or the beginning of a sports season or major sporting event if we miss these key selling periods for any reason including product delays or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have developed products our sales will suffer disproportionately likewise if a key event to which our product release schedule is tied were to be delayed or cancelled our sales would also suffer disproportionately our ability to meet product development schedules is affected by a number of factors including the creative processes involved the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams required by the increasing complexity of our products and the platforms for which they are developed and the need to finetune our products prior to their release we have experienced development delays for our products in the past which caused us to push back release dates in the future any failure to meet anticipated production or release schedules would likely result in a delay of revenue andor possibly a significant shortfall in our revenue increase our development expense harm our profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different than anticipated 

our business is intensely competitive and “hit” driven if we do not deliver “hit” products and services or if consumers prefer our competitors’ products or services over our own our operating results could suffer 

competition in our industry is intense and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge in the united states and abroad while many new products and services are regularly introduced only a relatively small number of “hit” titles accounts for a significant portion of total revenue in our industry we find that driving “hit” titles often requires large marketing budgets and media spend we may not recover the investments that we make in marketing and advertising on certain products and that could harm our profitability hit products or services offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause revenue generated from our products and services to fall below expectations if our competitors develop and market more successful products or services offer competitive products or services at lower price points or based 

  

  

on payment models perceived as offering a better value proposition such as payforplay or subscriptionbased models or if we do not continue to develop consistently highquality and wellreceived products and services our revenue margins and profitability will decline 

our adoption of new business models could fail to produce our desired financial returns 

we are actively seeking to monetize the game properties that we publish through a variety of new platforms and business models including online distribution microtransactions and subscription services forecasting our revenues and profitability for these new business models is inherently uncertain and volatile our actual revenues and profits for these businesses may be significantly greater or less than our forecasts additionally these new business models could fail for one or more of our titles resulting in the loss of our investment in the development and infrastructure needed to support these new business models and the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from more successful businesses 

if our marketing and advertising efforts fail to resonate with our customers our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs such as television and online advertising print advertising retail merchandising website development and event sponsorship our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part upon the success of these programs if the marketing for our products and services fail to resonate with our customers particularly during the critical holiday season or during other key selling periods or if advertising rates or other media placement costs increase these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

as a result of the national and global economic downturn overall consumer spending has declined and retailers globally have taken a more conservative stance in ordering game inventory the decrease in discretionary consumer spending contributed to the decline in the demand for our products during the 2009 holiday selling season continued economic distress which may result in a further decrease in demand for our products particularly during key product launch windows could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could also increase the risk of material losses on our investments increase costs associated with developing and publishing our products increase the cost and decrease the availability of sources of financing and increase our exposure to material losses from bad debts any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results if we experience further deterioration in our market capitalization or our financial performance we could be required to recognize significant impairment charges in future periods 

our business is subject to currency fluctuations 

international sales are a fundamental part of our business for the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 international net revenue comprised 45 percent of our total net revenue we expect international sales to continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue such sales may be subject to unexpected regulatory requirements tariffs and other barriers additionally foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies which may fluctuate against the us dollar in addition our foreign investments and our cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies are subject to currency fluctuations we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate some foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily certain intercompany receivables and payables to a limited extent and foreign currency option contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions primarily related to a portion of the revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currency generated by our operational subsidiaries however these activities are limited in the protection they provide us from foreign currency fluctuations and can themselves result in losses the disruption in the global financial markets has also impacted many of the financial institutions with which we do business a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of the disruption in the financial markets could negatively impact our treasury operations including our ability to 

  

   

secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs accordingly our results of operations including our reported net revenue operating expenses and net income and financial condition can be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations especially the euro british pound sterling and canadian dollar 

volatility in the capital markets may adversely impact the value of our investments and could cause us to recognize significant impairment charges in our operating results 

our portfolio of shortterm investments and marketable equity securities is subject to volatility in the capital markets and to national and international economic conditions in particular our international investments can be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency and our shortterm investments are susceptible to changes in shortterm interest rates these investments are also impacted by declines in value attributable to the creditworthiness of the issuer from time to time we may liquidate some or all of our shortterm investments or marketable equity securities to fund operational needs or other activities such as capital expenditures strategic investments or business acquisitions or for other purposes if we were to liquidate these shortterm investments at a time when they were worth less than what we had originally purchased them for or if the obligor were unable to pay the full amount at maturity we could incur a significant loss similarly we hold marketable equity securities which have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by price and trading volume volatility in the public stock markets we could be required to recognize impairment charges on the securities held by us andor we may realize losses on the sale of these securities all of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 we recognized impairment charges of 26 million on our investment in the9 

the majority of our sales are made to a relatively small number of key customers if these customers reduce their purchases of our products or become unable to pay for them our business could be harmed 

during the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 approximately 75 percent of our north american sales were made to our top ten customers in europe our top ten customers accounted for approximately 48 percent of our sales in that territory during the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 worldwide we had direct sales to two customers gamestop corp and walmart stores inc which represented approximately 16 percent and 12 percent respectively of total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 as a result of the economic downturn retailers globally continue to take a more conservative stance in ordering game inventory though our products are available to consumers through a variety of retailers the concentration of our sales in one or a few large customers could lead to a shortterm disruption in our sales if one or more of these customers significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to carry our products and could make us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers became unable to pay for our products or declared bankruptcy additionally our receivables from these large customers increase significantly in the december quarter as they make purchases in anticipation of the holiday selling season also having such a large portion of our total net revenue concentrated in a few customers could reduce our negotiating leverage with these customers if one or more of our key customers experience deterioration in their business or become unable to obtain sufficient financing to maintain their operations our business could be harmed 

sales of used video game products could lower our sales of new video games 

certain of our retail customers sell used video games used video game sales have been growing in north america and are emerging in europe used video games are generally priced lower than new video games and the margins on used games sales are generally greater for retailers than the margins on new game sales we do not receive revenue from used video game sales sales of used video games may negatively impact our sales and profitability and may continue to do so to a greater or lesser extent in the future 

our industry is cyclical driven by the periodic introduction of new video game hardware systems as we continue to move through the current cycle our industry growth may slow down and as a result our operating results may be difficult to predict 

video game hardware systems have historically had a life cycle of four to six years which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well the current cycle began with microsoft’s launch of the xbox 360 in 2005 

  

  

and continued in 2006 when sony and nintendo launched their nextgeneration systems the playstation 3 and the wii respectively sales of software designed for these hardware systems represent the majority of our revenue so our growth and success is highly correlated to sales of video game hardware systems while there are indications that this current cycle may be extended longer than prior cycles — in part due to the growth of online services and content the greater graphic and processing power of the current generation hardware and the introduction of new peripherals — growth in the installed base of the current generation of video game systems is likely to slow down in the coming years this slowdown in sales of video game players may cause a corresponding slowdown in the growth of sales of video game software which could significantly affect our operating results 

technology changes rapidly in our business and if we fail to anticipate or successfully implement new technologies in our games the quality timeliness and competitiveness of our products and services will suffer 

rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate sometimes years in advance which technologies we must implement and take advantage of in order to make our products and services competitive in the market therefore we usually start our product development with a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve we may not be able to achieve these goals or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly and effectively than we can in either case our products and services may be technologically inferior to our competitors’ less appealing to consumers or both if we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule of our products and services then we may delay their release until these technology goals can be achieved which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses alternatively we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies either to preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up with our competition which would increase our development expenses 

the video game hardware manufacturers are among our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of andor access to our video game products if they do not approve our products we will be unable to ship to our customers 

our agreements with hardware licensors such as sony for the playstation 3 microsoft for the xbox 360 and nintendo for the wii typically give significant control to the licensor over the approval and manufacturing of our products which could in certain circumstances leave us unable to get our products approved manufactured and shipped to customers these hardware licensors are also among our chief competitors generally control of the approval and manufacturing process by the hardware licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently while we believe that our relationships with our hardware licensors are currently good the potential for these licensors to delay or refuse to approve or manufacture our products exists such occurrences would harm our business and our financial performance 

we also require compatibility code and the consent of sony microsoft and nintendo in order to include online capabilities in our products for their respective platforms and to digitally distribute our products through their proprietary networks as online capabilities for video game systems become more significant sony microsoft and nintendo could restrict the manner in which we provide online capabilities for our products they may also restrict the number of products that we may distribute digitally on their networks if sony microsoft or nintendo refuse to approve our products with online capabilities restrict our digital download offerings on their proprietary networks or significantly impact the financial terms on which these services are offered to our customers our business could be harmed 

the video game hardware manufacturers set the royalty rates and other fees that we must pay to publish games for their platforms and therefore have significant influence on our costs if one or more of these manufacturers change their fee structure our profitability will be materially impacted 

in order to publish products for a video game system such as the xbox 360 playstation 3 or wii we must take a license from microsoft sony and nintendo respectively which gives these companies the opportunity to 

  

   

set the fee structure that we must pay in order to publish games for that platform similarly these companies have retained the flexibility to change their fee structures or adopt different fee structures for online purchases of games online gameplay and other new features for their consoles the control that hardware manufacturers have over the fee structures for their platforms and online access could adversely impact our costs profitability and margins because publishing products for video game systems is the largest portion of our business any increase in fee structures would significantly harm our ability to generate profits 

if we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to include intellectual property owned by others in our games or to maintain or acquire the rights to publish or distribute games developed by others we will sell fewer hit titles and our revenue profitability and cash flows will decline competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and reduce our profitability 

many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our ea sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players’ associations similarly many of our other hit franchises such as harry potter are based on key film and literary licenses and our hasbro products are based on a license for these key toy and game properties in addition some of our most successful products in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 the rock band and left 4 dead series were products for which we have distribution rights competition for these licenses and rights is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses and rights or obtain additional licenses or rights with significant commercial value our revenues profitability and cash flows will decline significantly competition for these licenses may also drive up the advances guarantees and royalties that we must pay to licensors and developers which could significantly increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

our business is subject to risks generally associated with the entertainment industry any of which could significantly harm our operating results 

our business is subject to risks that are generally associated with the entertainment industry many of which are beyond our control these risks could negatively impact our operating results and include the popularity price and timing of our games and the platforms on which they are played economic conditions that adversely affect discretionary consumer spending changes in consumer demographics the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted 

if we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel we will be unable to effectively conduct our business 

the market for technical creative marketing and other personnel essential to the development and marketing of our products and management of our businesses is extremely competitive our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of executives and key creative talent if we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need or replace key employees following their departure our ability to develop and manage our business will be impaired 

acquisitions investments and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties dilution to our investors and other negative consequences 

we have engaged in evaluated and expect to continue to engage in and evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions including 1 acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets 2 minority investments in strategic partners and 3 investments in new interactive entertainment businesses for example online and mobile games any of these strategic transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations although we regularly search for opportunities to engage in strategic transactions we may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities we may not be able to consummate potential acquisitions or investments or an acquisition or investment we do consummate may not enhance our business or may decrease rather than increase our earnings the process of acquiring and integrating a company or business or successfully exploiting acquired intellectual property or other assets could divert a 

  

  

significant amount of resources as well as our management’s time and focus and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures particularly for a large acquisition additional risks and variations of the foregoing risks we face include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 future acquisitions and investments could also involve the issuance of our equity and equitylinked securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses such as stockbased compensation any of the foregoing factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating performance that could have otherwise been achieved by us on a standalone basis our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights which could harm our business 

from time to time third parties may assert claims against us relating to patents copyrights trademarks personal publicity rights or other intellectual property rights to technologies products or deliverypayment methods that are important to our business although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others it is possible that third parties still may claim 

  

   

infringement for example we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from certain individuals and companies who have acquired patent portfolios for the sole purpose of asserting such claims against other companies in addition many of our products are highly realistic and feature materials that are based on real world examples which may be the subject of intellectual property infringement claims of others from time to time we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims existing or future infringement claims against us whether valid or not may be time consuming and expensive to defend such claims or litigations could require us to pay damages and other costs stop selling the affected products redesign those products to avoid infringement or obtain a license all of which could be costly and harm our business in addition many patents have been issued that may apply to potential new modes of delivering playing or monetizing game software products and services such as those that we produce or would like to offer in the future we may discover that future opportunities to provide new and innovative modes of game play and game delivery to consumers may be precluded by existing patents that we are unable to license on reasonable terms 

from time to time we may become involved in other legal proceedings which could adversely affect us 

we are currently and from time to time in the future may become subject to legal proceedings claims litigation and government investigations or inquiries which could be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations in addition the outcome of any legal proceedings claims litigation investigations or inquiries may be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

our business is subject to increasing regulation and the adoption of proposed legislation we oppose could negatively impact our business 

legislation is continually being introduced in the united states at the local state and federal levels for the establishment of government mandated rating requirements or restrictions on distribution of entertainment software based on content to date most courts that have ruled on such legislation have ruled in a manner favorable to the interactive entertainment industry other countries have adopted or are considering laws regulating or mandating ratings requirements on entertainment software content and certain foreign countries already allow government censorship of entertainment software products adoption of government ratings system or restrictions on distribution of entertainment software based on content could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers and compliance with new and possibly inconsistent regulations for different territories could be costly or delay the release of our products 

as we increase the online delivery of our products and services we are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet in addition laws and regulations relating to user privacy data collection and retention content advertising and information security have been adopted or are being considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation furthermore any failure on our part to comply with these laws or the application of these laws in an unanticipated manner may harm our business 

our products are subject to the threat of piracy and unauthorized copying 

entertainment software piracy is a persistent problem in our industry the growth in peertopeer networks and other channels to download pirated copies of our products the increasing availability of broadband access to the internet and the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures used with our products all have contributed to an expansion in piracy though we take technical steps to make the unauthorized copying of our products more difficult as do the manufacturers of consoles on which our games are played these efforts may not be successful in controlling the piracy of our products 

while legal protections exist to combat piracy preventing and curbing infringement through enforcement of our intellectual property rights may be difficult costly and time consuming particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights further the scope of the legal protection of copyright and 

  

  

prohibitions against the circumvention of technological protection measures to protect copyrighted works are often under scrutiny by courts and governing bodies the repeal or weakening of laws intended to combat piracy protect intellectual property and prohibit the circumvention of technological protection measures could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect against piracy these factors could have a negative effect on our growth and profitability in the future 

if one or more of our titles were found to contain hidden objectionable content our business could suffer 

throughout the history of our industry many video games have been designed to include certain hidden content and gameplay features that are accessible through the use of ingame cheat codes or other technological means that are intended to enhance the gameplay experience however in several cases hidden content or features have been found to be included in other publishers’ products by an employee who was not authorized to do so or by an outside developer without the knowledge of the publisher from time to time some hidden content and features have contained profanity graphic violence and sexually explicit or otherwise objectionable material in a few cases the entertainment software ratings board “esrb” has reacted to discoveries of hidden content and features by reviewing the rating that was originally assigned to the product requiring the publisher to change the game packaging andor fining the publisher retailers have on occasion reacted to the discovery of such hidden content by removing these games from their shelves refusing to sell them and demanding that their publishers accept them as product returns likewise consumers have reacted to the revelation of hidden content by refusing to purchase such games demanding refunds for games they have already purchased and refraining from buying other games published by the company whose game contained the objectionable material 

we have implemented preventative measures designed to reduce the possibility of hidden objectionable content from appearing in the video games we publish nonetheless these preventative measures are subject to human error circumvention overriding and reasonable resource constraints in addition to the extent we acquire a company without similar controls in place the possibility of hidden objectionable content appearing in video games developed by that company but for which we are ultimately responsible could increase if a video game we published were found to contain hidden objectionable content the esrb could demand that we recall a game and change its packaging to reflect a revised rating retailers could refuse to sell it and demand we accept the return of any unsold copies or returns from customers and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand that we refund their money this could have a material negative impact on our operating results and financial condition in addition our reputation could be harmed which could impact sales of other video games we sell if any of these consequences were to occur our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed 

if we ship defective products our operating results could suffer 

products such as ours are extremely complex software programs and are difficult to develop manufacture and distribute we have quality controls in place to detect defects in the software media and packaging of our products before they are released nonetheless these quality controls are subject to human error overriding and reasonable resource constraints therefore these quality controls and preventative measures may not be effective in detecting defects in our products before they have been reproduced and released into the marketplace in such an event we could be required to recall a product or we may find it necessary to voluntarily recall a product andor scrap defective inventory which could significantly harm our business and operating results 

breaches of our security measures and unintended disclosures of our intellectual property or our customer data could adversely affect our business 

we take measures to prevent our source code and other confidential information from unauthorized access a security breach that results in the disclosure of our source code other confidential assets or prerelease software could lead to piracy of our software or otherwise compromise our product plans when we conduct business online directly with consumers we may be the victim of fraudulent transactions including credit card fraud which presents a risk to our revenues and potentially disrupts service to our customers as we increase our online businesses we are also collecting and storing an increasing amount of customer data some of it personally identifiable information including credit card data it is possible that our security controls over customer data 

  

   

may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information a security breach that leads to disclosure of customer account information including personally identifiable information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue a resulting perception that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could result in a loss of current or potential customers for our online offerings that require the collection of customer data 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain adequate operational services and supporting infrastructure 

as we increase our online products and services we expect to continue to invest in technology services hardware and software including data centers network services storage and database technologies to support existing services and to introduce new products and services including websites ecommerce capabilities online game communities and online game play services creating the appropriate support for online business initiatives is expensive and complex and could result in inefficiencies or operational failures and increased vulnerability to cyber attacks which could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience such failures could result in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers which could harm our business 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 

we are also required to estimate what our tax obligations will be in the future although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the estimation process and applicable laws are inherently uncertain and our estimates are not binding on tax authorities the tax laws’ treatment of software and internetbased transactions is particularly uncertain and in some cases currently applicable tax laws are illsuited to address these kinds of transactions apart from an adverse resolution of these uncertainties our effective tax rate also could be adversely affected by our profit level by changes in our business or changes in our structure resulting from the reorganization of our business and operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the elections we make changes in applicable tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions or changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as well as other factors in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 we recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggest that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized further our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should our ultimate tax liability exceed our estimates our income tax provision and net income or loss could be materially affected 

we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our consolidated pretax income or loss as a result in absolute dollar terms our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pretax income or loss than at higher levels in addition at lower levels of pretax income or loss our effective tax rate will be more volatile 

we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under examination by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations changes in our business or changes in applicable tax rules will not have an adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition 

furthermore as we expand our international operations adopt new products and new distribution models implement changes to our operating structure or undertake intercompany transactions in light of changing tax 

  

  

laws expiring rulings acquisitions and our current and anticipated business and operational requirements our tax expense could increase 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves 

our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting policies promulgated by the securities and exchange commission “sec” and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies policies affecting software revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products and services we recognize all of the revenue from bundled sales  ie  packaged goods video games that include an online service component on a deferred basis over an estimated online service period which we generally estimate to be six months beginning in the month after shipment as we increase our downloadable content and add new features to our online service our estimate of the online service period may change and we could be required to recognize revenue over a longer period of time we expect that a significant portion of our games will be onlineenabled in the future and we could be required to recognize the related revenue over an extended period of time rather than at the time of sale in addition our adoption of financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” 805 business combinations  has had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for material acquisitions consummated after march 28 2009 as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue and taxes could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

we rely on business partners in many areas of our business and our business may be harmed if they are unable to honor their obligations to us 

we rely on various business partners including thirdparty service providers vendors licensing partners development partners and licensees among others in many areas of our business in many cases these third parties are given access to sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support to our teams these third parties may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it the failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies or the failure of the third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies could result in a disruption to our business operations further the disruption in the financial markets and the global economic downturn may adversely affect our business partners and they may not be able to continue honoring their obligations to us some of our business partners are highlyleveraged or small businesses that may be particularly vulnerable in the current economic environment alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner or vendor if we lose one or more significant business partners our business could be harmed 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors above as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts’ earnings estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts’ and investors’ expectations to factors affecting the entertainment computer software internet media or electronics industries to our ability to successfully integrate any acquisitions we may make or to national or international economic conditions in particular economic downturns may contribute to the public stock markets experiencing extreme price and trading volume volatility these broad market fluctuations have and could continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock

financial results 

total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 was 3654 million down 558 million as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2009 at march 31 2010 deferred net revenue associated with sales of onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content increased by 505 million as compared to march 31 2009 directly reducing the amount of reported net revenue during the year ended march 31 2010 at march 31 2009 deferred net revenue associated with sales of onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content decreased by 126 million as compared to march 31 2008 directly increasing the amount of reported net revenue during the year ended march 31 2009 without these changes in deferred net revenue reported net revenue increased by approximately 73 million during fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 net revenue for fiscal year 2010 was driven by fifa 10 madden nfl 10 and the sims 3  

net loss for the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 was 677 million as compared to a net loss of 1088 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2009 diluted loss per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 was 208 as compared to a diluted loss per share of 340 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2009 net loss decreased for fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 primarily as a result of 1 the recognition of 368 million of goodwill impairment during the fiscal year ended march 31 2009 2 a 262 million decrease in our income tax provision primarily due to the discrete tax charge to establish the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in 2009 3 a 261 million decrease in cost of goods sold and 4 a 130 million decrease in research and development costs these decreases were partially offset by 1 a decrease of 558 million in net revenue and 2 a 60 million increase in restructuring charges primarily from our fiscal 2010 restructuring 

during fiscal year 2010 we generated 152 million of cash from operating activities as compared to generating 12 million for fiscal year 2009 the increase in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to decreases in personnelrelated costs and external development and contracted services as part of our cost reduction initiatives as well as a reduction in incentivebased compensation payments 

  

   

trends in our business 

economic environment overall consumer spending has declined as a result of the national and global economic downturn retailers globally continue to take a conservative stance in ordering game inventory we believe that the continued decline in the packaged goods sector contributed to the lower than anticipated demand for our products during the 2009 holiday selling season we remain cautious about our future sales in light of the economic environment and the impact it has had on our business 

current generation game consoles video game hardware systems have historically had a life cycle of four to six years which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well the current cycle began with microsoft’s launch of the xbox 360 in 2005 and continued in 2006 when sony and nintendo launched their nextgeneration systems the playstation 3 and the wii respectively unlike past cycles we believe this current cycle may be extended partly due to the growth of online gaming services and content the greater graphic and processing power of the currentgeneration hardware and the introduction of new peripherals however growth in the installed base of users of the xbox 360 the playstation 3 and the wii may slow down in light of the economic environment consequently our industry may experience a decline 

wireless platforms  advances in wireless technology have resulted in a variety of new and evolving platforms for onthego interactive entertainment that appeal to a broad consumer base our efforts in wireless interactive entertainment are focused in two areas – packaged goods games for handheld game systems and downloadable games for mobile devices we expect sales of games for mobile devices to continue to be an important part of our business worldwide 

catalog sales  the video game industry is experiencing a change in retail sales patterns which is decreasing revenue from our catalog sales currently many console games experience sales cycles that are shorter than in the past to mitigate this trend we offer our consumers a directtoconsumer service such as “headtohead” play or other multiplayer options andor additional content available through our online service to further enhance the gaming experience and extend the time that consumers play our games after their initial purchase 

used games  certain of our customers sell used video games which are generally priced lower than new video games and do not result in revenue to the publisher of the games from the sale we have seen the market for used video games grow if our customers continue to increase their sales of used video games it could negatively affect our sales of new video games and have an adverse impact on our operating results 

concentration of sales among the most popular games  we see a larger portion of packaged goods games sales concentrated on the most popular titles and that those titles are typically sequels of prior games we have reacted to this trend by significantly reducing the number of games that we produce to provide greater focus on our most promising intellectual properties 

digital content distribution and services  consumers are spending an everincreasing portion of their money and time on interactive entertainment that is accessible online or through mobile digital devices such as smart phones or through social networks such as facebook and myspace we provide a variety of online delivered products and services many of our games that are available as packaged good products are also available through direct online download through the internet from websites we maintain and others that we license we also offer online delivered content and services that are addons or related to our packaged goods products such as additional game content or enhancements of multiplayer services further we provide other games content and services that are available only via electronic delivery such as internetonly games and game services and games for mobile devices advances in mobile technology have resulted in a variety of new and evolving devices that are being used to play games by an everbroadening base of consumers we have responded to these advances in technology and consumer acceptance of digital distribution by offering subscription services online downloads for a onetime fee and advertisingsupported free games and game sites we expect online delivery of games and game services to be an increasing part of our business going forward 

  

  

recent developments 

acquisition of playfish limited on november 9 2009 we acquired all of the outstanding shares of playfish limited “playfish™” for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 308 million in cash and equity in addition we may be required to pay additional variable cash consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance milestones through december 31 2011 this additional consideration is limited to a maximum of 100 million playfish is a developer of freetoplay social games that can be played on social networking platforms 

fiscal 2010 restructuring plan in fiscal year 2010 we announced details of a restructuring plan this plan includes a narrowing of our product portfolio to provide greater focus on titles with higher margin opportunities under this plan we reduced our workforce by approximately 1200 employees and have been 1 consolidating or closing various facilities 2 eliminating certain titles and 3 incurring it and other costs to assist in reorganizing certain activities the majority of these actions were completed by march 31 2010 

since the inception of this plan through march 31 2010 we have incurred charges of approximately 116 million overall including charges incurred through march 31 2010 we expect to incur total cash and noncash charges between 140 million and 145 million by march 31 2012 these charges consist primarily of 1 employeerelated costs approximately 65 million 2 intangible asset impairment costs abandoned rights to intellectual property costs and other costs to assist in the reorganization of our business support functions approximately 35 million 3 facilities exit costs approximately 25 million and 4 other reorganizational costs including it and consulting costs approximately 20 million 

employee stock option exchange program  on october 21 2009 we launched a voluntary employee stock option exchange program “exchange program” to permit our eligible employees to exchange outstanding eligible options for a lesser number of restricted stock units shares of restricted stock in canada only or new options in china only to be granted under our 2000 equity incentive plan the “equity plan” the exchange program offer period began on october 21 2009 and ended on november 18 2009 

options eligible for the exchange program were those options granted prior to october 21 2008 that had an exercise price per share greater than 2818 which was the 52week high trading price of our common stock measured as of the start date of the exchange program as reported on the nasdaq global select market and that upon conversion using the exchange ratio applicable for such options resulted in four or more shares of restricted stock units shares of restricted stock or new options as the case may be 

the exchange program resulted in options to purchase approximately 16561000 shares of our common stock being exchanged for restricted stock units to acquire approximately 4996000 shares approximately 923000 shares of restricted stock awards and new options to purchase approximately 18000 shares 

due to the structure of the exchange program as a “valueforvalue” exchange for the eligible options tendered for exchange and certain assumptions we are required to use regarding the eligible options for accounting purposes we will recognize an incremental accounting charge of approximately 70 million over the vesting period of the restricted stock units restricted stock and options issued in the exchange program in addition to recognizing any remaining unrecognized expense for the stock options surrendered in the exchange 

international operations and foreign currency exchange impact international sales  ie  revenue derived from countries other than canada and the united states are a fundamental part of our business net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately 45 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2010 and approximately 43 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2009 we believe that in order to succeed internationally it is important to locally develop content that is specifically directed toward local cultures and customs yearoveryear we estimate that foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on our net revenue of approximately 107 million or 3 percent for the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 during the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 the us dollar strengthened against other currencies including the euro and the british pound sterling in addition our international investments and our cash and cash equivalents 

  

   

denominated in foreign currencies are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency if the us dollar continues to strengthen against these currencies then foreign exchange rates may continue to have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations and our financial condition 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities contingent assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown as a result actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

revenue recognition sales returns allowances and bad debt reserves 

we derive revenue principally from sales of interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation 3 xbox 360 and wii pcs handheld game players such as the psp and nintendo ds and mobile devices such as cellular phones and smart phones including the apple iphone we evaluate revenue recognition based on the criteria set forth in financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” 985605 software revenue recognition  and staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 104 revenue recognition  we evaluate and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met 

 

  

  

  

 determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and management judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report in each period for example for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to 1 determine whether and when each element has been delivered 2 determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services 3 determine whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element and 4 allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver changes to any of these assumptions or management judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

depending on the type of product we may offer an online service that permits consumers to play against others via the internet andor receive additional updates or content from us for those games that consumers can play via the internet we may provide a “matchmaking” service that permits consumers to connect with other consumers to play against each other online in those situations where we do not require an additional fee for this 

  

  

online service we account for the sale of the software product and the online service as a “bundled” sale or multiple element arrangement in which we sell both the software product and the online service for one combined price we defer net revenue from sales of these games for which we do not have vsoe for the online service that we provided in connection with the sale and recognize the revenue from these games over the estimated online service period which is generally estimated to be six months beginning in the month after shipment in addition for some software products we also provide updates or additional content “digital content” to be delivered via the internet that can be used with the original software product in many cases we separately sell digital content for an additional fee however some purchased digital content can only be accessed via the internet  ie  the consumer never takes possession of the digital content we account for online transactions in which the consumer does not take possession of the digital content as a service transaction and accordingly we recognize the associated revenue over the estimated service period in other transactions at the date we sell the software product we have an obligation to provide incremental unspecified digital content in the future without an additional fee in these cases we account for the sale of the software product as a multiple element arrangement and recognize the revenue on a straightline basis over the estimated period of game play 

determining whether a transaction constitutes an online service transaction or a digital content download of a product requires judgment and can be difficult the accounting for these transactions is significantly different revenue from product downloads is generally recognized when the download is made available assuming all other recognition criteria are met revenue from an online game service is recognized as the service is rendered if the service period is not defined we recognize the revenue over the estimated service period determining the estimated service period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage in addition determining whether we have an implicit obligation to provide incremental unspecified future digital content without an additional fee can be difficult 

product revenue including sales to resellers and distributors “channel partners” is recognized when the above criteria are met we reduce product revenue for estimated future returns price protection and other offerings which may occur with our customers and channel partners price protection represents the right to receive a credit allowance in the event we lower our wholesale price on a particular product the amount of the price protection is generally the difference between the old price and the new price in certain countries we have stockbalancing programs for our pc and video game system software products which allow for the exchange of these software products by resellers under certain circumstances it is our general practice to exchange software products or give credits rather than to give cash refunds 

in certain countries from time to time we decide to provide price protection for our software products when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances we analyze historical returns current sellthrough of distributor and retailer inventory of our software products current trends in retail and the video game segment changes in customer demand and acceptance of our software products and other related factors in addition we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods 

in the future actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold software products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms product updates or competing software products for example the risk of product returns andor price protection for our software products may continue to increase as the playstation 2 console moves through its lifecycle while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters these estimates are inherently subjective accordingly if our estimates changed our returns and price protection reserves would change which would impact the total net revenue we report for example if actual returns andor price protection were significantly greater than the reserves we have established our actual results would decrease our reported total net revenue conversely if actual returns andor price protection were significantly less than our reserves this would increase our reported total net revenue in addition if our estimates of returns and price protection related to onlineenabled packaged goods software products change the amount of deferred net revenue we recognize in the future would change 

  

   

significant management judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends and historical experience depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly 

fair value estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item in order to fairly present our financial statements without an independent market or another representative transaction determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion on the appropriate accounting 

there are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value these include 1 the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value 2 the income approach which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example future cash flows or future earnings to a single present value amount and 3 the cost approach which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset for many of our fair value estimates including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets and acquired inprocess technology we use the income approach using the income approach requires the use of financial models which require us to make various estimates including but not limited to 1 the potential future cash flows for the asset or liability being measured 2 the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows 3 the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows and 4 the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium making these cash flow estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate our financial results may be negatively impacted furthermore relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact to the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached for example a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired 

while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments 

business combinations  we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities and contingencies assumed acquired inprocess technology and contingent consideration issued in a business combination our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets and acquired inprocess technology are amortized over various estimated useful lives furthermore a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount to recognize as goodwill an asset that is not amortized determining the fair value of assets acquired requires an assessment of the highest and best use or the expected price to sell the asset and the related expected future cash flows determining the fair value of acquired inprocess technology also requires an assessment of our expectations related to the use of that asset determining the fair value of an assumed liability requires an assessment of the expected cost to transfer the liability determining the fair value of contingent consideration issued requires an assessment of the expected future cash flows over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled and applying a discount rate that appropriately captures a market participant’s view of the risk associated with the obligation this fair value assessment is also required in periods subsequent to a business combination such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

assessment of impairment of goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets current accounting standards require that we assess the recoverability of our finite lived acquisitionrelated intangible assets and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets is potentially impaired in order to determine if a potential 

  

  

impairment has occurred management must make various assumptions about the estimated fair value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash flows for some assets our estimated fair value is dependent upon predicting which of our products will be successful this success is dependent upon several factors which are beyond our control such as which operating platforms will be successful in the marketplace also our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules 

we are required to perform a twostep approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount our reporting units are determined by the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which 1 discrete financial information is available and 2 segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component we are required to perform the impairment test at least annually by applying a fair valuebased test the first step measures for impairment by applying fair valuebased tests at the reporting unit level the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 

to determine the fair value of each reporting unit used in the first step we use a combination of the market approach which utilizes comparable companies’ data andor the income approach which utilizes discounted cash flows each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include longterm growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables these estimates and assumptions have to be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment our estimates for market growth our market share and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and certain external sources and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business our business consists of developing marketing and distributing video game software using both established and emerging intellectual properties and our forecasts for emerging intellectual properties are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information and have an inherently higher risk of accuracy if future forecasts are revised they may indicate or require future impairment charges we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

assessment of impairment of shortterm investments marketable equity securities and other investments we periodically review our shortterm investments marketable equity securities and other investments for impairment our shortterm investments consist of securities with remaining maturities greater than three months at the time of purchase and our marketable equity securities consist of investments in common stock of publicly traded companies both are accounted for as availableforsale securities unrealized gains and losses on our shortterm investments and marketable equity securities are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity net of tax until either 1 the security is sold or 2 we determine that the fair value of the security has declined below its adjusted cost basis and the decline is otherthantemporary realized gains and losses on our shortterm investments and marketable equity securities are calculated based on the specific identification method and are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income net and losses on strategic investments net respectively determining whether the decline in fair value is otherthantemporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each security the ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge including the credit quality of the issuer the duration that the fair value has been less than the adjusted cost basis severity of the impairment reason for the decline in value and potential recovery period the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the investees and our intent to sell and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value any contractual terms impacting the prepayment or settlement process as well as if we would be required to sell an investment due to liquidity or contractual reasons before its anticipated recovery during the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we recognized impairment charges of 26 million 57 million and 109 million respectively on our marketable equity securities our ongoing consideration of these factors could result in additional impairment charges in the future which could have a material impact on our financial results 

  

   

our other investments consist principally of nonvoting preferred shares in two companies whose common stock is publicly traded and are accounted for under the cost method under this method these investments are recorded at cost until we determine that the fair value of the investment has fallen below its adjusted cost basis and that such declines are otherthantemporary we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in the carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required based primarily on the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the investees during the fiscal years ended march 31 2009 and 2008 we recognized impairment charges of 10 million and 9 million respectively on our other investments we did not recognize any impairment charges in fiscal year 2010 on our other investments 

assessment of inventory obsolescence we regularly review inventory quantities onhand we write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products inventory writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market value based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently difficult to assess at the point of a loss recognition a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

stockbased compensation 

we are required to estimate the fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant we recognize compensation costs for stockbased payment transactions to employees based on their grantdate fair value on a straightline approach over the service period for which such awards are expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock is determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock on the date of grant the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and our 2000 employee stock purchase plan “espp” respectively is determined using the blackscholes valuation model the determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding subjective and complex variables such as expected employee exercise behavior and our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award generally our assumptions are based on historical information and judgment is required to determine if historical trends may be indicators of future outcomes the key assumptions for the blackscholes valuation calculation are 

 

  

  

  

 employee stockbased compensation expense is calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures forfeitures are revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates and an adjustment to stockbased compensation expense will be recognized at that time 

changes to our underlying stock price our assumptions used in the blackscholes option valuation calculation and our forfeiture rate as well as future equity granted or assumed through acquisitions could significantly impact the compensation expense we recognize 

royalties and licenses 

our royalty expenses consist of payments to 1 content licensors 2 independent software developers and 3 copublishing and distribution affiliates license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities 

  

  

professional sports organizations movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks copyrights personal publicity rights content andor other intellectual property royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games copublishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of products 

royaltybased obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid these royaltybased obligations are generally expensed to cost of goods sold generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on the total projected net revenue significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors including 1 the total number of titles subject to the contract 2 the timing of the release of these titles 3 the number of software units we expect to sell which can be impacted by a number of variables including product quality the timing of the title’s release and competition and 4 future pricing determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products accordingly if our future revenue projections change our effective royalty rates would change which could impact the amount and timing of royalty expense we recognize 

prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and copublishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product and therefore we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product accordingly payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred payments due after completion of the product primarily royaltybased in nature are generally expensed as cost of goods sold 

our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor when performance remains with the licensor we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract these obligations are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next twelve months as of march 31 2010 and march 31 2009 approximately 13 million and 37 million respectively of minimum guaranteed royalty obligations had been recognized 

each quarter we also evaluate the expected future realization of our royaltybased assets as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales any impairments or losses determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense impairments or losses determined postlaunch are charged to cost of goods sold we evaluate longlived royaltybased assets for impairment using undiscounted cash flows when impairment indicators exist unrecognized minimum royaltybased commitments are accounted for as executory contracts and therefore any losses on these commitments are recognized when the underlying intellectual property is abandoned  ie  cease use or the contractual rights to use the intellectual property are terminated during fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 we recognized impairment charges of 10 million loss charges of 43 million and loss and impairment charges of 4 million respectively the 10 million impairment charge recognized during the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 was primarily related to our fiscal 2010 restructuring this impairment is included in restructuring charges presented in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the loss charges in fiscal year 2009 primarily related to an amendment of a licensor agreement in which we terminated certain rights we previously had to use the licensor’s intellectual property 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carry forwards we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it 

  

   

is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified it is generally difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is significant negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years forecasts of future taxable income are considered to be less objective than past results particularly in light of the recent deterioration of the economic environment therefore cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 

in addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities the carry back of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law and the implementation of tax planning strategies evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence this evaluation involves assumptions about future activity certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets for example in determining the valuation allowance we recorded at june 30 2009 we did not include as a source of future taxable income the taxable temporary difference related to the accumulated tax depreciation on our headquarters facilities in redwood city california on july 13 2009 we purchased our redwood shores headquarters facilities concurrent with the expiration and extinguishment of the lessor’s financing agreements these facilities were subject to lease obligations to nonaffiliated parties which expired in july 2009 and had been accounted for as operating leases the total amount paid under the terms of the leases was 247 million of which 233 million related to the purchase price of the facilities and 14 million was for the loss on our lease obligation therefore in the fiscal quarter ended september 30 2009 we recorded a tax benefit of approximately 31 million consisting of approximately 6 million related to the loss on our lease obligation and a 25 million reduction in our valuation allowance due to the inclusion of a significant portion of the remaining taxable temporary difference as a source of future taxable income 

based on the assumptions and requirements noted above we have recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets in addition we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggest that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized 

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate these estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation as well as with respect to other matters such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities the ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations in addition changes in our business including acquisitions changes in our international corporate structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix and amount of income as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities valuation allowances applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate 

we historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly no us taxes have been provided thereon we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states

net revenue 

net revenue consists of sales generated from 1 video games sold as packaged goods and designed for play on hardware consoles such as the playstation 3 xbox 360 and wii pcs and handheld game players such as the sony psp and nintendo ds 2 video games for mobile devices such as cellular phones and smart phones including the apple iphone 3 digitally downloaded games and content and online services associated with these games 4 services in connection with some of our onlineenabled games 5 programming thirdparty web sites with our game content 6 allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products and 7 advertisements on our online web pages and in our games 

net revenue before revenue deferral a nongaap financial measure is provided in this section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” see “nongaap financial measures” below for an explanation of our use of this nongaap measure a reconciliation to the corresponding measure calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states is provided in the discussion below 

“revenue deferral” in this “net revenue” section includes the unrecognized revenue from 1 bundled sales of certain onlineenabled packaged goods and pc digital downloads for which either we do not have vsoe for the online service that we provide in connection with the sale of the software or we have an obligation to provide future incremental unspecified digital content 2 certain packaged goods sales of massivelymultiplayer online roleplaying games and 3 sales of certain incremental digital content associated with our games which are types of “microtransactions” fluctuations in the revenue deferral are largely dependent upon the amounts of products that we sell with the online features and services previously discussed while the recognition of revenue deferral for a period is also dependent upon 1 the period of time the online features and services are to be provided and 2 the timing of the sale for example most revenue deferrals incurred in the first half of a fiscal year are recognized within the same fiscal year however virtually all of the revenue deferrals incurred in the last month of a fiscal year will be recognized in the subsequent fiscal year

nongaap financial measures 

net revenue before revenue deferral is a nongaap financial measure that excludes the impact of revenue deferral and the recognition of revenue deferral on net revenue related to packaged goods games and digital content we defer net revenue from sales of certain onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content for which we are not able to objectively determine the fair value as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states for software sales of the online service that we provided in connection with the sale we recognize the revenue from these games over the estimated online service period we also defer net revenue from sales of certain onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content for which we had an obligation to deliver incremental unspecified digital content in the future without an additional fee we recognize the revenue for these games on a straightline basis over the estimated life of the game 

we believe that excluding the impact of revenue deferral and the recognition of revenue deferral related to packaged goods games and digital content from our operating results is important to facilitate comparisons between years in understanding our underlying sales performance for the period 

we use this nongaap measure internally to evaluate our operating performance when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods and when assessing the performance of our management team while we believe that this nongaap financial measure is useful in evaluating our business this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap in addition this nongaap financial measure may not be the same as nongaap measures presented by other companies 

cost of goods sold 

cost of goods sold for our packagedgoods business consists of 1 product costs 2 certain royalty expenses for celebrities professional sports and other organizations and independent software developers 3 manufacturing royalties net of volume discounts and other vendor reimbursements 4 expenses for defective products 5 writeoffs of postlaunch prepaid royalty costs 6 amortization of certain intangible assets 7 personnelrelated costs and 8 warehousing and distribution costs we generally recognize volume discounts when they are earned from the manufacturer typically in connection with the achievement of unitbased milestones whereas other vendor reimbursements are generally recognized as the related revenue is recognized cost of goods sold for our online products consists primarily of data center and bandwidth costs associated with hosting our web sites credit card fees and royalties for use of thirdparty properties cost of goods sold for our web site advertising business primarily consists of server costs 

cost of goods sold for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were as follows in millions 

 

 during fiscal year 2010 cost of goods sold increased by 06 percent as a percentage of total net revenue as compared to fiscal year 2009 this increase was primarily due to a 631 million increase in deferred net revenue related to certain onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content for the twelve months ended march 31 2010 as compared to the twelve months ended march 31 2009 overall we estimate the increase in deferred net revenue related to certain onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content negatively impacted cost of goods sold as a percent of total net revenue by 77 percentage points the overall increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue was partially mitigated by 1 a greater percentage of net revenue from ea studio products which have a higher margin than our copublishing and distribution products which positively impacted cost of goods sold as a percentage of total revenue by approximately 31 percent and 2 ea studio products that we sold which had previously been written down to a lower costs basis and lower inventory write downs on our fiscal year 2010 releases as compared to our fiscal year 2009 releases which positively impacted cost of goods sold as a percentage of total revenue by approximately 21 percent 

  

  

marketing and sales 

marketing and sales expenses consist of personnelrelated costs related overhead costs and advertising marketing and promotional expenses net of qualified advertising cost reimbursements from third parties 

marketing and sales expenses for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were as follows in millions 

 

 marketing and sales expenses increased by 39 million or 6 percent in fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 the increase was primarily due to an increase of 56 million in marketing advertising and promotional expenses primarily to support our launch of new franchises and incremental spending on established franchises this increase was partially offset by an 15 million decrease in personnelrelated costs primarily resulting from a decrease in headcount as a result of our cost reduction initiatives 

marketing and sales expenses included vendor reimbursements for advertising expenses of 39 million and 31 million in fiscal years 2010 and 2009 respectively 

we expect marketing and sales expenses to remain flat in absolute dollars during fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related expenses of executive and administrative staff related overhead costs fees for professional services such as legal and accounting and allowances for doubtful accounts

 for fiscal year 2010 interest and other income net decreased by 28 million or 82 percent as compared to fiscal year 2009 primarily due to a decrease in interest income resulting from lower yields and balances on our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

income taxes 

income tax provision benefit for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were as follows in millions 

 

 our effective income tax rate was a tax benefit of 41 percent for fiscal year 2010 our effective income tax rate was 272 percent for fiscal year 2009 in fiscal year 2010 our effective tax rate differed from the us statutory tax rate of 350 percent due primarily to us losses for which no benefit is recognized tax charges related to our integration of playfish nonus losses with a reduced or zero tax benefit and nondeductible stockbased compensation expenses partially offset by benefits related to the resolution of examinations by taxing authorities and reductions in the valuation allowance on us deferred tax assets in fiscal year 2009 we recorded a tax provision instead of a tax benefit on the pretax loss due primarily to the deferred tax valuation allowance our effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 differed from the us statutory tax rate of 350 percent due primarily to the deferred tax valuation allowance nondeductible goodwill impairment nondeductible stockbased compensation expenses nondeductible losses on strategic investments losses in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the us rate of 350 percent and a loss on facility impairment for which the future tax benefit is uncertain and not more likely than not to be realized 

our effective income tax rates for fiscal year 2011 and future periods will depend on a variety of factors including changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance as well as changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions changes in our international structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix of income changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in our annual pretax income or loss we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our pretax consolidated income or loss as a result in absolute dollar terms our tax provision will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pretax income or loss than at higher levels in addition at lower levels of pretax income or loss our effective tax rate will be more volatile 

certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit 

  

  

of deferred tax assets for example in determining the valuation allowance we recorded at june 30 2009 we did not include as a source of future taxable income the taxable temporary difference related to the accumulated tax depreciation on our headquarters facilities in redwood city california on july 13 2009 we purchased our redwood shores headquarters facilities concurrent with the expiration and extinguishment of the lessor’s financing agreements these facilities were subject to lease obligations to nonaffiliated parties which expired in july 2009 and had been accounted for as operating leases the total amount paid under the terms of the leases was 247 million of which 233 million related to the purchase price of the facilities and 14 million was for the loss on our lease obligation therefore in the fiscal quarter ended september 30 2009 we recorded a tax benefit of approximately 31 million consisting of approximately 6 million related to the loss on our lease obligation and a 25 million reduction in our valuation allowance due to the inclusion of a significant portion of the remaining taxable temporary difference as a source of future taxable income 

the worker homeownership and business assistance act of 2009 “the act” was signed into law on november 6 2009 the act provides that taxpayers may elect to increase the carry back period for tax losses incurred in a taxable year beginning or ending in either 2008 or 2009 during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2009 we elected to increase the carry back period for tax losses incurred in fiscal year 2009 this election resulted in a reduction in the valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets due to an increase in the sources of taxable income from the extended carry back period as a result we recorded a tax benefit of approximately 28 million in the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2009 for the reduction in the valuation allowance 

we historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly no us taxes have been provided thereon we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 changes in cash flow 

during fiscal year 2010 we generated 152 million of cash from operating activities as compared to generating 12 million for fiscal year 2009 the increase in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to decreases in personnelrelated costs and external development and contracted services as part of our cost reduction initiatives as well as a reduction in incentivebased compensation payments 

for fiscal year 2010 we generated 710 million of cash proceeds from maturities and sales of shortterm investments our primary use of cash in nonoperating activities consisted of 1 611 million used to purchase shortterm investments 2 305 million in capital expenditures of which 233 million was used to purchase our redwood shores headquarters facilities 3 283 million used for acquisitions of which 275 million net of cash acquired was used to fund our acquisition of playfish and 4 a 100 million increase in acquisitionrelated restricted cash for contingent consideration in connection with our acquisition of playfish 

shortterm investments and marketable equity securities 

due to our mix of fixed and variable rate securities our shortterm investment portfolio is susceptible to changes in shortterm interest rates as of march 31 2010 our shortterm investments had gross unrealized gains of 2 million or less than 1 percent of the total in shortterm investments and gross unrealized losses of less than 1 million or less than 1 percent of the total in shortterm investments from time to time we may liquidate some or all of our shortterm investments to fund operational needs or other activities such as capital expenditures business combinations or stock repurchase programs depending on which shortterm investments we liquidate to fund these activities we could recognize a portion or all of the gross unrealized gains or losses 

the fair value of our marketable equity securities decreased to 291 million as of march 31 2010 from 365 million as of march 31 2009 this decrease was due to 1 a 31 million decrease in the unrealized gains on our investments 2 impairment charges of 26 million recognized on our investment in the9 and 3 a 17 million decrease in the cost basis of our investment in the9 resulting from the sale of a portion of this investment 

receivables net 

our gross accounts receivable balances were 423 million and 333 million as of march 31 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in our accounts receivable balance was primarily due to higher sales volumes in the 

  

   

fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 reserves for sales returns pricing allowances and doubtful accounts as of march 31 2010 and 2009 was flat at 217 million as a percentage of trailing nine month net revenue reserves increased from 6 percent as of march 31 2009 to 7 percent as of march 31 2010 we believe these reserves are adequate based on historical experience and our current estimate of potential returns pricing allowances and doubtful accounts 

inventories 

inventories decreased to 100 million as of march 31 2010 from 217 million as of march 31 2009 primarily as a result of lower rock band inventory 

other current assets and other assets 

other current assets increased to 239 million as of march 31 2010 from 216 million as of march 31 2009 while other assets increased to 175 million as of march 31 2010 from 115 million as of march 31 2009 other current assets and other assets combined increased by 83 million primarily due to a 100 million increase in acquisitionrelated restricted cash for contingent consideration in connection with our acquisition of playfish 

accounts payable 

accounts payable decreased to 91 million as of march 31 2010 from 152 million as of march 31 2009 primarily due to payments related to our inventory purchases and royalty payables 

accrued and other current liabilities 

our accrued and other current liabilities decreased to 717 million as of march 31 2010 from 723 million as of march 31 2009 the 6 million decrease was primarily due to a 93 million decrease in accrued royalties this decrease was partially offset by 1 a 39 million increase in contingent consideration in connection with our acquisition of playfish and 2 an increase of 35 million in our accrued compensation and benefits 

deferred income taxes net 

our net deferred income tax asset position increased by 22 million as of march 31 2010 as compared to march 31 2009 primarily due to 1 an increase of 12 million for tax credit and loss carryovers in canada and the united kingdom and 2 a net increase of 5 million in us deferred taxes for decreases in the valuation allowance offset by changes in the netting of deferred taxes with liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 

financial condition 

we believe that cash cash equivalents shortterm investments marketable equity securities cash generated from operations and available financing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months including working capital requirements capital expenditures and potentially future acquisitions or strategic investments we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position facilitate expansion pursue strategic acquisitions and investments or to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise there can be no assurance however that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms if at all or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 

the loan financing arrangements supporting our redwood city headquarters leases described in the “offbalance sheet commitments” section below expired in july 2009 on july 13 2009 we purchased our redwood shores headquarters facilities comprised of approximately 660000 square feet concurrent with the expiration and extinguishment of the lessor’s financing agreements these facilities were subject to lease obligations to nonaffiliated parties which expired in july 2009 and had previously been accounted for as operating leases the total amount paid under the terms of the leases was 247 million of which 233 million related to the purchase price of the facilities and 14 million was for the loss on our lease obligation 

  

  

as of march 31 2010 approximately 734 million of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and 161 million of our marketable equity securities were domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions while we have no plans to repatriate these funds to the united states in the short term if we choose to do so we would be required to accrue and pay additional taxes on any portion of the repatriation where no united states income tax had been previously provided 

we have a “shelf” registration statement on form s3 on file with the sec this shelf registration statement which includes a base prospectus allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus we would use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes including for working capital financing capital expenditures research and development marketing and distribution efforts and if opportunities arise for acquisitions or strategic alliances pending such uses we may invest the net proceeds in interestbearing securities in addition we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time 

our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those related to customer demand and acceptance of our products our ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due successfully achieving our product release schedules and attaining our forecasted sales objectives the impact of acquisitions and other strategic transactions in which we may engage the impact of competition economic conditions in the united states and abroad the seasonal and cyclical nature of our business and operating results risks of product returns and the other risks described in the “risk factors” section included in part i item 1a of this report 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

development celebrity league and content licenses payments and commitments 

the products we produce in our studios are designed and created by our employee designers artists software programmers and by nonemployee software developers “independent artists” or “thirdparty developers” we typically advance development funds to the independent artists and thirdparty developers during development of our games usually in installment payments made upon the completion of specified development milestones contractually these payments are generally considered advances against subsequent royalties on the sales of the products these terms are set forth in written agreements entered into with the independent artists and thirdparty developers 

in addition we have certain celebrity league and content license contracts that contain minimum guarantee payments and marketing commitments that may not be dependent on any deliverables celebrities and organizations with whom we have contracts include fifa fifpro foundation fapl football association premier league limited and dfl deutsche fußball liga gmbh german soccer league professional soccer national basketball association professional basketball pga tour and tiger woods professional golf national hockey league and nhl players’ association professional hockey warner bros harry potter national football league properties players inc and red bear inc professional football collegiate licensing company collegiate football and basketball espn content in ea sports games hasbro inc most of hasbro’s toy and game intellectual properties and the estate of robert ludlum robert ludlum novels and films these developer and content license commitments represent the sum of 1 the cash payments due under nonroyaltybearing licenses and services agreements and 2 the minimum guaranteed payments and advances against royalties due under royaltybearing licenses and services agreements the majority of which are conditional upon performance by the counterparty these minimum guarantee payments and any related marketing commitments are included in the table below 

  

   

the following table summarizes our minimum contractual obligations as of march 31 2010 and the effect we expect them to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions 

 

  

  

 the amounts represented in the table above reflect our minimal cash obligations for the respective fiscal years but do not necessarily represent the periods in which they will be expensed in our consolidated financial statements 

in addition to what is included in the table above as of march 31 2010 we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling 277 million of which approximately 35 million is offset by prior cash deposits to tax authorities for issues pending resolution for the remaining liability we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 

in connection with our acquisition of playfish on november 9 2009 we may be required to pay additional variable cash consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance milestones through december 31 2011 the additional consideration is limited to a maximum of 100 million 

subsequent to march 31 2010 we entered into various licensor and development agreements with third parties which contingently commits us to pay up to 170 million at various dates through fiscal year 2016 no single licensor and development agreement represented greater than onethird of the total 170 million 

related person transaction 

prior to becoming chief executive officer of electronic arts john riccitiello was a cofounder and managing partner of elevation partners lp and also served as chief executive officer of vgh which we acquired in january 2008 at the time of the acquisition mr riccitiello held an indirect financial interest in vgh resulting from his interest in the entity that controlled elevation partners lp and his interest in a limited partner of elevation partners lp elevation partners lp was a significant stockholder of vgh as a result of the acquisition mr riccitiello’s financial returns related to these interests including returns of deemed capital contributions were 24 million through may 2008 some of which mr riccitiello could be required to return depending on the performance of the elevation entities mr riccitiello has not received any additional payments related to the vgh acquisition to date however he could receive up to an additional 16 million plus any interest or other amounts earned thereon this amount could be reduced however by a variety of factors 

  

  

including investment losses of elevation if any as well as certain expenses of elevation that could offset partnership profits upon his separation from elevation partners lp mr riccitiello ceased to have any further control or influence over these factors 

from the commencement of negotiations with vgh at the direction of ea’s board of directors ea’s audit committee engaged directly with ea management independently from mr riccitiello to analyze and consider the potential benefits risks and material terms of the acquisition ea’s board of directors approved the acquisition after reviewing with ea’s management and members of the audit committee the terms of the acquisition and the potential benefits and risks thereof as well as mr riccitiello’s personal financial interest in vgh and the acquisition mr riccitiello recused himself from the board of directors meeting during the board’s deliberation of the acquisition and he did not vote on the acquisition 

offbalance sheet commitments 

lease commitments 

as of march 31 2010 we leased certain of our current facilities furniture and equipment under noncancelable operating lease agreements we were required to pay property taxes insurance and normal maintenance costs for certain of these facilities and any increases over the base year of these expenses on the remainder of our facilities 

on july 13 2009 we purchased our redwood shores headquarters facilities comprised of approximately 660000 square feet concurrent with the expiration and extinguishment of the lessor’s financing agreements these facilities were subject to lease obligations to nonaffiliated parties which expired in july 2009 and had previously been accounted for as operating leases the total amount paid under the terms of the leases was 247 million of which 233 million related to the purchase price of the facilities and 14 million was for the loss on our lease obligation subsequent to our purchase we classified the facilities on our consolidated balance sheet as property and equipment net and depreciate the facilities acquired excluding land on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives 

director indemnity agreements 

we entered into indemnification agreements with each of the members of our board of directors at the time they joined the board to indemnify them to the extent permitted by law against any and all liabilities costs expenses amounts paid in settlement and damages incurred by the directors as a result of any lawsuit or any judicial administrative or investigative proceeding in which the directors are sued or charged as a result of their service as members of our board of directors 

inflation 

we believe the impact of inflation on our results of operations has not been significant in any of the past three fiscal years

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market prices which have experienced significant volatility in light of the global economic downturn market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks foreign currency option and forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below while we do not hedge our shortterm investment portfolio we protect our shortterm investment portfolio against different market risks including interest rate risk as discussed below our cash and cash equivalents portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase we also do not currently hedge our market price risk relating to our marketable equity securities and we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

cash flow hedging activities  from time to time we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreigncurrencydenominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing foreign currency option contracts that generally have maturities of 15 months or less these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges the derivative assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity the gross amount of the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of these hedge is subsequently reclassified into net revenue or research and development expenses as appropriate in the period when the forecasted transaction is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations in the event that the gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are deemed to be ineffective the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value if any is reclassified to interest and other income net in our consolidated statements of operations in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur or it becomes remote that they will occur within the defined hedge period the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income net on our consolidated statements of operations our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements in net revenue and research and development expenses as of march 31 2010 we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately 18 million in foreign currency and to sell approximately 30 million of foreign currencies all of the foreign currency option contracts outstanding as of march 31 2010 will mature in the next 12 months as of march 31 2009 we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately 19 million in foreign currency and to sell approximately 65 million of foreign currencies as of march 31 2010 and 2009 these foreign currency option contracts outstanding had a total fair value of 2 million in each year and are included in other current assets 

balance sheet hedging activities  we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities primarily intercompany receivables and payables the foreign currency forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three months or less and are transacted near monthend our foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as other current assets or other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses from changes in fair value are reported in interest and other income net in our consolidated statements of operations the gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying foreigncurrencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities which are also reported in interest and other income net in our consolidated statements of operations in certain cases the amount of such gains and losses will significantly differ from the amount of gains and losses recognized on the underlying foreigncurrencydenominated monetary asset or liability in which case our results will be impacted as of march 31 2010 we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell approximately 431 million in foreign 

  

  

currencies of this amount 293 million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars 127 million to purchase foreign currency in exchange for us dollars and 11 million to sell foreign currency in exchange for british pounds sterling as of march 31 2009 we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell approximately 63 million in foreign currencies of this amount 53 million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars 7 million to purchase foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and 3 million to sell foreign currencies in exchange for british pounds sterling the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was immaterial as of march 31 2010 and march 31 2009 

we believe the counterparties to these foreign currency forward and foreign currency option contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material the disruption in the global financial markets has impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of the disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations as of march 31 2010 a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value of the premiums on our foreign currency option contracts used in cash flow hedging of 1 million in both scenarios a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would have resulted in potential losses on our foreign currency forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of 42 million and 63 million respectively as of march 31 2010 this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar however all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and actual results may differ materially 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities however because shortterm investments mature relatively quickly and are required to be reinvested at the then current market rates interest income on a portfolio consisting of shortterm investments is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term investments additionally the contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to call prepay or otherwise settle the investments at prices less than the stated par value our investments are held for purposes other than trading also we do not use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio 

as of march 31 2010 and 2009 our shortterm investments were classified as availableforsale securities and consequently were recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of any tax effects in stockholders’ equity our portfolio of shortterm investments consisted of the following investment categories summarized by fair value as of march 31 2010 and 2009 in millions 

 

   

   

notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations at any time a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value in our shortterm investment portfolio as of march 31 2010 arising from potential changes in interest rates the modeling technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps 

 

 the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value in our shortterm investment portfolio as of march 31 2009 arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 

 

 market price risk 

the fair value of our marketable equity securities in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility and foreign currency risk for investments denominated in foreign currencies as of march 31 2010 and march 31 2009 our marketable equity securities were classified as availableforsale securities and consequently were recorded in our consolidated balance sheets at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of any tax effects in stockholders’ equity the fair value of our marketable equity securities was 291 million and 365 million as of march 31 2010 and march 31 2009 respectively 

  

  

our marketable equity securities have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by volatility in the public stock markets at any time a sharp change in market prices in our investments in marketable equity securities could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investments the following table presents hypothetical changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities as of march 31 2010 arising from changes in market prices of plus or minus 25 percent 50 percent and 75 percent

 competition 

we compete for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers with other video game companies as well as with other providers of different forms of entertainment such as motion pictures television social networking online casual entertainment and music our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large diversified corporations with global operations and greater financial resources than ours 

we also face competition from other video game companies and large media companies to obtain license agreements for the right to use some of the intellectual property included in our products some of these content licenses are controlled by the diversified media companies which in some cases have decided to publish their own games based on popular entertainment properties that they control rather than licensing the content to a video game company such as us 

competition in sales of packaged goods 

the packaged goods videogame business is characterized by the frequent launch of new games which may be sequels of popular game franchises or newly introduced game concepts there is also rapid technological innovation in the packaged goods game business as competing companies continually improve their use of the powerful platforms on which games are designed to run and extend the game experience through additional content and online services such as matchmaking and multiplayer functionality competition is also based on product quality and features timing of product releases brandname recognition availability and quality of ingame content access to distribution channels effectiveness of marketing and price 

for sales of packaged goods we compete directly with sony microsoft and nintendo each of which develop and publish software for their respective console platforms we also compete with numerous companies which like us develop and publish video games that operate on these consoles and on pcs and handheld game players these competitors include activision blizzard capcom infogrames entertainment sa koei konami lucasarts midway namco sega taketwo interactive thq and ubisoft diversified media companies such as fox disney time warner and viacom are also expanding their software game publishing efforts 

competition in games for wireless devices 

the wireless entertainment applications market segment for which we develop and publish games ring tones music video and wallpapers for wireless devices is characterized by frequent product introductions rapidly emerging new wireless platforms and new technologies as demand for applications continues to increase and the penetration of wireless devices that feature fullyfunctional browsers continues to grow we expect new competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources to develop and market competing applications as a result we expect competition in the wireless entertainment market segment to intensify 

current and potential competitors in the wireless entertainment applications market segment include major media companies traditional video game publishing companies wireless carriers wireless software providers and other companies that specialize in wireless entertainment applications we also compete with wireless content aggregators who pool applications from multiple developers and sometimes publishers and offer them to 

  

  

carriers or through other sales channels in addition new and existing competitors are beginning to offer wireless entertainment applications on an adsupported basis currently we consider our primary competitors in the wireless entertainment applications market segment to be gameloft glu mobile namco pangea and sony pictures 

competition in online gaming services 

the online  ie  internetbased games market segment is characterized by frequent product introductions new and evolving business models and new platforms as the proportion of households with a broadband connection continues to grow we expect new competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources toward developing online games services as a result we expect competition in the online games services market segment to intensify 

our current and potential competitors in the online games market segment include major media companies traditional video game publishing companies and companies that specialize in online games including social networking game companies in the massively multiplayer online game business our competitors include activision blizzard infogrames entertainment sa nc soft and sony competing providers of other kinds of online games include big fish msn popcap real aol yahoo and nexon 

intellectual property 

like other entertainment companies our business is significantly based on the creation acquisition exploitation and protection of intellectual property some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code patented technology and other technology and trade secrets that we use to develop our games and to make them run properly other intellectual property is in the form of audiovisual elements that consumers can see hear and interact with when they are playing our games — we call this form of intellectual property “content” 

we develop products from whollyowned intellectual properties we create within our own studios we also acquire the rights to include proprietary intellectual property in our products through acquisitions in addition we also obtain content and intellectual property through licenses and service agreements such as those with sports leagues and player associations movie studios and performing talent authors and literary publishers music labels music publishers and musicians these agreements typically limit our use of the licensed rights in products for specific time periods in addition our products that play on game consoles handhelds and wireless devices include technology that is owned by the console or wireless device manufacturer and licensed nonexclusively to us for use we also license technology from providers other than console and wireless device manufacturers while we may have renewal rights for some licenses our business and the justification for the development of many of our products is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain the intellectual property rights from the owners of these rights on reasonable terms and at reasonable rates 

we actively engage in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property we typically own the copyright to the software code as well as the brand or title name trademark under which our products are marketed we register copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries as appropriate 

as with other forms of entertainment our products are susceptible to unauthorized copying and piracy we typically distribute our pc products using copy protection technology digital rights management technology or other technological protection measures to prevent piracy and the use of unauthorized copies of our products in addition console manufacturers typically incorporate technological protections and other security measures in their consoles in an effort to prevent the use of unlicensed product we are actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect against unauthorized copying and piracy including monitoring online channels for distribution of pirated copies and participating in various industrywide enforcement initiatives education programs and legislative activity around the world 

  

   

significant relationships 

console manufacturers 

sony  under the terms of agreements we have entered into with sony computer entertainment inc and its affiliates we are authorized to develop and distribute diskbased software products and online content compatible with the playstation 2 playstation 3 and psp pursuant to these agreements we engage sony to supply playstation 2 playstation 3 and psp disks for our products 

microsoft  under the terms of agreements we have entered into with microsoft corporation and its affiliates we are authorized to develop and distribute dvdbased software products and online content compatible with the xbox 360 

nintendo  under the terms of agreements we have entered into with nintendo co ltd and its affiliates we are authorized to develop and distribute proprietary optical format disk products and cartridges compatible with the wii and the nintendo ds pursuant to these agreements we engage nintendo to supply wii proprietary optical format disk products and nintendo ds cartridges for our products 

retailers 

the console handheld and pc games that we publish are made available to consumers as packaged goods usually in bluray disc cd dvd cartridge or universal media disc format that are typically sold in retail stores and through online stores including our own online store in north america and europe our largest markets we sell these packaged goods products primarily to retailers including mass market retailers such as walmart electronics specialty stores such as best buy or game software specialty stores such as gamestop many of our pc products and related content such as booster packs expansion packs and smaller pieces of game content can also be purchased over the internet through digital download 

we generated approximately 96 percent of our north america net revenue from direct sales to retailers in fiscal year 2009 with the remaining net revenue being generated through a limited number of specialized and regional distributors in markets where we believe direct sales would not be economical we had direct sales to gamestop corp which represented approximately 14 percent 13 percent and 12 percent of total net revenue in fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively we also had direct sales to walmart stores inc which represented approximately 14 percent 12 percent and 13 percent of total net revenue in fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

wireless carriers 

we have agreements to distribute our wireless applications through more than 230 carriers in over 50 countries our customers download our applications to their wireless devices and their wireless carrier invoices them either a onetime or monthly subscription fee our carrier distribution agreements establish the fees to be retained by the carrier for distributing our applications these arrangements are typically terminable on short notice the agreements generally do not obligate the carriers to market or distribute any of our applications 

content licensors 

many of our products are based on or incorporate content and trademarks owned by others for example our products include rights licensed from third parties including major movie studios publishers artists authors celebrities traditional game and toy companies athletes and the major sports leagues and players associations 

ea partners 

through our ea partners group we team with external game developers and third party companies to provide these partners with a variety of services including development assistance publishing and distribution for example in fiscal year 2009 through agreements with crytek valve software and harmonix a subsidiary of viacom we released crysis warhead ®  left 4 dead  and rock band 2 respectively 

  

  

inventory working capital backlog manufacturing and suppliers 

we manage inventory by communicating with our customers prior to the release of our products and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct and territorybyterritory basis historically we have experienced high turnover of our products and the lead times on reorders of our products are generally short  eg approximately two to three weeks further as discussed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we have practices in place with our customers such as stock balancing and price protection that reduce product returns 

we typically ship orders immediately upon receipt to the extent that any backlog may or may not exist at the end of a reporting period it would be an unreliable indicator of future results of any period 

in many instances we are able to acquire materials on a volumediscount basis we have multiple potential sources of supply for most materials except for the disk or cartridge component of our playstation 3 playstation 2 psp wii and nintendo ds products 

seasonality 

our business is highly seasonal we have historically experienced our highest sales volume in the holiday season quarter ending in december and a seasonal low in sales volume in the quarter ending in june while our sales generally follow this seasonal trend there can be no assurance that this trend will continue in fiscal year 2009 we continued to defer the recognition of a significant amount of net revenue related to our onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content over an extended period of time  ie typically six months as a result the quarter in which we generate the highest sales volume may be different than the quarter in which we recognize the highest amount of net revenue our results can also vary based on a number of factors including title release dates consumer demand for our products shipment schedules and our revenue recognition policies 

employees 

as of march 31 2009 we had approximately 9100 regular fulltime employees of whom over 5100 were outside the united states we believe that our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is a critical factor in the successful development of our products and that our future success will depend in large measure on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees approximately 3 percent of our employees all of whom work for dice our swedish development studio are represented by a union guild or other collective bargaining organization

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs our business and financial performance could be harmed our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may harm our business and financial performance 

  

   

our business is highly dependent on the success and availability of video game hardware systems manufactured by third parties as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products for these systems 

we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play on video game hardware systems which we also refer to as “platforms” manufactured by third parties such as sony’s playstation 2 playstation 3 playstation portable microsoft’s xbox 360 nintendo’s wii and ds the success of our business is driven in large part by the commercial success and adequate supply of these video game hardware systems our ability to accurately predict which systems will be successful in the marketplace and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these systems we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of anticipated product ship dates a platform for which we are developing products may not succeed or may have a shorter life cycle than anticipated if consumer demand for the systems for which we are developing products is lower than our expectations our revenue will suffer we may be unable to fully recover the investments we have made in developing our products and our financial performance will be harmed alternatively a system for which we have not devoted significant resources could be more successful than we had initially anticipated causing us to miss out on meaningful revenue opportunities 

if we do not consistently meet our product development schedules our operating results will be adversely affected 

our business is highly seasonal with the highest levels of consumer demand and a significant percentage of our sales occurring in the december quarter in addition we seek to release many of our products in conjunction with specific events such as the release of a related movie or the beginning of a sports season or major sporting event if we miss these key selling periods for any reason including product delays or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have developed products our sales will suffer disproportionately likewise if a key event to which our product release schedule is tied were to be delayed or cancelled our sales would also suffer disproportionately for example we had initially planned to release an upcoming game harry potter and the halfblood prince ™ in november 2008 during our fiscal year ending march 31 2009 the game is now expected to be released in the summer of 2009 in conjunction with the release of the warner bros pictures’ film our ability to meet product development schedules is affected by a number of factors including the creative processes involved the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams required by the increasing complexity of our products and the platforms for which they are developed and the need to finetune our products prior to their release we have experienced development delays for our products in the past which caused us to push back release dates in the future any failure to meet anticipated production or release schedules would likely result in a delay of revenue andor possibly a significant shortfall in our revenue increase our development expense harm our profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different than anticipated 

our business is intensely competitive and “hit” driven if we do not deliver “hit” products and services or if consumers prefer our competitors’ products or services over our own our operating results could suffer 

competition in our industry is intense and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge in the united states and abroad while many new products and services are regularly introduced only a relatively small number of “hit” titles accounts for a significant portion of total revenue in our industry hit products or services offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause revenue generated from our products and services to fall below expectations if our competitors develop more successful products or services offer competitive products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering a better value proposition such as payforplay or subscriptionbased models or if we do not continue to develop consistently highquality and wellreceived products and services our revenue margins and profitability will decline 

  

  

if our marketing and advertising efforts fail to resonate with our customers our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs such as television and online advertising printing advertising retail merchandising website development and event sponsorship our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part upon the success of these programs if the marketing for our products and services fail to resonate with our customers particularly during the critical holiday season or during other key selling periods or if advertising rates or other media placement costs increase these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

as a result of the national and global economic downturn overall consumer spending has declined and retailers globally have taken a more conservative stance in ordering game inventory the decrease in discretionary consumer spending contributed to the decline in the anticipated demand for our products during the 2008 holiday selling season continued economic distress which may result in a further decrease in demand for our products particularly during key product launch windows could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could also increase the risk of material losses on our investments increase costs associated with developing and publishing our products increase the cost and decrease the availability of sources of financing and increase our exposure to material losses from bad debts any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results in addition the decline in our market capitalization and our expected financial performance indicated that a potential impairment of goodwill existed during the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 as a result we performed goodwill impairment tests for our reporting units in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  as a result of the goodwill impairment analysis we determined that our ea mobile reporting unit’s goodwill was impaired during the fiscal year ended march 31 2009 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 368 million related to our ea mobile reporting unit if we experience further deterioration in our market capitalization or our financial performance we could be required to recognize significant impairment charges in future periods 

our international net revenue is subject to currency fluctuations 

for the fiscal year ended march 31 2009 international net revenue comprised 43 percent of our total net revenue we expect foreign sales to continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue such sales may be subject to unexpected regulatory requirements tariffs and other barriers additionally foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies which may fluctuate against the us dollar in addition our international investments and our cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies are subject to currency fluctuations we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate some foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities primarily certain intercompany receivables and payables to a limited extent and foreign currency option contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions primarily related to a portion of the revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currency generated by our operational subsidiaries however these activities are limited in the protection they provide us from foreign currency fluctuations and can themselves result in losses the disruption in the global financial markets has also impacted many of the financial institutions with which we do business a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of the disruption in the financial markets could negatively impact our treasury operations including our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs accordingly our results of operations including our reported net revenue operating expenses and net income and financial condition can be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations especially the euro british pound sterling and canadian dollar 

  

   

volatility in the capital markets may adversely impact the value of our investments and could cause us to recognize significant impairment charges in our operating results 

our portfolio of shortterm investments and marketable equity securities is subject to volatility in the capital markets and to national and international economic conditions in particular our international investments can be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency and our shortterm investments are susceptible to changes in shortterm interest rates these investments are also impacted by declines in value attributable to the creditworthiness of the issuer from time to time we may liquidate some or all of our shortterm investments to fund operational needs or other activities such as capital expenditures strategic investments or business acquisitions or for other purposes if we were to liquidate these shortterm investments at a time when they were worth less than what we had originally purchased them for or if the obligor were unable to pay the full amount at maturity we could incur a significant loss similarly we hold marketable equity securities which have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by price and trading volume volatility in the public stock markets for the fiscal year ended march 31 2009 we recognized impairment charges of 30 million and 27 million on our neowiz and the9 common stock investments respectively as of may 14 2009 the aggregate fair market value of our investment in the9 had declined by approximately 21 million since march 31 2009 if we were to sell these marketable equity securities for a loss or if we were to determine that their value had become further impaired on an otherthantemporary basis we could be required to recognize additional impairment charges which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the majority of our sales are made to a relatively small number of key customers if these customers reduce their purchases of our products or become unable to pay for them our business could be harmed 

during the fiscal year ended march 31 2009 approximately 68 percent of our united states sales were made to seven key customers in europe our top ten customers accounted for approximately 44 percent of our sales in that territory during the fiscal year ended march 31 2009 worldwide we had direct sales to two customers gamestop corp and walmart stores inc which each represented approximately 14 percent of total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2009 as a result of the economic downturn retailers globally have taken a more conservative stance in ordering game inventory though our products are available to consumers through a variety of retailers the concentration of our sales in one or a few large customers could lead to a shortterm disruption in our sales if one or more of these customers significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to carry our products and could make us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers became unable to pay for our products or declared bankruptcy additionally our receivables from these large customers increase significantly in the december quarter as they make purchases in anticipation of the holiday selling season also having such a large portion of our total net revenue concentrated in a few customers could reduce our negotiating leverage with these customers if one or more of our key customers experience deterioration in their business or become unable to obtain sufficient financing to maintain their operations our business could be harmed 

our industry is cyclical driven by the periodic introduction of new video game hardware systems as we continue to move through the current cycle our industry growth may slow down and as a result our operating results may be difficult to predict 

video game hardware systems have historically had a life cycle of four to six years which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well the current cycle began with microsoft’s launch of the xbox 360 in 2005 and continued in 2006 when sony and nintendo launched their nextgeneration systems the playstation 3 and the wii respectively sales of software designed for these hardware systems represent the majority of our revenue so our growth and success is highly correlated to sales of videogame hardware systems while there are indications that this current cycle may be extended longer than prior cycles in part due to the growth of online services and content and the greater graphic and processing power of the current generation hardware we expect growth in the installed base of the current generation of video game systems to slow as we enter the back half of this cycle this slowdown in sales of video game players which may be exacerbated by the current economic environment may cause a corresponding slowdown in the growth of sales of video game software which could significantly affect our operating results consequently the decline in priorgeneration product sales particularly 

  

  

the playstation 2 may be greater or faster than we anticipate and sales of products for the new platforms may be lower or increase more slowly than we anticipate moreover development costs for the current cycle of video game systems continue to be greater on a pertitle basis than development costs for priorgeneration video game systems in addition in light of the current economic environment and where we stand in the current generation console cycle our industry may experience slower growth than in recent years as a result of these factors during the next several quarters and years we expect our operating results to be difficult to predict 

technology changes rapidly in our business and if we fail to anticipate or successfully implement new technologies in our games the quality timeliness and competitiveness of our products and services will suffer 

rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate sometimes years in advance which technologies we must implement and take advantage of in order to make our products and services competitive in the market therefore we usually start our product development with a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve we may not be able to achieve these goals or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly and effectively than we can in either case our products and services may be technologically inferior to our competitors’ less appealing to consumers or both if we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule of our products and services then we may delay their release until these technology goals can be achieved which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses alternatively we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies either to preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up with our competition which would increase our development expenses 

the video game hardware manufacturers are among our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of andor access to our video game products if they do not approve our products we will be unable to ship to our customers 

our agreements with hardware licensors such as sony for the playstation 3 microsoft for the xbox 360 and nintendo for the wii typically give significant control to the licensor over the approval and manufacturing of our products which could in certain circumstances leave us unable to get our products approved manufactured and shipped to customers these hardware licensors are also among our chief competitors generally control of the approval and manufacturing process by the hardware licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently while we believe that our relationships with our hardware licensors are currently good the potential for these licensors to delay or refuse to approve or manufacture our products exists such occurrences would harm our business and our financial performance 

we also require compatibility code and the consent of microsoft sony and nintendo in order to include online capabilities in our products for their respective platforms as online capabilities for video game systems become more significant microsoft sony and nintendo could restrict the manner in which we provide online capabilities for our products if microsoft sony or nintendo refused to approve our products with online capabilities or significantly impacted the financial terms on which these services are offered to our customers our business could be harmed 

the video game hardware manufacturers set the royalty rates and other fees that we must pay to publish games for their platforms and therefore have significant influence on our costs if one or more of these manufacturers change their fee structure our profitability will be materially impacted 

in order to publish products for a video game system such as the xbox 360 playstation 3 or wii we must take a license from microsoft sony and nintendo respectively which gives these companies the opportunity to set the fee structure that we must pay in order to publish games for that platform similarly these companies have retained the flexibility to change their fee structures or adopt different fee structures for online gameplay and other new features for their consoles the control that hardware manufacturers have over the fee structures for their platforms and online access could adversely impact our costs profitability and margins because publishing products for video game systems is the largest portion of our business any increase in fee structures would significantly harm our ability to generate profits 

  

   

if we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to include intellectual property owned by others in our games or to maintain or acquire the rights to publish or distribute games developed by others we will sell fewer hit titles and our revenue profitability and cash flows will decline competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and reduce our profitability 

many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our ea sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players’ associations similarly many of our other hit franchises such as the godfather harry potter and lord of the rings are based on key film and literary licenses in addition one of our most successful products in fiscal year 2009 rock band 2  was a game which we did not develop but for which we had acquired distribution rights competition for these licenses and rights is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses and rights or obtain additional licenses or rights with significant commercial value our revenues profitability and cash flows will decline significantly competition for these licenses may also drive up the advances guarantees and royalties that we must pay to licensors and developers which could significantly increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

our business is subject to risks generally associated with the entertainment industry any of which could significantly harm our operating results 

our business is subject to risks that are generally associated with the entertainment industry many of which are beyond our control these risks could negatively impact our operating results and include the popularity price and timing of our games and the platforms on which they are played economic conditions that adversely affect discretionary consumer spending changes in consumer demographics the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted 

if we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel we will be unable to effectively conduct our business 

the market for technical creative marketing and other personnel essential to the development and marketing of our products and management of our businesses is extremely competitive our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of executives and key creative talent if we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need or replace key employees following their departure our ability to develop and manage our business will be impaired 

acquisitions investments and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties dilution to our investors and other negative consequences 

we have engaged in evaluated and expect to continue to engage in and evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions including 1 acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets 2 minority investments in strategic partners and 3 investments in new interactive entertainment businesses for example online and mobile games any of these strategic transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations although we regularly search for opportunities to engage in strategic transactions we may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities we may not be able to consummate potential acquisitions or investments or an acquisition or investment we do consummate may not enhance our business or may decrease rather than increase our earnings the process of acquiring and integrating a company or business or successfully exploiting acquired intellectual property or other assets could divert a significant amount of resources as well as our management’s time and focus and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures particularly for a large acquisition additional risks and variations of the foregoing risks we face include 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 future acquisitions and investments could also involve the issuance of our equity and equitylinked securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses such as stockbased compensation any of the foregoing factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating performance that could have otherwise been achieved by us on a standalone basis our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights which could harm our business 

from time to time third parties may assert against us alleged patent copyright trademark personal publicity rights or other intellectual property rights to technologies products or deliverypayment methods that are important to our business although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement for example we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from certain individuals and companies who have acquired patent portfolios for the sole purpose of asserting such claims against other companies in addition many of our products are highly realistic and feature materials that are based on real world examples which may be the subject of intellectual property infringement claims of others from time to time we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims existing or future infringement claims against us whether valid or not may be time consuming and expensive to defend such claims or litigations could require us to pay damages and other costs stop selling the affected products redesign those 

  

   

products to avoid infringement or obtain a license all of which could be costly and harm our business in addition many patents have been issued that may apply to potential new modes of delivering playing or monetizing game software products and services such as those that we produce or would like to offer in the future we may discover that future opportunities to provide new and innovative mode of game play and game delivery to consumers may be precluded by existing patents that we are unable to license on reasonable terms 

from time to time we may become involved in other legal proceedings which could adversely affect us 

we are currently and from time to time in the future may become subject to legal proceedings claims litigation and government investigations or inquiries which could be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations in addition the outcome of any legal proceedings claims litigation investigations or inquiries may be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

our business is subject to increasing regulation and the adoption of proposed legislation we oppose could negatively impact our business 

legislation is continually being introduced in the united states at the local state and federal levels for the establishment of government mandated rating requirements or restrictions on distribution of entertainment software based on content to date most courts that have ruled on such legislation have ruled in a manner favorable to the interactive entertainment industry other countries have adopted or are considering laws regulating or mandating ratings requirements on entertainment software content and certain foreign countries already allow government censorship of entertainment software products adoption of government ratings system or restrictions on distribution of entertainment software based on content could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers and compliance with new and possibly inconsistent regulations for different territories could be costly or delay the release of our products 

as we increase the online delivery of our products and services we are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet in addition laws and regulations relating to user privacy data collection and retention content advertising and information security have been adopted or are being considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation furthermore any failure on our part to comply with these laws or application of these laws in an unanticipated manner may harm our business 

our products are subject to the threat of piracy and unauthorized copying 

entertainment software piracy is a persistent problem in our industry the growth in peertopeer networks and other channels to download pirated copies of our products the increasing availability of broadband access to the internet and the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures used with our products all have contributed to an expansion in piracy though we take technical steps to make the unauthorized copying of our products more difficult as do the manufacturers of consoles on which our games are played these efforts may not be successful in controlling the piracy of our products 

while legal protections exist to combat piracy preventing and curbing infringement through enforcement of our intellectual property rights may be difficult costly and time consuming particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights further the scope of the legal protection of copyright and prohibitions against the circumvention of technological protection measures to protect copyrighted works are often under scrutiny by courts and governing bodies the repeal or weakening of laws intended to combat piracy protect intellectual property and prohibit the circumvention of technological protection measures could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect against piracy these factors could have a negative effect on our growth and profitability in the future 

  

  

if one or more of our titles were found to contain hidden objectionable content our business could suffer 

throughout the history of our industry many video games have been designed to include certain hidden content and gameplay features that are accessible through the use of ingame cheat codes or other technological means that are intended to enhance the gameplay experience however in several recent cases hidden content or features have been found to be included in other publishers’ products by an employee who was not authorized to do so or by an outside developer without the knowledge of the publisher from time to time some hidden content and features have contained profanity graphic violence and sexually explicit or otherwise objectionable material in a few cases the entertainment software ratings board “esrb” has reacted to discoveries of hidden content and features by reviewing the rating that was originally assigned to the product requiring the publisher to change the game packaging andor fining the publisher retailers have on occasion reacted to the discovery of such hidden content by removing these games from their shelves refusing to sell them and demanding that their publishers accept them as product returns likewise consumers have reacted to the revelation of hidden content by refusing to purchase such games demanding refunds for games they have already purchased and refraining from buying other games published by the company whose game contained the objectionable material 

we have implemented preventative measures designed to reduce the possibility of hidden objectionable content from appearing in the video games we publish nonetheless these preventative measures are subject to human error circumvention overriding and reasonable resource constraints in addition to the extent we acquire a company without similar controls in place the possibility of hidden objectionable content appearing in video games developed by that company but for which we are ultimately responsible could increase if a video game we published were found to contain hidden objectionable content the esrb could demand that we recall a game and change its packaging to reflect a revised rating retailers could refuse to sell it and demand we accept the return of any unsold copies or returns from customers and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand that we refund their money this could have a material negative impact on our operating results and financial condition in addition our reputation could be harmed which could impact sales of other video games we sell if any of these consequences were to occur our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed 

if we ship defective products our operating results could suffer 

products such as ours are extremely complex software programs and are difficult to develop manufacture and distribute we have quality controls in place to detect defects in the software media and packaging of our products before they are released nonetheless these quality controls are subject to human error overriding and reasonable resource constraints therefore these quality controls and preventative measures may not be effective in detecting defects in our products before they have been reproduced and released into the marketplace in such an event we could be required to recall a product or we may find it necessary to voluntarily recall a product andor scrap defective inventory which could significantly harm our business and operating results 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 

we are also required to estimate what our tax obligations will be in the future although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the estimation process and applicable laws are inherently uncertain and our estimates are not binding on tax authorities the tax laws’ treatment of software and internetbased transactions is particularly uncertain and in some cases currently applicable tax laws are illsuited to address these kinds of transactions apart from an adverse resolution of these uncertainties our effective tax rate also could be adversely affected by our profit level by changes in our business or changes in our structure resulting from the reorganization of our business and operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the elections we make changes in applicable tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions or changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as well as other factors in 

  

   

fiscal year 2009 we recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets consisting of 232 million related to deferred tax assets that existed as of our fiscal year ended march 31 2008 plus an additional 134 million against deferred tax assets recorded during fiscal year 2009 in addition we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggests that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized further our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should our ultimate tax liability exceed our estimates our income tax provision and net income or loss could be materially affected 

we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our consolidated pretax income or loss as a result in absolute dollar terms our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pretax income or loss than at higher levels in addition at lower levels of pretax income or loss our effective tax rate will be more volatile 

we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under examination by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations changes in our business or changes in applicable tax rules will not have an adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition 

furthermore as we expand our international operations adopt new products and new distribution models implement changes to our operating structure or undertake intercompany transactions in light of changing tax laws expiring rulings acquisitions and our current and anticipated business and operational requirements our tax expense could increase 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves 

our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting policies promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies due to recent economic events the frequency of accounting policy changes may accelerate policies affecting software revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products and services through fiscal year 2007 for accounting purposes vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” existed for the online service related to our onlineenabled packaged software products accordingly we allocated the revenue collected from the sale of the software product between the online service offered and the software product and recognized the amounts allocated to each element separately however starting in fiscal year 2008 vsoe did not exist for the online service and we began to recognize all of the revenue from bundle sales on a deferred basis over an estimated online service period which we estimate to be six months beginning in the month after shipment we expect that a more significant portion of our games will be onlineenabled in the future and we could be required to recognize the related revenue over an extended period of time rather than at the time of sale in addition fasb interpretation no 48 has affected the way we account for income taxes and has had a material impact on our financial results and our adoption of sfas no 141revised 2007 “sfas no 141r” business combinations  will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for material acquisitions consummated after march 28 2009 similarly changes in accounting standards relating to stockbased compensation require us to recognize significantly greater expense than we had been recognizing prior to the adoption of the new standard as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue and taxes could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

we rely on business partners in many areas of our business and our business may be harmed if they are unable to honor their obligations to us 

we rely on various business partners including thirdparty service providers vendors licensing partners development partners and licensees among others in many areas of our business in many cases these third 

  

  

parties are given access to sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support to our teams these third parties may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it the failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies or the failure of the third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies could result in a disruption to our business operations further the disruption in the financial markets and the global economic downturn may adversely affect our business partners and they may not be able to continue honoring their obligations to us some of our business partners are highlyleveraged or small businesses that may be particularly vulnerable in the current economic environment alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner or vendor if we lose one or more significant business partners our business could be harmed 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors above as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts’ earnings estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts’ and investors’ expectations to factors affecting the entertainment computer software internet media or electronics industries to our ability to successfully integrate any acquisitions we may make or to national or international economic conditions in particular economic downturns may contribute to the public stock markets experiencing extreme price and trading volume volatility these broad market fluctuations have and could continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock

about electronic arts 

we develop market publish and distribute video game software and content that can be played by consumers on a variety of platforms including video game consoles such as the playstation ® 3 microsoft xbox 360™ and nintendo wii™ personal computers handheld game players such as the playstation ® portable “psp™” and the nintendo ds™ and wireless devices such as cellular phones and smart phones including the apple iphone some of our games are based on content that we license from others  eg  madden nfl football harry potter™ and fifa soccer and some of our games are based on our own whollyowned intellectual property  eg  the sims™ need for speed™ dead space™ and pogo™ our goal is to publish titles with global massmarket appeal which often means translating and localizing them for sale in nonenglish speaking countries in addition we also attempt to create software game “franchises” that allow us to publish new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the same property examples of this franchise approach are the annual iterations of our sportsbased products  eg  madden nfl football ncaa ® football and fifa soccer whollyowned properties that can be successfully sequeled  eg  the sims need for speed and battlefield and titles based on longlived literary andor movie properties  eg  the godfather ® and harry potter 

special note regarding deferred net revenue 

many of our software products are developed with the ability to connect to the internet depending on the type of product this feature permits consumers to play against others via the internet andor receive additional updates or content from us for those games that consumers can play via the internet we may provide a “matchmaking” online service which permits consumers to connect with other consumers to play against each other in those situations where we do not separately sell this online service we account for the sale of the software product as a “bundle” sale or multiple element arrangement in which we sell both the software product and the online service for one combined price through fiscal year 2007 for accounting purposes vsoe existed for the online service accordingly we allocated the revenue collected from the sale of the software product between the online service offered and the software product and recognized the amounts allocated to each element separately however starting in fiscal year 2008 vsoe did not exist for the online service and we began to recognize all of the revenue from the sale of these bundle sales on a deferred basis over an estimated online service period which we estimate to be six months beginning in the month after shipment 

in addition we also provide updates or additional content “digital content” for some software products to be delivered via the internet for some software products at the date of sale we had an obligation to make available for download via the internet incremental unspecified future digital content without an additional fee in those transactions we also accounted for the sale of the software product as a bundle sale and recognized the revenue on a deferred basis over the period in which we expect to make available the incremental unspecified digital content 

on a quarterly basis the deferral amount will vary significantly depending upon the number of titles we release the timing of their release sales volume returns and price protection provided for these onlineenabled software products in addition we expense the cost of goods sold related to these transactions during the period in which the product is delivered rather than on a deferred basis which inherently creates volatility in our reported gross profit percentages 

  

   

financial results 

total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2009 was 4212 million up 547 million as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2008 at march 31 2008 deferred net revenue associated with sales of onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content increased by 355 million as compared to march 31 2007 directly reducing the amount of reported net revenue during the year ended march 31 2008 at march 31 2009 deferred net revenue associated with sales of onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content decreased by 126 million as compared to march 31 2008 directly increasing the amount of reported net revenue during the year ended march 31 2009 without these changes in deferred net revenue reported net revenue increased by approximately 66 million during fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 fiscal year 2009 net revenue was driven primarily by rock band 2 and spore ™ 

net loss for the fiscal year ended march 31 2009 was 1088 million as compared to a net loss of 454 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2008 diluted loss per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2009 was 340 as compared to a diluted loss per share of 145 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2008 net loss increased for fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 primarily as a result of 1 the recognition of 368 million of goodwill impairment for our ea mobile reporting unit 2 recognition of 362 million related to an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of which 232 million related to us deferred tax assets that existed as of our fiscal year ended march 31 2008 3 a 322 million increase in cost of goods sold and 4 a 317 million increase in research and development and marketing and sales costs these were partially offset by 1 an increase of 547 million in net revenue due to increased sales of our games and 2 a decrease of 135 million in acquired inprocess technology primarily due to our acquisition of vgh in 2008 

during fiscal year 2009 we generated 12 million of cash in operating activities as compared to generating 338 million for fiscal year 2008 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to an increase in external development costs marketing and advertising costs and personnelrelated expenses 

trends in our business 

economic environment as a result of the national and global economic downturn overall consumer spending has declined retailers globally have taken a more conservative stance in ordering game inventory the decrease in retail orders contributed to the decline in anticipated demand for our products during the 2008 holiday selling season we remain cautious about our future sales in light of the current economic environment and the impact it has had on our retailers 

current generation game consoles video game hardware systems have historically had a life cycle of four to six years which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well the current cycle began with microsoft’s launch of the xbox 360 in 2005 and continued in 2006 when sony and nintendo launched their nextgeneration systems the playstation 3 and the wii respectively unlike past cycles we believe this current cycle may be extended partly due to the growth of online services and content and the greater graphic and processing power of the currentgeneration hardware as a result we expect the growth in the installed base of the xbox 360 the playstation 3 and the wii to slow down as we enter the back half of this cycle therefore in light of the current economic environment and where we stand in the current generation console cycle our industry may experience slower growth than in recent years 

online content and services  in addition to selling packaged goods games we also provide a variety of electronically delivered products and services many of our games that are available as packaged goods products are also available by direct electronic download through the internet from websites that we maintain and others that we license we also offer electronically delivered content and services that are addons or related to our packaged goods products  eg  game enhancements or matchmaking services and other games content and services that are available only via electronic delivery such as games for wireless devices and internetonly games and game services electronically delivered content and services are offered to consumers as subscription services electronic downloads for a onetime fee or on an advertisingsupported basis we have made 

  

  

significant investments in electronically delivered content and services and we believe that this will become an increasingly important part of our business over time 

mobile platforms  advances in mobile technology have resulted in a variety of new and evolving platforms for onthego interactive entertainment that appeal to a broad consumer base our efforts in mobile interactive entertainment are focused in two areas – packaged goods games for handheld game systems and downloadable games for wireless devices we expect sales of games for wireless devices to continue to be an important part of our business worldwide 

recent developments 

fiscal 2009 cost reduction plan in fiscal year 2009 we announced details of a cost reduction plan this plan includes a narrowing of our product portfolio a reduction in our worldwide workforce of approximately 11 percent or 1100 employees the closure of 10 facilities and reductions in other variable costs and capital expenditures we consolidated and reorganized two of our labels the sims and ea casual entertainment into the ea play label in order to capture synergies and generate greater efficiencies between the two labels we now have three labels — ea games ea sports and ea play we believe a more focused product portfolio and a reduction in total operating expenses are better strategies for operating in the current environment 

international operations and foreign currency exchange impact international sales are a fundamental part of our business net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately 43 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2009 and approximately 47 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2008 our international net revenue was primarily driven by sales in europe and to a much lesser extent in asia we believe that in order to succeed internationally it is important to locally develop content that is specifically directed toward local cultures and customs yearoveryear we estimate that foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on our net revenue of approximately 30 million or 1 percent for the fiscal year ended march 31 2009 during the fiscal year ended march 31 2009 the us dollar strengthened against other currencies including the euro and the british pound sterling in addition our international investments and our cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency if the us dollar continues to strengthen against these currencies then foreign exchange rates may continue to have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations and our financial condition 

goodwill impairment adverse economic conditions including the decline in our market capitalization and our expected financial performance indicated that a potential impairment of goodwill existed during the fiscal year ended march 31 2009 as a result we performed goodwill impairment tests for our reporting units in accordance with sfas no 142 and concluded the ea mobile reporting unit’s goodwill was impaired during the fiscal year ended march 31 2009 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 368 million related to our ea mobile reporting unit substantially all of our goodwill associated with our ea mobile reporting unit was derived from our acquisition of jamdat mobile inc in february 2006 

deferred income tax valuation allowance we account for income taxes under sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry forwards sfas no 109 additionally requires that a valuation allowance must be established against deferred tax assets when for purposes of sfas no 109 it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we are required under sfas no 109 to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified sfas no 109 provides that it is difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years forecasts of future taxable income are considered to be less objective than past results particularly in light of the recent deterioration of the economic environment therefore cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment in making our assessment we are also required to consider the scheduled reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities carry back of future deductible amounts allowed under current tax law and tax planning strategies based on these requirements we 

  

   

have recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets consisting of 232 million related to deferred tax assets that existed as of our fiscal year ended march 31 2008 plus an additional 134 million against deferred tax assets recorded during fiscal year 2009 in addition we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggests that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities contingent assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown as a result actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

revenue recognition sales returns allowances and bad debt reserves 

we derive revenue principally from sales of interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation 3 xbox 360 and wii pcs handheld game players such as the psp and nintendo ds and wireless devices such as cellular phones and smart phones including the apple iphone we evaluate revenue recognition based on the criteria set forth in statement of position “sop” 972 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop 989 modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions and staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 104 revenue recognition  we evaluate and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met 

 

  

  

  

 determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and management judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report in each period for example for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to 1 determine whether and when each element has been delivered 2 determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services 3 determine whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element and 4 allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver changes to any of these assumptions or management judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period for example in connection with some of our packaged goods product sales we offer an online service without an additional fee prior to fiscal year 2008 we were able to determine vsoe for the online service to be delivered therefore we were able to allocate the total price received from the combined product and online service sale between these two elements and recognize the related revenue separately however starting in fiscal 

  

  

year 2008 vsoe no longer existed for the online service to be delivered for certain platforms and all revenue from these transactions is recognized over the estimated online service period more specifically starting in fiscal year 2008 we began to recognize the revenue from sales of certain onlineenabled packaged goods on a straightline basis over a six month period beginning in the month after shipment accordingly this relatively small change from having vsoe for the online service to no longer having vsoe has had a significant effect on our reported results 

in addition for some software products we also provide updates or additional content “digital content” to be delivered via the internet that can be used with the original software product in many cases we separately sell digital content for an additional fee however some purchased digital content can only be accessed via the internet  ie  the consumer never takes possession of the digital content we account for online transactions in which the consumer does not take possession of the digital content as a service transaction and accordingly we recognize the associated revenue over the estimated service period in other transactions at the date we sell the software product we have an obligation to provide incremental unspecified digital content in the future without an additional fee in these cases we account for the sale of the software product as a multiple element arrangement and recognize the revenue on a straightline basis over the estimated life of the game 

determining whether a transaction constitutes an online service transaction or a digital content download of a product requires judgment and can be difficult the accounting for these transactions is significantly different revenue from product downloads is generally recognized when the download is made available assuming all other recognition criteria are met revenue from an online game service is recognized as the service is rendered if the service period is not defined we recognize the revenue over the estimated service period determining the estimated service period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage in addition determining whether we have an implicit obligation to provide incremental unspecified future digital content without an additional fee can be difficult 

product revenue including sales to resellers and distributors “channel partners” is recognized when the above criteria are met we reduce product revenue for estimated future returns price protection and other offerings which may occur with our customers and channel partners price protection represents the right to receive a credit allowance in the event we lower our wholesale price on a particular product the amount of the price protection is generally the difference between the old price and the new price in certain countries we have stockbalancing programs for our pc and video game system software products which allow for the exchange of these software products by resellers under certain circumstances it is our general practice to exchange software products or give credits rather than to give cash refunds 

in certain countries from time to time we decide to provide price protection for our software products when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances we analyze historical returns current sellthrough of distributor and retailer inventory of our software products current trends in retail and the video game segment changes in customer demand and acceptance of our software products and other related factors in addition we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods 

in the future actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold software products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms product updates or competing software products for example the risk of product returns andor price protection for our software products may continue to increase as the playstation 2 console moves through its lifecycle while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters these estimates are inherently subjective accordingly if our estimates changed our returns and price protection reserves would change which would impact the total net revenue we report for example if actual returns andor price protection were significantly greater than the reserves we have established our actual results would decrease our reported total net revenue conversely if actual returns andor price protection were significantly less than our reserves this would increase our reported total net revenue in addition if our estimates of returns and price protection related to onlineenabled packaged goods software products change the amount of net deferred revenue we recognize in the future would change 

  

   

significant management judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends and historical experience depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly 

fair value estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item in order to fairly present our financial statements without an independent market or another representative transaction determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion on the appropriate accounting 

there are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value these include 1 the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value 2 the income approach which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example future cash flows or future earnings to a single present amount and 3 the cost approach which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset for many of our fair value estimates including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets and acquired inprocess technology we use the income approach using the income approach requires the use of financial models which require us to make various estimates including but not limited to 1 the potential future cash flows for the asset or liability being measured 2 the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows 3 the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows and 4 the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium making these cash flow estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate our financial results may be negatively impacted furthermore relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact to the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached for example a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired 

while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments 

business combinations  we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and acquired inprocess technology in a business combination our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives and acquired inprocess technology is expensed upon consummation furthermore a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount to recognize as goodwill an asset that is not amortized determining the fair value of acquired assets requires an assessment of the expected use of the asset and the related expected future cash flows determining the fair value of an assumed liability requires an assessment of the expected cost to extinguish the liability and determining the fair value of acquired inprocess technology requires an assessment of our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired inprocess technology such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our financial statements 

assessment of impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets current accounting standards require that we assess the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets is potentially impaired in order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred management must make various assumptions about the estimated fair value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash flows for some assets our estimated fair value is dependent upon predicting which of our products will be successful this success is dependent upon several factors which are beyond our control such as which operating platforms will be successful in the marketplace also our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules 

  

  

sfas no 142 requires a twostep approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount our reporting units are determined by the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which both 1 discrete financial information is available and 2 segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component sfas no 142 requires that the impairment test be performed at least annually by applying a fairvaluebased test the first step measures for impairment by applying fairvaluebased tests at the reporting unit level the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fairvaluebased tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 

to determine the fair values of the reporting units used in the first step we use a combination of the market approach which utilizes comparable companies’ data andor the income approach or discounted cash flows each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include longterm growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables these estimates and assumptions have to be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment our estimates for market growth our market share and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and certain external sources and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business our business consists of developing marketing and distributing video game software using both established and emerging intellectual properties and our forecasts for emerging intellectual properties are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information and have an inherently higher risk of accuracy if future forecasts are revised they may indicate or require future impairment charges we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

assessment of impairment of shortterm investments marketable equity securities and other investments we periodically review our shortterm investments marketable equity securities and other investments for impairment our shortterm investments consist of securities with remaining maturities greater than three months at the time of purchase and our marketable equity securities consist of investments in common stock of publicly traded companies both are accounted for as availableforsale under the provisions of sfas no115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  as amended unrealized gains and losses on our shortterm investments and marketable equity securities are recorded to other comprehensive income net of tax until either 1 the security is sold or 2 we determine that the decline in the fair value of a security to a level below its cost basis is otherthantemporary determining whether the decline in fair value is otherthantemporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each security the ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge including the duration that the fair value has been less than the cost basis severity of the impairment reason for the decline in value and potential recovery period the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the investees and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value during the fiscal year ended march 31 2009 and 2008 we recognized impairment charges of 57 million and 109 million respectively on our marketable equity securities we did not recognize any impairment charges on our marketable equity securities during the fiscal year ended march 31 2007 our ongoing consideration of these factors could result in additional impairment charges in the future which could have a material impact on our financial results 

our other investments consist principally of nonvoting preferred shares in two companies whose common stock is publicly traded and are accounted for under the cost method as prescribed by accounting principles board “apb” no 18 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  as amended we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in the carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required based primarily on the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the investees during the fiscal years ended march 31 2009 and 2008 we recognized impairment charges of 10 million and 9 million respectively on our other investments we did not recognize any impairment charges during the fiscal year ended march 31 2007 

  

   

assessment of inventory obsolescence we regularly review inventory quantities onhand and in the retail channel we write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products inventory writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market value based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently difficult to assess at the point of a loss recognition a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

stockbased compensation 

we are required to estimate the fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant the estimated fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights granted pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan is determined using the blackscholes valuation model which requires us to make certain assumptions about the future determining the estimated fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding subjective and complex variables such as expected employee exercise behavior and our expected stock price volatility over the term of the award we estimated the following key assumptions for the blackscholes valuation calculation 

 

  

  

  

 changes to our underlying stock price our assumptions used in the blackscholes option valuation calculation and our forfeiture rate which is based on historical data as well as future equity granted or assumed through acquisitions could significantly impact compensation expense to be recognized in future periods 

royalties and licenses 

our royalty expenses consist of payments to 1 content licensors 2 independent software developers and 3 copublishing and distribution affiliates license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities professional sports organizations movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks copyrights personal publicity rights content andor other intellectual property royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games copublishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of product 

royaltybased obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid these royaltybased obligations are generally expensed to cost of goods sold generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on the total projected net revenue significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors including 1 the total number of titles subject to the contract 2 the timing of the release of these titles 3 the number of software units we expect to sell which can be impacted by a number of variables including product quality the timing of the title’s release and competition and 4 future pricing determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products accordingly if our future revenue projections change our effective royalty rates would change which could impact the amount and timing of royalty expense we recognize 

  

  

prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and copublishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product and therefore we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product accordingly payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred payments due after completion of the product primarily royaltybased in nature are generally expensed as cost of goods sold 

our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor when performance remains with the licensor we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract these obligations are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next twelve months as of march 31 2009 and 2008 approximately 37 million and 10 million respectively of minimum guaranteed royalty obligations had been recognized 

each quarter we also evaluate the future realization of our royaltybased assets as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales any impairments or losses determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense impairments or losses determined postlaunch are charged to cost of goods sold we evaluate longlived royaltybased assets for impairment based on the provisions of sfas no 144  ie  on an undiscounted cash flow basis when impairment indicators exist unrecognized minimum royaltybased commitments are accounted for as executory contracts and therefore any losses on these commitments are recognized when the underlying intellectual property is abandoned  ie  cease use or the contractual rights to use the intellectual property are terminated consistent with the provisions of sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  during fiscal years 2009 and 2008 we recognized loss charges of 43 million and loss and impairment charges of 4 million respectively related to our royalty agreements we had no loss or impairment charges during fiscal year 2007 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under sfas no 109 which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry forwards sfas no 109 additionally requires that a valuation allowance must be established against deferred tax assets when for purposes of sfas no 109 it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we are required under sfas no 109 to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified sfas no 109 provides that it is difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years forecasts of future taxable income are considered to be less objective than past results particularly in light of the recent deterioration of the economic environment therefore cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 

in addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities the carry back of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law and the implementation of tax planning strategies evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence and involve assumptions about future activity sfas no 109 provides that certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets for example when determining the valuation allowance we recorded in the fiscal year ended march 31 2009 we did not include as a source of future taxable income the accumulated tax depreciation on our headquarters facilities in redwood city california these facilities are subject to leases which expire in july 2009 and are accounted for as operating leases in accordance with sfas no 13 accounting for leases  if we are unable or decide not to renew these leases and instead acquire the facilities then we would be able to include a significant portion of the 

  

   

temporary differences representing approximately 46 million of deferred tax liabilities as a source of future taxable income and we would record a corresponding reduction in our valuation allowance 

based on the assumptions and requirements noted above we have recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets consisting of 232 million related to deferred tax assets that existed as of our fiscal year ended march 31 2008 plus an additional 134 million against deferred tax assets recorded during fiscal year 2009 in addition we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggests that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized 

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate these estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation as well as with respect to other matters such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities the ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations in addition changes in our business including acquisitions changes in our international corporate structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix and amount of income as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities valuation allowances applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate 

we historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly no us taxes have been provided thereon we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states 

results of operations 

our fiscal year is reported on a 52 or 53week period that ends on the saturday nearest march 31 our results of operations for the fiscal years ended march 31 2009 2008 and 2007 contained 52 weeks and ended on march 28 2009 march 29 2008 and march 31 2007 respectively for simplicity of disclosure all fiscal periods are referred to as ending on a calendar month end 

comparison of fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2008 

net revenue 

net revenue consists of sales generated from 1 video games sold as packaged goods and designed for play on hardware consoles such as the playstation 3 xbox 360 and wii pcs and handheld game players such as the sony psp and nintendo ds 2 video games for wireless devices such as cellular phones and smart phones including the apple iphone 3 interactive onlineenabled packaged goods digital content and online services associated with these games 4 services in connection with some of our online games 5 programming thirdparty web sites with our game content 6 allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products and 7 advertisements on our online web pages and in our games 

during fiscal years 2009 and 2008 we recognized total net revenue of 4212 million and 3665 million respectively our total net revenue during the fiscal years 2009 and 2008 includes 1203 million and 831 million respectively recognized from sales of certain onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content for which we were not able to objectively determine the fair value as defined by us generally accepted accounting principles for software sales of the online service that we provided in connection with the sale 

  

  

and the obligation we had to deliver incremental unspecified digital content in the future without an additional fee when we refer to deferral of net revenue in this “net revenue” section we mean the deferral of 1 the total net revenue from bundle sales of certain onlineenabled packaged goods and pc digital downloads for which either we do not have vsoe for the online service that we provide in connection with the sale of the software or we have an obligation to provide future incremental unspecified digital content 2 revenue from certain packaged goods sales of massivelymultiplayer online roleplaying games and 3 revenue from the sale of certain incremental content associated with our core subscription services that can only be played online which are types of “microtransactions” during the year ended march 31 2009 we recognized 126 million of deferred net revenue which increased our reported net revenue as compared to the deferral of 355 million of net revenue which decreased our reported net revenue for the year ended march 31 2008 

from a geographical perspective our total net revenue for the fiscal years ended march 31 2009 and 2008 was as follows in millions 

 

 the overall change in deferred net revenue for the fiscal years ended march 31 2009 and 2008 was as follows in millions 

 

 north america 

for fiscal year 2009 net revenue in north america was 2412 million driven by rock band 2 rock band and madden nfl 09  net revenue for fiscal year 2009 increased 24 percent or 470 million as compared to fiscal year 2008 from an operational perspective the increase in net revenue was driven by 1 a 259 million increase in net revenue from sales of titles for the wii 2 a 168 million increase in net revenue from sales of titles for the playstation 3 and 3 an 85 million increase in net revenue from sales of titles for the xbox 360 these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 94 million in net revenue from sales of titles for the playstation 2 

the recognition of deferred net revenue increased our reported net revenue by 50 million during the year ended march 31 2009 as compared to a decrease in our reported net revenue of 158 million for the year ended march 31 2008 

  

   

we expect net revenue for north america to decrease during fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 due to an expected increase in deferred net revenue related to our onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content

 europe 

for fiscal year 2009 net revenue in europe was 1589 million driven by fifa 09 need for speed undercover and rock band  net revenue for fiscal year 2009 increased 3 percent or 48 million as compared to fiscal year 2008 from an operational perspective the increase in net revenue was driven by 1 a 196 million increase in net revenue from sales of titles for the playstation 3 and 2 a 56 million increase in net revenue from sales of titles for the xbox 360 these increases were partially offset by 1 a 159 million decrease in net revenue from sales of titles for the playstation 2 2 a 39 million decrease in net revenue from sales of titles for the nintendo ds and 3 a 16 million decrease in net revenue from sales of titles for the pc 

the recognition of deferred net revenue increased our reported net revenue by 68 million during the year ended march 31 2009 as compared to a decrease in our reported net revenue due to the deferral of 169 million of net revenue for the year ended march 31 2008 

we estimate that foreign exchange rates primarily the british pound sterling decreased reported net revenue including the foreign exchange impact from deferred net revenue by approximately 19 million or 1 percent for the year ended march 31 2009 as compared to the year ended march 31 2008 excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates from net revenue we estimate that net revenue increased by approximately 67 million or 4 percent for the year ended march 31 2009 as compared to the year ended march 31 2008 

we expect net revenue for europe to decrease during fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 due to an expected increase in deferred net revenue related to our onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 changes in cash flow 

during fiscal year 2009 we generated 12 million of cash from operating activities as compared to generating 338 million for fiscal year 2008 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to an increase in external development costs advertising and marketing costs and personnelrelated expenses 

for fiscal year 2009 we generated 891 million of cash proceeds from maturities and sales of shortterm investments and 89 million in proceeds from sales of common stock through our stockbased compensation plans our primary use of cash in nonoperating activities consisted of 695 million used to purchase shortterm investments 115 million in capital expenditures and 58 million used for acquisitions 

shortterm investments and marketable equity securities 

due to our mix of fixed and variable rate securities our shortterm investment portfolio is susceptible to changes in shortterm interest rates as of march 31 2009 our shortterm investments had gross unrealized gains of 4 million or 1 percent of the total in shortterm investments and gross unrealized losses of less than 1 million or less than 1 percent of the total in shortterm investments from time to time we may liquidate some or all of our shortterm investments to fund operational needs or other activities such as capital expenditures business acquisitions or stock repurchase programs depending on which shortterm investments we liquidate to fund these activities we could recognize a portion or all of the gross unrealized gains or losses 

marketable equity securities decreased to 365 million as of march 31 2009 from 729 million as of march 31 2008 this decrease was due to 1 a 307 million reduction in our unrealized gains and 2 impairment charges of 30 million and 27 million recognized on our neowiz and the9 common stock investments respectively 

receivables net 

our gross accounts receivable balances were 333 million and 544 million as of march 31 2009 and 2008 respectively the decrease in our accounts receivable balance was primarily due to lower sales volumes during 

  

  

the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 reserves for sales returns pricing allowances and doubtful accounts decreased in absolute dollars from 238 million as of march 31 2008 to 217 million as of march 31 2009 as a percentage of trailing nine month net revenue reserves decreased from 7 percent as of march 31 2008 to 6 percent as of march 31 2009 we believe these reserves are adequate based on historical experience and our current estimate of potential returns pricing allowances and doubtful accounts 

inventories 

inventories increased to 217 million as of march 31 2009 from 168 million as of march 31 2008 primarily as a result of an increase of 47 million of rock band and rock band 2 inventory 

other current assets and other assets 

other current assets decreased to 216 million as of march 31 2009 from 290 million as of march 31 2008 other assets decreased to 115 million as of march 31 2009 from 157 million as of march 31 2008 other current assets and other assets combined decreased by 116 million primarily due to 1 the impairment and subsequent reclassification of an asset classified as an asset held for sale in other current assets to property and equipment net in the amount of 48 million and 2 a decrease in prepaid and valueadded taxes of 33 million 

accounts payable 

accounts payable decreased to 152 million as of march 31 2009 from 182 million as of march 31 2008 primarily due to the timing of payments related to our inventory purchases 

accrued and other current liabilities 

our accrued and other current liabilities decreased to 723 million as of march 31 2009 from 730 million as of march 31 2008 the 7 million decrease was primarily due to 1 a 44 million decrease in accrued incentivebased compensation and 2 a 23 million decrease in accrued contingent liabilities related to certain of our acquisitions these decreases were partially offset by 1 an increase of 33 million in our deferred net revenue other and 2 a 30 million increase in royalties payable directly associated with the increase in our copublishing and distribution revenue and inventory 

deferred income taxes net 

our net deferred income tax asset position decreased by 229 million as of march 31 2009 as compared to march 31 2008 primarily due to the increase in the valuation allowance 

financial condition 

we believe that cash cash equivalents shortterm investments marketable equity securities cash generated from operations and available financing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months including working capital requirements capital expenditures and potentially future acquisitions or strategic investments we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position facilitate expansion pursue strategic acquisitions and investments or to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise there can be no assurance however that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms if at all or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 

on march 13 2008 we commenced an unsolicited 2600 per share cash tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of taketwo for a total purchase price of approximately 21 billion on may 9 2008 we received a commitment from certain financial institutions to provide us with up to 10 billion of senior unsecured term loan at any time until january 9 2009 to be used to provide a portion of the funds for the offer andor merger on 

  

   

august 18 2008 we allowed the tender offer to expire and on september 14 2008 we announced that we had terminated discussions with taketwo on september 26 2008 pursuant to the terms of the funding we received a notice from the financial institutions that had committed to provide us with the funding that in light of our decision not to make a proposal to acquire taketwo their commitment to provide the funding had terminated 

the loan financing arrangements supporting our redwood city headquarters leases described in the “offbalance sheet commitments” section below are scheduled to expire in july 2009 upon the expiration of the lease financing arrangements the terms of the leases provide for our purchase of the facilities for a purchase price of approximately 250 million however at any time prior to the expiration of the financing we may renegotiate the leases and the related financing arrangements or negotiate an alternative financing arrangement 

as of march 31 2009 approximately 925 million of our cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and marketable equity securities that was generated from operations was domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions while we have no plans to repatriate these funds to the united states in the short term if we choose to do so we would be required to accrue and pay additional taxes on any portion of the repatriation where no united states income tax had been previously provided 

we have a “shelf” registration statement on form s3 on file with the sec this shelf registration statement which includes a base prospectus allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus we would use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes including for working capital financing capital expenditures research and development marketing and distribution efforts and if opportunities arise for acquisitions or strategic alliances pending such uses we may invest the net proceeds in interestbearing securities in addition we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time 

our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those related to customer demand and acceptance of our products on new platforms and new versions of our products on existing platforms our ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due successfully achieving our product release schedules and attaining our forecasted sales objectives the impact of acquisitions and other strategic transactions in which we may engage the impact of competition economic conditions in the united states and abroad the seasonal and cyclical nature of our business and operating results risks of product returns and the other risks described in the “risk factors” section included in part i item 1a of this report 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

development celebrity league and content licenses payments and commitments 

the products we produce in our studios are designed and created by our employee designers artists software programmers and by nonemployee software developers “independent artists” or “thirdparty developers” we typically advance development funds to the independent artists and thirdparty developers during development of our games usually in installment payments made upon the completion of specified development milestones contractually these payments are generally considered advances against subsequent royalties on the sales of the products these terms are set forth in written agreements entered into with the independent artists and thirdparty developers 

in addition we have certain celebrity league and content license contracts that contain minimum guarantee payments and marketing commitments that may not be dependent on any deliverables celebrities and organizations with whom we have contracts include fifa fifpro foundation and fapl football association premier league limited professional soccer nascar stock car racing national basketball association professional basketball pga tour and tiger woods professional golf national hockey league and nhl players’ association professional hockey warner bros harry potter new line productions and saul zaentz company the lord of the rings red bear inc john madden national football

the following table summarizes our minimum contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of march 31 2009 and the effect we expect them to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions 

 

  

  

 the amounts represented in the table above reflect our minimal cash obligations for the respective fiscal years but do not necessarily represent the periods in which they will be expensed in our consolidated financial statements 

in addition to what is included in the table above as discussed in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we have adopted the provisions of fin no 48 as of march 31 2009 we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling 324 million of which approximately 56 million is offset by prior cash deposits to tax authorities for issues pending resolution for the remaining liability we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market prices which have experienced significant volatility in light of the global economic downturn market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks foreign currency option and forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below while we do not hedge our shortterm investment portfolio we protect our shortterm investment portfolio against different market risks including interest rate risk as discussed below our cash and cash equivalents portfolio consist of highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase we also do not currently hedge our market price risk relating to our marketable equity securities and we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

cash flow hedging activities  from time to time we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreigncurrencydenominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing option contracts that generally have maturities of 15 months or less these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges the derivative assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity and subsequently reclassified into net revenue or research and development expenses as appropriate in the period when the forecasted transaction is recorded the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value if any is reported in each period in interest and other income net in our consolidated statements of operations our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements in revenue and research and development expenses as of march 31 2009 we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately 19 million in foreign currency and to sell approximately 65 million of foreign currencies as of march 31 2009 these foreign currency option contracts outstanding had a total fair value of 2 million included in other current assets as of march 31 2008 we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately 48 million in foreign currencies and to sell approximately 254 million of foreign currencies as of march 31 2008 these foreign currency option contracts outstanding had a total fair value of 5 million included in other current assets 

balance sheet hedging activities  we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreigncurrencydenominated assets and liabilities primarily intercompany receivables and 

  

  

payables the forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three months or less and are transacted near monthend our foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 133 and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts are reported as other current assets or other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses from changes in fair value are reported in interest and other income net the gains and losses on these forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying foreigncurrencydenominated assets and liabilities which are also reported in interest and other income net in our consolidated statements of operations in certain cases the amount of such gains and losses will significantly differ from the amount of gains and losses recognized on the underlying foreign currency denominated asset or liability in which case our results will be impacted as of march 31 2009 we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell approximately 63 million in foreign currencies of this amount 53 million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars 7 million to purchase foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and 3 million to sell foreign currencies in exchange for british pounds sterling as of march 31 2008 we had forward foreign currency contracts to purchase and sell approximately 540 million in foreign currencies of this amount 479 million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars 48 million to purchase foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and 13 million to sell foreign currencies in exchange for british pounds sterling the fair value of our forward contracts was immaterial as of march 31 2009 and 2008 

the counterparties to these forward and option contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material the disruption in the global financial markets has impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of the disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations as of march 31 2009 a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would have resulted in potential losses in fair value of our option contracts used in cash flow hedging of 1 million in both scenarios a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would have resulted in potential losses on our forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of 6 million and 9 million respectively as of march 31 2009 this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar however all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and actual results may differ materially 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities however because shortterm investments mature relatively quickly and are required to be reinvested at the then current market rates interest income on a portfolio consisting of shortterm investments is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term investments additionally the contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to call prepay or otherwise settle the investments at prices less than the stated par value our investments are held for purposes other than trading also we do not use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio 

  

   

as of march 31 2009 and 2008 our shortterm investments were classified as availableforsale and consequently recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of any tax effects in stockholders’ equity our portfolio of shortterm investments consisted of the following investment categories summarized by fair value as of march 31 2009 and 2008 in millions 

 

 notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations at any time a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value in our shortterm investment portfolio as of march 31 2009 arising from potential changes in interest rates the modeling technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps 

 

 the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value in our shortterm investment portfolio as of march 31 2008 arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 

 

   

  

market price risk 

the value of our marketable equity securities in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility and foreign currency risk for investments denominated in foreign currencies as of march 31 2009 and 2008 our marketable equity securities were classified as availableforsale and consequently were recorded in our consolidated balance sheets at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of any tax effects in stockholders’ equity the fair value of our marketable equity securities was 365 million and 729 million as of march 31 2009 and march 31 2008 respectively in fiscal years 2009 and 2008 we recognized otherthantemporary impairment losses on our marketable equity securities of 57 million and 109 million respectively 

our marketable equity securities have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by volatility in the public stock markets at any time a sharp change in market prices in our investments in marketable equity securities could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investments the following table presents hypothetical changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities as of march 31 2009 arising from changes in market prices plus or minus 25 percent 50 percent and 75 percent

our ability to publish games across multiple platforms has been and will continue to be a cornerstone of our product strategy historically there have been multiple video game consoles and handheld game players available to consumers and there has been vigorous competition among hardware manufacturers in previous hardware cycles sony’s playstation and playstation 2 consoles have significantly outsold their competitors the current hardware cycle is characterized by fierce competition from three strong and viable competitors — microsoft’s xbox 360 the nintendo wii and sony’s playstation 3 in fiscal 2008 we developed and published 20 titles for the xbox 360 17 titles for the playstation 3 15 titles for the playstation 2 14 titles for the wii two titles for the xbox and one title for the nintendo gamecube the pc also continues to be an important interactive game platform in fiscal 2008 we published 29 titles for the pc including the macintosh similarly there is also competition in the handheld games hardware business where the nintendo ds and sony’s psp are both viable platforms in fiscal 2008 we published 12 titles for the nintendo ds nine titles for the psp and one title for the game boy advance many of our pc playstation 2 playstation 3 wii xbox 360 xbox and psp titles include online functionality which enables consumers to participate in online communities and play against one another via the internet 

our games span a diverse range of categories including actionadventure casual sports family fantasy racing music roleplaying simulation extreme sports and strategy we have created licensed and acquired a strong portfolio of intellectual property which we market and sell to a variety of consumers our portfolio of whollyowned properties includes established brands such as need for speed tm  the sims tm and battlefield and games scheduled to debut in fiscal 2009 such as spore tm  mirror’s edge tm and dead space tm  our portfolio of games based on licensed intellectual property includes sportsbased titles such as madden nfl football fifa soccer and tiger woods pga tour ®  and titles based on popular culture such as harry potter the godfather ®  and the yettobe released warhammer ® online  through our ea partners business we also codevelop copublish and distribute video games that are developed and published by other companies including the mtv gamesharmonix game rock band  beginning in fiscal 2009 we also expect to release video games based on board games and toys from hasbro including nerf monopoly and trivial pursuit  

 

another cornerstone of our strategy is to publish products that can be iterated or sequeled for example many of our sports products such as madden nfl football come out in a new edition each year other products such as the sims and godfather can be sequeled on a lessfrequent basis we refer to these successful iterated product families as “franchises” 

 

we develop our games using both internal and external resources we have development studios and related functions located worldwide such as bioware canada and united states black box canada blueprint united states bright light united kingdom criterion united kingdom dice sweden ea canada ea india ea los angeles united states ea montreal canada ea redwood shores united states ea romania ea salt lake city united states mythic entertainment united states pogo united states and china pandemic united states and australia phenomic germany the sims united states and tiburon united states we also have quality and assurance functions located in several countries such as china india korea singapore and spain and localization functions located in several countries such as france germany italy japan romania and spain we also engage thirdparties to assist with the development of our games at their own development and production studios

significant business developments in fiscal 2008

transition to new video game consoles 

 

the video game software industry is cyclical driven by video game hardware systems which have historically had a life cycle of four to six years the current cycle began with microsoft’s launch of the xbox 360 in 2005 and continued in 2006 when sony and nintendo launched their nextgeneration systems the playstation 3 and the wii respectively during fiscal 2008 the installed base of each of these systems continued to expand and as a result sales of our products for these systems have also increased significantly at the same time however demand for video games for priorgeneration systems particularly the original xbox and the nintendo gamecube has declined given its significant installed base and ongoing popularity outside of north america we expect to continue developing and marketing new titles for the playstation 2 in fiscal 2009 we only expect to release one title for the original xbox and no titles for the nintendo gamecube in fiscal 2009 the new systems are more complex than their predecessors  eg  some use multiprocessor technology new and unique game controllers online gameplay functionality and high definition video capabilities and development costs have been greater on a pertitle basis than development costs for priorgeneration video game systems

our central development services group which is part of our global publishing organization provides development services to our labels such as product localization quality assurance and certification motion capture art outsourcing and media mastering each service is essential to the development and publishing of our games by grouping these services together within a single centralized organization we expect to achieve cost savings through greater scale and efficiency while improving the overall quality of our games by providing more sophisticated and robust services than any of our labels could sustain on its own key components of central development services’ strategy are outsourcing to third parties and moving work offshore to lowercost markets 

 

competition 

 

our industry is intensely competitive we compete for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers with other video game companies as well as with other providers of different forms of entertainment such as motion pictures television social networking online casual entertainment and music our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large diversified corporations with global operations and greater financial resources than ours 

we also face heavy competition from other video game companies and large media companies to obtain license agreements for the right to use some of the intellectual property included in our products some of these content licenses are controlled by the diversified media companies which in some cases have decided to publish their own games based on popular entertainment properties that they control rather than licensing the content to a video game company such as us 

 

competition in sales of packaged goods 

 

our packaged goods business is characterized by the continuous introduction of innovative new titles and the development of new technologies competition is also based on product quality and features timing of product releases brandname recognition availability and quality of ingame content access to distribution channels effectiveness of marketing and price 

 

for sales of packaged goods we compete directly with sony microsoft and nintendo each of which develop and publish software for their respective console platforms we also compete with numerous companies which like us develop and publish video games that operate on these consoles and on pcs and handheld game players these competitors include activision atari capcom koei konami lucasarts midway namco sega taketwo interactive thq and ubisoft diversified media companies such as fox disney time warner viacom and vivendi are also expanding their software game publishing efforts 

 

competition in sales for cellular handsets 

 

the wireless entertainment applications market segment for which we develop and publish games ring tones music video and wallpapers for cellular handsets is highly competitive and characterized by frequent product introductions rapidly evolving wireless platforms and new technologies as demand for applications continues to increase we expect new competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources to develop and market competing applications as a result we expect competition in the wireless entertainment market segment to intensify 

 

current and potential competitors in the wireless entertainment applications market segment include major media companies traditional video game publishing companies wireless carriers wireless software providers and other companies that specialize in wireless entertainment applications we also compete with wireless content aggregators who pool applications from multiple developers and sometimes publishers and offer them to carriers or through other sales channels in addition new and existing competitors are beginning to offer wireless entertainment applications on an adsupported basis currently we consider our primary competitors in the wireless entertainment applications market segment to be disney fox mobile entertainment gameloft glu mobile handson mobile namco sony pictures and thq wireless 

 

competition in online gaming services 

 

the online games market segment is also highly competitive and characterized by frequent product introductions new and evolving business models and new platforms as the proportion of households with a broadband connection continues to grow we expect new competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources toward developing online games services as a result we expect competition in the online games services market segment to intensify 

 

our current and potential competitors in the online games market segment include major media companies traditional video game publishing companies and companies that specialize in online games in the massively multiplayer online game business our competitors include atari midway nc soft sony and vivendi games competing providers of other kinds of online games include msn popcap real aol yahoo and nexon 

 

intellectual property 

 

like other entertainment companies our business is significantly based on the creation acquisition exploitation and protection of intellectual property some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code patented technology and other technology and trade secrets that we use to develop our games and to make 

them run properly other intellectual property is in the form of audiovisual elements that consumers can see hear and interact with when they are playing our games — we call this form of intellectual property “content” 

 

our products embody a number of separate forms of intellectual property protection 

 

  

our products also may contain content licensed from others such as trademarks fictional characters storylines and software code 

 

we develop products from whollyowned intellectual properties we create within our own studios we also acquire the rights to include proprietary intellectual property in our products through acquisitions we also enter into content license agreements such as those with sports leagues and player associations movie studios and performing talent music labels music publishers and musicians these licenses are typically limited to use of the licensed rights in products for specific time periods in addition our products that play on game consoles handhelds and cellular handsets include technology that is owned by the console or handset manufacturer and licensed nonexclusively to us for use we also license technology from providers other than console and handset manufacturers while we may have renewal rights for some licenses our business and the justification for the development of many of our products is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain the intellectual property rights from the owners of these rights on reasonable terms and at reasonable rates 

 

as with other forms of entertainment our products are susceptible to unauthorized copying we typically distribute our pc products using copy protection technology that we license from other companies in addition console manufacturers typically incorporate security devices in their consoles in an effort to prevent the use of unlicensed products our primary protection against unauthorized use duplication and distribution of our products is enforcement of our copyright and trademark interests we typically own the copyright to the software code as well as the brand or title name trademark under which our products are marketed we register our copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries 

 

significant relationships 

 

console manufacturers 

 

sony under the terms of agreements we have entered into with sony computer entertainment inc and its affiliates we are authorized to develop and distribute diskbased software products and online content compatible with the playstation 2 playstation 3 and psp pursuant to these agreements we engage sony to supply playstation 2 playstation 3 and psp disks for our products

invoices them a onetime fee or monthly subscription fee our carrier distribution agreements establish the fees to be retained by the carrier for distributing our applications these arrangements are typically terminable on short notice the agreements generally do not obligate the carriers to market or distribute any of our applications 

 

content licensors 

 

many of our products are based on or incorporate content and trademarks owned by others for example our products include rights licensed from third parties including major movie studios publishers artists authors celebrities traditional game and toy companies athletes and the major sports leagues and players associations 

 

inventory working capital backlog manufacturing and suppliers 

 

for all of our labels we manage inventory by communicating with our customers prior to the release of our products and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct and territorybyterritory basis historically we have experienced high turnover of our products and the lead times on reorders of our products are generally short  eg approximately two to three weeks further as discussed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we have practices in place with our customers such as stock balancing and price protection that reduce product returns 

 

we typically ship orders immediately upon receipt to the extent that any backlog may or may not exist at the end of a reporting period it would be both coincidental and an unreliable indicator of future results of any period 

 

in many instances we are able to acquire materials on a volumediscount basis we have multiple potential sources of supply for most materials except for the disk component of our playstation 3 playstation 2 psp and wii and nintendo ds cartridges 

 

our online games and cellular handset applications are delivered digitally and therefore are not manufactured 

 

seasonality 

 

our business is highly seasonal we have historically experienced our highest sales volume in the holiday season quarter ending in december and a seasonal low in sales volume in the quarter ending in june starting in fiscal 2008 we began to defer the recognition of a significant amount of net revenue related to our onlineenabled packaged goods over an extended period of time  ie typically six months as a result the quarter in which we generate the highest sales volume may be different than the quarter in which we recognize the highest amount of net revenue our results can also vary based on a number of factors including title release dates consumer demand for our products shipment schedules and our revenue recognition policies 

 

employees 

 

as of march 31 2008 we had approximately 9000 regular fulltime employees of whom over 5100 were outside the united states we believe that our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is a critical factor in the successful development of our products and that our future success will depend in large measure on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees less than 3 percent of our employees all of whom work for dice our swedish development studio are represented by a union guild or other collective bargaining organization

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs our business and financial performance could be harmed our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may harm our business and financial performance 

our business is highly dependent on the success and availability of video game hardware systems manufactured by third parties as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products for these systems 

 

we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play on video game hardware systems which we also refer to as “platforms” manufactured by third parties such as sony’s playstation 2 and playstation 3 microsoft’s xbox 360 and nintendo’s wii the success of our business is driven in large part by the commercial success and adequate supply of these video game hardware systems our ability to accurately predict which systems will be successful in the marketplace and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these systems we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of anticipated product ship dates a platform for which we are developing products may not succeed or may have a shorter life cycle than anticipated if consumer demand for the systems for which we are developing products is lower than our expectations our revenue will suffer we may be unable to fully recover the investments we have made in developing our products and our financial performance will be harmed alternatively a system for which we have not devoted significant resources could be more successful than we had initially anticipated causing us to miss out on meaningful revenue opportunities 

 

our industry is cyclical driven by the transition from older video game hardware systems to new ones as we continue to move through the current cycle our operating results may be volatile and difficult to predict 

 

video game hardware systems have historically had a life cycle of four to six years which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well the current cycle began with microsoft’s launch of the xbox 360 in 2005 and continued in 2006 when sony and nintendo launched their nextgeneration systems the playstation 3 and the wii respectively during fiscal 2008 the installed base of each of these systems continued to expand and as a result sales of our products for these systems have also increased significantly at the same time however demand for video games for priorgeneration systems particularly the original xbox and the nintendo gamecube has declined significantly although we expect to continue developing and marketing new titles for the priorgeneration playstation 2 in fiscal 2009 we only expect to release one title for the original xbox and no titles for the nintendo gamecube as a result we expect our sales of video games for priorgeneration systems to continue to decline the decline in priorgeneration product sales particularly the playstation 2 may be greater or faster than we anticipate and sales of products for the new platforms may be lower or increase more slowly than we anticipate moreover we expect development costs for the new video game systems to continue to be greater on a pertitle basis than development costs for priorgeneration video game systems as a result of these factors during the next several quarters we expect our operating results to be more volatile and difficult to predict which could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly 

 

if we do not consistently meet our product development schedules our operating results will be adversely affected 

 

our business is highly seasonal with the highest levels of consumer demand and a significant percentage of our sales occurring in the december quarter in addition we seek to release many of our products in conjunction with specific events such as the release of a related movie or the beginning of a sports season or major sporting event if we miss these key selling periods for any reason including product delays or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have developed products our sales will suffer disproportionately likewise if a key event to which our product release schedule is tied were to be delayed or cancelled our sales would also suffer disproportionately our ability to meet product development schedules is affected by a number of factors including the creative processes involved the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams required by the increasing complexity of our products and the platforms for which they are developed and the need to finetune our products prior to their release we have experienced development delays for our products in the past which caused us to push back release dates in the future any failure to meet anticipated production or release schedules would likely result in a delay of revenue andor possibly a significant shortfall in our revenue harm our profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different than anticipated 

our business is intensely competitive and “hit” driven if we do not continue to deliver “hit” products and services or if consumers prefer our competitors’ products or services over our own our operating results could suffer 

 

competition in our industry is intense and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge in the united states and abroad while many new products and services are regularly introduced only a relatively small number of “hit” titles accounts for a significant portion of total revenue in our industry hit products or services offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause revenue generated from our products and services to fall below expectations if our competitors develop more successful products or services offer competitive products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering a better value proposition such as payforplay or subscriptionbased models or if we do not continue to develop consistently highquality and wellreceived products and services our revenue margins and profitability will decline 

 

we have recently reorganized our business and operating structure we may encounter a variety of issues in connection with the reorganization that could negatively impact our operating results financial condition and ability to report our financial results 

 

in an effort to streamline our internal decisionmaking processes improve our global focus and accelerate the process of bringing new ideas to market we have reorganized our business into several new divisions including four new labels the reorganization presents a number of ongoing operational challenges which if not successfully managed could cause our operating results to suffer in the nearterm andor delay or inhibit the anticipated benefits of the reorganization implementing any reorganization necessarily requires time and focus from all levels of the organization — time and focus that may be taken away from other business needs for example as our employees assume new responsibilities under the new structure their responsibilities under the old structure may not be successfully reassigned or adequately addressed which could result in operational problems that negatively impact our financial condition and operating results similarly as our employees’ roles and responsibilities change in a new structure it is possible that we could experience a greater loss of key personnel than we have historically 

 

technology changes rapidly in our business and if we fail to anticipate or successfully implement new technologies or the manner in which people play our games the quality timeliness and competitiveness of our products and services will suffer 

 

rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate sometimes years in advance which technologies we must implement and take advantage of in order to make our products and services competitive in the market therefore we usually start our product development with a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve we may not be able to achieve these goals or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly and effectively than we can in either case our products and services may be technologically inferior to our competitors’ less appealing to consumers or both if we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule of our products and services then we may delay their release until these technology goals can be achieved which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses alternatively we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies either to preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up with our competition which would increase our development expenses 

 

the video game hardware manufacturers set the royalty rates and other fees that we must pay to publish games for their platforms and therefore have significant influence on our costs if one or more of these manufacturers change their fee structure our profitability will be materially impacted 

 

in order to publish products for a video game system such as the xbox 360 playstation 3 or wii we must take a license from the manufacturer which gives it the opportunity to set the fee structure that we must pay in order to publish games for that platform similarly certain manufacturers have retained the flexibility to change their fee structures or adopt different fee structures for online gameplay and other new features for their consoles the control that hardware manufacturers have over the fee structures for their platforms and 

online access could adversely impact our costs profitability and margins because publishing products for video game systems is the largest portion of our business any increase in fee structures would significantly harm our ability to generate revenues andor profits 

 

the video game hardware manufacturers are among our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of andor access to our video game products if they do not approve our products we will be unable to ship to our customers 

 

our agreements with hardware licensors such as sony for the playstation 3 microsoft for the xbox 360 and nintendo for the wii typically give significant control to the licensor over the approval and manufacturing of our products which could in certain circumstances leave us unable to get our products approved manufactured and shipped to customers these hardware licensors are also among our chief competitors generally control of the approval and manufacturing process by the hardware licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently while we believe that our relationships with our hardware licensors are currently good the potential for these licensors to delay or refuse to approve or manufacture our products exists such occurrences would harm our business and our financial performance 

 

we also require compatibility code and the consent of microsoft sony and nintendo in order to include online capabilities in our products for their respective platforms as online capabilities for video game systems become more significant microsoft sony and nintendo could restrict the manner in which we provide online capabilities for our products if microsoft sony or nintendo refused to approve our products with online capabilities or significantly impacted the financial terms on which these services are offered to our customers our business could be harmed 

 

if we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to intellectual property we will publish fewer hit titles and our revenue profitability and cash flows will decline competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and reduce our profitability 

 

many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our ea sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players’ associations similarly many of our other hit franchises such as the godfather harry potter and lord of the rings are based on key film and literary licenses competition for these licenses is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses or obtain additional licenses with significant commercial value our revenues and profitability will decline significantly competition for these licenses may also drive up the advances guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor which could significantly increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

 

our business is subject to risks generally associated with the entertainment industry any of which could significantly harm our operating results 

 

our business is subject to risks that are generally associated with the entertainment industry many of which are beyond our control these risks could negatively impact our operating results and include the popularity price and timing of our games and the platforms on which they are played economic conditions that adversely affect discretionary consumer spending changes in consumer demographics the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted 

 

if we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel we will be unable to effectively conduct our business 

 

the market for technical creative marketing and other personnel essential to the development and marketing of our products and management of our businesses is extremely competitive our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of executives and key creative talent if we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need or replace key employees following their departure our ability to develop and manage our business will be impaired 

acquisitions investments and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties dilution to our investors and other negative consequences 

 

we have engaged in evaluated and expect to continue to engage in and evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions including i acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets ii minority investments in strategic partners and iii investments in new interactive entertainment businesses for example online and mobile games any of these strategic transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations although we regularly search for opportunities to engage in strategic transactions we may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities we may not be able to consummate potential acquisitions or investments or an acquisition or investment we do consummate may not enhance our business or may decrease rather than increase our earnings the process of acquiring and integrating a company or business or successfully exploiting acquired intellectual property or other assets could divert a significant amount of resources as well as our management’s time and focus and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures particularly for a large acquisition additional risks and variations of the foregoing risks we face include 

 

  

future acquisitions and investments could also involve the issuance of our equity and equitylinked securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization 

expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses such as stockbased compensation any of the foregoing factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating performance that could have otherwise been achieved by us on a standalone basis our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

 

if patent claims continue to be asserted against us we may be unable to sustain our current business models or profits or we may be precluded from pursuing new business opportunities in the future 

 

many patents have been issued that may apply to widelyused game technologies or to potential new modes of delivering playing or monetizing game software products for example infringement claims under many issued patents are now being asserted against interactive software or online game sites several such claims have been asserted against us we incur substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims regardless of the merits of the claims in the event that there is a determination that we have infringed a thirdparty patent we could incur significant monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future which could negatively impact our operating results we may also discover that future opportunities to provide new and innovative modes of game play and game delivery to consumers may be precluded by existing patents that we are unable to license on reasonable terms 

 

other intellectual property claims may increase our product costs or require us to cease selling affected products 

 

many of our products include extremely realistic graphical images and we expect that as technology continues to advance images will become even more realistic some of the images and other content are based on realworld examples that may inadvertently infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement from time to time we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims existing or future infringement claims against us whether valid or not may be time consuming and expensive to defend such claims or litigations could require us to stop selling the affected products redesign those products to avoid infringement or obtain a license all of which would be costly and harm our business 

 

from time to time we may become involved in other legal proceedings which could adversely affect us 

 

we are currently and from time to time in the future may become subject to legal proceedings claims litigation and government investigations or inquiries which could be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations in addition the outcome of any legal proceedings claims litigation investigations or inquiries may be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

 

our business our products and our distribution are subject to increasing regulation of content consumer privacy distribution and online hosting and delivery in the key territories in which we conduct business if we do not successfully respond to these regulations our business may suffer 

 

legislation is continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution for example data and consumer protection laws in the united states and europe impose various restrictions on our web sites those rules vary by territory although the internet recognizes no geographical boundaries other countries such as germany have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged games and those transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current united states laws in the united states the federal and several state governments are continually considering content restrictions on products such as ours as well as restrictions on distribution of such products for example recent legislation has been adopted in several states and could be proposed at the federal level that prohibits the sale of certain games  eg  violent games or those with “m mature” or “ao adults only” ratings to minors any one or more of these factors could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers by limiting the size of the potential market for our products and by requiring costly additional differentiation between products for different territories to address varying regulations 

if one or more of our titles were found to contain hidden objectionable content our business could suffer 

 

throughout the history of our industry many video games have been designed to include certain hidden content and gameplay features that are accessible through the use of ingame cheat codes or other technological means that are intended to enhance the gameplay experience however in several recent cases hidden content or features have been found to be included in other publishers’ products by an employee who was not authorized to do so or by an outside developer without the knowledge of the publisher from time to time some hidden content and features have contained profanity graphic violence and sexually explicit or otherwise objectionable material in a few cases the entertainment software ratings board “esrb” has reacted to discoveries of hidden content and features by reviewing the rating that was originally assigned to the product requiring the publisher to change the game packaging andor fining the publisher retailers have on occasion reacted to the discovery of such hidden content by removing these games from their shelves refusing to sell them and demanding that their publishers accept them as product returns likewise consumers have reacted to the revelation of hidden content by refusing to purchase such games demanding refunds for games they’ve already purchased and refraining from buying other games published by the company whose game contained the objectionable material 

 

we have implemented preventative measures designed to reduce the possibility of hidden objectionable content from appearing in the video games we publish nonetheless these preventative measures are subject to human error circumvention overriding and reasonable resource constraints in addition to the extent we acquire a company without similar controls in place the possibility of hidden objectionable content appearing in video games developed by that company but for which we are ultimately responsible could increase if a video game we published were found to contain hidden objectionable content the esrb could demand that we recall a game and change its packaging to reflect a revised rating retailers could refuse to sell it and demand we accept the return of any unsold copies or returns from customers and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand that we refund their money this could have a material negative impact on our operating results and financial condition in addition our reputation could be harmed which could impact sales of other video games we sell if any of these consequences were to occur our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed 

 

if we ship defective products our operating results could suffer 

 

products such as ours are extremely complex software programs and are difficult to develop manufacture and distribute we have quality controls in place to detect defects in the software media and packaging of our products before they are released nonetheless these quality controls are subject to human error overriding and reasonable resource constraints therefore these quality controls and preventative measures may not be effective in detecting defects in our products before they have been reproduced and released into the marketplace in such an event we could be required to recall a product or we may find it necessary to voluntarily recall a product andor scrap defective inventory which could significantly harm our business and operating results 

 

our international net revenue is subject to currency fluctuations 

 

for the fiscal year ended march 31 2008 international net revenue comprised 47 percent of our total net revenue we expect foreign sales to continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue such sales may be subject to unexpected regulatory requirements tariffs and other barriers additionally foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies which may fluctuate against the us dollar we use foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate some foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities primarily certain intercompany receivables and payables and from time to time foreign currency option contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions primarily related to a portion of the revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currency generated by our operational subsidiaries however these activities do not fully protect us from foreign currency fluctuations and can themselves result in losses accordingly our results of operations including our reported net revenue and net income and financial condition can be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations particularly the euro british pound sterling and canadian dollar 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 

 

we are also required to estimate what our tax obligations will be in the future although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the estimation process and applicable laws are inherently uncertain and our estimates are not binding on tax authorities our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by our profit level by changes in our business or changes in our structure resulting from the reorganization of our business and operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the elections we make changes in applicable tax laws as well as other factors further our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should our ultimate tax liability exceed our estimates our income tax provision and net income or loss could be materially affected 

 

we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our consolidated pretax income or loss as a result in absolute dollar terms our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pretax income or loss than higher levels in addition at lower levels of pretax income or loss our effective tax rate will be more volatile 

 

we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under examination by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations changes in our business or changes in applicable tax rules will not have an adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition 

 

changes in our worldwide operating structure or the adoption of new products and distribution models could have adverse tax consequences 

 

as we expand our international operations adopt new products and new distribution models implement changes to our operating structure or undertake intercompany transactions in light of changing tax laws expiring rulings acquisitions and our current and anticipated business and operational requirements our tax expense could increase for example in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we repatriated 375 million under the american jobs creation act of 2004 as a result we recognized an additional onetime tax expense in fiscal 2006 of 17 million 

 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves 

 

as a result of the enactment of the sarbanesoxley act and the review of accounting policies by the sec and national and international accounting standards bodies the frequency of accounting policy changes may accelerate for example as discussed in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements fin no 48 has affected the way we account for income taxes and may have a material impact on our financial results our adoption of statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 141r will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for material acquisitions consummated after march 29 2009 similarly changes in accounting standards relating to stockbased compensation require us to recognize significantly greater expense than we had been recognizing prior to the adoption of the new standard likewise policies affecting software revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products and services for example we expect a more significant portion of our games will be onlineenabled in the future and we could be required to recognize the related revenue over an extended period of time rather than at the time of sale as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue and taxes could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

the majority of our sales are made to a relatively small number of key customers if these customers reduce their purchases of our products or become unable to pay for them our business could be harmed 

 

in our fiscal year ended march 31 2008 over 73 percent of our us sales were made to seven key customers in europe our top ten customers accounted for approximately 32 percent of our sales in that territory during the year ended march 31 2008 worldwide we had direct sales to two customers gamestop corp and walmart stores which represented approximately 13 percent and 12 percent respectively of total net revenue in the year ended march 31 2008 though our products are available to consumers through a variety of retailers the concentration of our sales in one or a few large customers could lead to a shortterm disruption in our sales if one or more of these customers significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to carry our products and could make us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers became unable to pay for our products additionally our receivables from these large customers increase significantly in the december quarter as they stock up for the holiday selling season also having such a large portion of our total net revenue concentrated in a few customers could reduce our negotiating leverage with these customers 

 

our products are subject to the threat of piracy and unauthorized copying which could negatively impact our growth and future profitability 

 

software piracy is a persistent problem particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights the global expansion of organized pirate operations the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures we use in our products the availability of broadband access to the internet and the ability to download pirated copies of our games from various internet sites and through peertopeer channels and the widespread proliferation of internet cafes using pirated copies of our products all have contributed to ongoing and expanding piracy though we take legal and technical steps to make the unauthorized copying and distribution of our products more difficult as do the manufacturers of consoles on which our games are played these efforts may not be successful in controlling the piracy of our products these factors could have a negative effect on our growth and profitability in the future 

 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors above as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts’ earnings estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts’ and investors’ expectations to factors affecting the entertainment computer software internet media or electronics industries to our ability to successfully integrate any acquisitions we may make or to national or international economic conditions

the following diagram depicts the locations of our most significant facilities throughout the world 

 

 

we currently own a 418000squarefoot product development studio facility in burnaby british columbia canada we also own a 122000squarefoot administrative sales and development facility in chertsey england which we no longer occupy in addition to the properties we own we lease approximately 31 million square feet of facilities including significant leases for our headquarters in redwood city california our studios in los angeles california and orlando florida and our distribution center in louisville kentucky our leased space is summarized as follows in square feet 

 

 

 

redwood city headquarters 

 

in february 1995 we entered into a buildtosuit lease “phase one lease” with a thirdparty lessor for our headquarters facilities in redwood city california “phase one facilities” the phase one facilities comprise a total of approximately 350000 square feet and provide space for sales marketing administration and research and development functions in july 2001 the lessor refinanced the phase one lease with keybank national association through july 2006 the phase one lease expires in january 2039 subject to early termination in the event the underlying financing between the lessor and its lenders is not extended subject to certain terms and conditions we may purchase the phase one facilities or arrange for the sale of the phase one facilities to a third party 

 

pursuant to the terms of the phase one lease we have an option to purchase the phase one facilities at any time for a purchase price of 132 million in the event of a sale to a third party if the sale price is less than 132 million we will be obligated to reimburse the difference between the actual sale price and 132 million up to a maximum of 117 million subject to certain provisions of the phase one lease as amended 

 

on may 26 2006 the lessor extended its loan financing underlying the phase one lease with its lenders through july 2007 and on may 14 2007 the lenders extended this financing again for an additional year through july 2008 on april 14 2008 the lenders extended the financing for another year through july 2009 

at any time prior to the expiration of the financing in july 2009 we may renegotiate the lease and the related financing arrangement we account for the phase one lease arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with sfas no 13 “ accounting for leases ” as amended 

 

in december 2000 we entered into a second buildtosuit lease “phase two lease” with keybank national association for a five and onehalf year term beginning in december 2000 to expand our redwood city california headquarters facilities and develop adjacent property “phase two facilities” construction of the phase two facilities was completed in june 2002 the phase two facilities comprise a total of approximately 310000 square feet and provide space for sales marketing administration and research and development functions subject to certain terms and conditions we may purchase the phase two facilities or arrange for the sale of the phase two facilities to a third party 

 

pursuant to the terms of the phase two lease we have an option to purchase the phase two facilities at any time for a purchase price of 115 million in the event of a sale to a third party if the sale price is less than 115 million we will be obligated to reimburse the difference between the actual sale price and 115 million up to a maximum of 105 million subject to certain provisions of the phase two lease as amended 

 

on may 26 2006 the lessor extended the phase two lease through july 2009 subject to early termination in the event the underlying loan financing between the lessor and its lenders is not extended concurrently with the extension of the lease the lessor extended the loan financing underlying the phase two lease with its lenders through july 2007 on may 14 2007 the lenders extended this financing again for an additional year through july 2008 on april 14 2008 the lenders extended the financing for another year through july 2009 at any time prior to the expiration of the financing in july 2009 we may renegotiate the lease and the related financing arrangement we account for the phase two lease arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with sfas no 13 as amended 

 

we believe that as of march 31 2008 the estimated fair values of both properties under these operating leases exceeded their respective guaranteed residual values 

 

guildford orlando los angeles and vancouver studios louisville distribution center 

 

in february 2006 we entered into an agreement with an independent third party to lease a facility in guildford surrey united kingdom which commenced in june 2006 and will expire in may 2016 the facility comprises a total of approximately 95000 square feet which we use for administrative sales and development functions our rental obligation under this agreement is approximately 33 million over the initial tenyear term of the lease

special note regarding deferred net revenue 

 

the ubiquity of highspeed internet access and the integration of network connectivity into new generation game consoles are expected to continue to increase demand for games with onlineenabled features to address this demand many of our software products are developed with the ability to be connected to and played via the internet in order for consumers to participate in online communities and play against one another via the internet we either directly or through outsourced arrangements with third parties maintain servers which support an online service we offer to consumers for activities such as matchmaking in situations where we do not separately sell this online service we account for the sale of the software product as a “bundle” sale or multiple element arrangement in which we sell both the software product and the online service for one combined price 

 

through fiscal 2007 for accounting purposes vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” existed for the online service accordingly we allocated the revenue collected from the sale of the software product between the online service offered and the software product and recognized the amounts allocated to each element separately however starting in fiscal 2008 for accounting purposes the required vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value did not exist for the online service related to certain of our onlineenabled software products this prevented us from allocating and separately recognizing revenue related to the software product and the online service accordingly starting in fiscal 2008 we began to recognize all of the revenue from the sale of our onlineenabled software products for the pc playstation 2 playstation 3 wii and the psp on a deferred basis over an estimated online service period which we estimate to be six months beginning in the month after shipment on a quarterly basis the deferral amount will vary significantly depending upon the number of titles we release the timing of their release sales volume returns and price protection provided for these onlineenabled software products in addition we expense the cost of goods sold related to these transactions during the period in which the product is delivered rather than on a deferred basis which inherently creates volatility in our reported gross margin percentages 

as of march 31 2008 we had an accumulated balance of 387 million of deferred net revenue related to onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content substantially all of which was driven by sales made during the six months ended march 31 2008 as of march 31 2007 we had an accumulated balance of 32 million of deferred net revenue related to onlineenabled packaged goods and digital content 

 

financial results 

 

total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2008 was 3665 billion up 19 percent as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2007 the impact of deferrals related to packaged goods and digital content for the fiscal year ended march 31 2008 decreased our reported net revenue and operating income by 355 million net revenue was driven by sales of rock band madden nfl 08  fifa 08  need for speed prostreet and the simpsons tm game 

 

net loss for the fiscal year ended march 31 2008 was 454 million as compared to net income of 76 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2007 diluted loss per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2008 was 145 as compared to diluted income per share of 024 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2007 net income decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to 1 an increase in cost of goods sold of 593 million 2 an increase in sales of onlineenabled titles for which we were unable to establish vsoe that resulted in the net deferral of 355 million of net revenue out of fiscal 2008 and into future periods 3 an increase of 135 million in acquired inprocess technology primarily due to our acquisition of vg holding corp 4 losses on strategic investments of 118 million 5 an increase of 108 million in personnelrelated costs 6 an increase of 90 million in marketing advertising and promotional expenses primarily to support our launch of new franchises and incremental spending on recurring franchises and 7 an increase of 88 million in restructuring charges primarily as a result of our fiscal 2008 reorganization these items were partially offset by 1 an increase in 574 million in net revenue and 2 119 million lower income tax expense 

 

we generated 338 million of cash from operating activities during the year ended march 31 2008 as compared to 397 million for fiscal 2007 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to 1 an increase in operating expenses paid resulting from an increase in advertising and marketing costs external development expenses and personnelrelated expenses and 2 a 90 million increase in incentivebased cash compensation paid in fiscal 2008 which were earned with respect to fiscal 2007 performance these decreases were significantly offset by higher net revenue collected during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 

 

management’s overview of historical and prospective business trends 

 

fiscal 2008 reorganization in fiscal 2008 we reorganized our business into four operating “labels” — ea games ea sports the sims and ea casual entertainment — and an additional group that works closely with the labels — global publishing each label is structured to operate globally and includes several key functions including development studios product marketing and planning for products and services global publishing operates in three regions north america europe and asia and is responsible for strategic planning field marketing sales distribution operations product certification quality assurance motion capture art outsourcing and localization 

 

in october 2007 our board of directors approved a plan of reorganization “fiscal 2008 reorganization plan” since the inception of the fiscal 2008 reorganization plan through march 31 2008 we incurred charges associated with 1 the closure of our chertsey england and chicago illinois facilities which included asset impairment and lease termination costs 2 employeerelated expenses and 3 other costs including other contract terminations as well as it and consulting costs to assist in the reorganization of our business support functions during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we completed the closure of our chertsey facility and consolidated our local operations and employees into our guildford england facility over the next 18 months we expect to continue to incur it and consulting costs to assist in the reorganization of our business support functions 

including charges incurred through march 31 2008 we expect to incur cash and noncash charges between 115 million and 125 million by fiscal 2010 related to our fiscal 2008 reorganization plan these charges will consist primarily of employeerelated costs approximately 10 million in cash charges facility exit costs approximately 60 million in cash and noncash charges as well as other reorganization costs including other contract terminations and it and consulting costs to assist in the reorganization of our business support functions approximately 50 million in cash and noncash charges 

 

transition to a new generation of consoles video game hardware systems have historically had a life cycle of four to six years which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well the current cycle began with microsoft’s launch of the xbox 360 in 2005 and continued in 2006 when sony and nintendo launched their nextgeneration systems the playstation 3 and the wii respectively during fiscal 2008 the installed base of each of these systems continued to expand and as a result sales of our products for these systems have also increased significantly at the same time however demand for video games for priorgeneration systems particularly the original xbox and the nintendo gamecube has declined significantly although we expect to continue developing and marketing new titles for the priorgeneration playstation 2 in fiscal 2009 we only expect to release one title for the original xbox and no titles for the nintendo gamecube as a result we expect our sales of video games for priorgeneration systems will continue to decline the decline in priorgeneration product sales particularly the playstation 2 may be greater or faster than we anticipate and sales of products for the new platforms may be lower or increase more slowly than we anticipate moreover we expect development costs for the new video game systems continue to be greater on a pertitle basis than development costs for priorgeneration video game systems 

 

we have incurred increased costs during this transition as we have continued to develop and market new titles for certain priorgeneration video game platforms while also making significant investments in products for the new generation platforms we expect research and development expenses to increase on an absolute basis in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 although not necessarily as a percentage of net revenue 

 

online today we generate net revenue from a variety of online products and services including casual games and downloadable content marketed under our pogo brand persistent state world games such as ultima online tm and dark age of camelot ®  pcbased downloadable content and onlineenabled packaged goods in addition we are anticipating the release of a new massively multiplayer online roleplaying game warhammer ® online  we intend to make significant investments in online products infrastructure and services and believe that online gameplay will become an increasingly important part of our business in the long term 

 

expansion of mobile platforms advances in mobile technology have resulted in a variety of new and evolving platforms for onthego interactive entertainment that appeal to a broader demographic of consumers our efforts to capitalize on the growth in mobile interactive entertainment are focused in two broad areas — packaged goods games for handheld game systems and downloadable games for cellular handsets 

 

we have developed and published games for a variety of handheld platforms for several years more recently the sony psp and the nintendo ds with their enhanced graphics deeper gameplay and online functionality provide a richer mobile gaming experience for consumers 

 

we expect sales of games for handhelds and cellular handsets to continue to be an important part of our business worldwide 

 

acquisitions and investments we have engaged in evaluated and expect to continue to engage in and evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions including acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets since the beginning of fiscal 2007 we have announced andor completed several acquisitions and investments including 

 

 31 

 

  

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we announced a proposal to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of taketwo interactive software inc“taketwo” for a total purchase price of approximately 21 billion including fees and expenses taketwo’s board of directors has stated that our offer undervalues the company and is not in the best interests of stockholders if we were to acquire taketwo we expect the acquisition would have a material impact on our future financial position and results of operations and cash flows although the offer is not conditional upon any financing arrangements our board of directors has authorized us to obtain additional financing a portion of which may be used in part to fund the acquisition there can be no assurance that we will acquire taketwo 

 

international operations and foreign currency exchange impact international sales are a fundamental part of our business net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately 47 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal 2008 and approximately 46 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal 2007 our international net revenue was primarily driven by sales in europe and to a much lesser extent in asia yearoveryear we estimate that foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on our net revenue of 125 million or 4 percent for the year ended march 31 2008 we believe that in order to succeed internationally it is important to locally develop content that is specifically directed toward local cultures and consumers 

 

stockbased compensation beginning on april 1 2006 we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 123 revised 2004 “sfas no 123r” “ sharebased payment ” and applied the provisions of staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 107 “ sharebased payment ” to our adoption of sfas no 123r during fiscal 2008 we recognized stockbased compensation of 150 million pretax and 123 million net of tax during fiscal 2007 we recognized stockbased compensation of 133 million pretax and 107 million net of tax stockbased compensation expense has been reflected in the respective functional line items on our consolidated statements of operations 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities contingent assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown as a result actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

 

revenue recognition sales returns allowances and bad debt reserves 

 

we derive revenue principally from sales of interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation 2 playstation 3 xbox 360 and wii pcs and mobile platforms including handheld game players such as the psp and nintendo ds and cellular handsets we evaluate the 

recognition of revenue based on the criteria set forth in statement of position “sop” 972 “software revenue recognition”  as amended by sop 989 “modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” and sab no 104 “revenue recognition”  we evaluate and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met 

 

  

determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report in each period for example for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to 1 determine whether and when each element has been delivered 2 determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services 3 determine whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element and 4 allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver changes to any of these assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period for example in connection with some of our packaged goods product sales we offer an online service without an additional fee prior to fiscal 2008 we were able to determine vsoe for the online service to be delivered therefore we were able to allocate the total price received from the combined product and online service sale between these two elements and recognize the related revenue separately however starting in fiscal 2008 vsoe does not exist for the online service to be delivered for certain platforms and all revenue from these transactions are recognized over the estimated online service period more specifically starting in fiscal 2008 we began to recognize the revenue from sales of certain onlineenabled packaged goods on a straightline basis over a six month period beginning in the month after shipment accordingly this relatively small change from having vsoe for the online service to no longer having vsoe has had a significant effect on our reported results 

 

determining whether a transaction constitutes an online game service transaction or a download of a product requires judgment and can be difficult the accounting for these transactions is significantly different revenue from product downloads is generally recognized when the download occurs assuming all other recognition criteria are met revenue from online game services is recognized as the services are rendered if the service period is not defined we recognize the revenue over the estimated service period determining the estimated service period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage 

 

product revenue including sales to resellers and distributors “channel partners” is recognized when the above criteria are met we reduce product revenue for estimated future returns price protection and other offerings which may occur with our customers and channel partners price protection represents the right to receive a credit allowance in the event we lower our wholesale price on a particular product the amount of the price protection is generally the difference between the old price and the new price in certain countries we have stockbalancing programs for our pc and video game system products which allow for the exchange of these products by resellers under certain circumstances it is our general practice to exchange products or give credits rather than to give cash refunds 

in certain countries from time to time we decide to provide price protection for both our pc and video game system products when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances we analyze historical returns current sellthrough of distributor and retailer inventory of our products current trends in retail and the video game segment changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors in addition we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods 

 

in the future actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms product updates or competing products for example the risk of product returns andor price protection for our products may continue to increase as the playstation 2 console moves through its lifecycle while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters these estimates are inherently subjective accordingly if our estimates changed our returns and price protection reserves would change which would impact the total net revenue we report for example if actual returns andor price protection were significantly greater than the reserves we have established our actual results would decrease our reported total net revenue conversely if actual returns andor price protection were significantly less than our reserves this would increase our reported total net revenue in addition if our estimates of returns and price protection related to onlineenabled packaged goods products change the amount of net deferred revenue we recognize in the future would change 

 

significant judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends and historical experience depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly 

 

fair value estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item in order to fairly present our financial statements without an independent market or another representative transaction determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion on the appropriate accounting 

 

there are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value these include 1 the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value 2 the income approach which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example future cash flows or future earnings to a single present amount and 3 the cost approach which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset for many of our fair value estimates including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets acquired inprocess technology and equity instruments granted for services we use the income approach using the income approach requires the use of financial models which require us to make various estimates including but not limited to 1 the potential future cash flows for the asset liability or equity instrument being measured 2 the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows 3 the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows and 4 the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium making these cash flow estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate our financial results may be negatively impacted furthermore relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact to the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached for example a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired 

while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments 

 

business combinations we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and acquired inprocess technology in a business combination our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material affect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives and acquired inprocess technology is expensed upon consummation furthermore a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount to recognize as goodwill an asset that is not amortized often determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of expected use of the asset the expected cost to extinguish the liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired inprocess technology such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our financial statements 

 

assessment of impairment of assets current accounting standards require that we assess the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets is potentially impaired in order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred management must make various assumptions about the estimated fair value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash flows for some assets our estimated fair value is dependent upon our predictions of which of our products we develop will be successful which is dependent upon several things beyond our control such as which operating platforms will be successful in the marketplace also our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules 

 

sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” requires at least an annual assessment for impairment of goodwill by applying a fairvaluebased test application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit determining the estimated fair value for each reporting unit could be materially affected by changes in estimates and assumptions which could trigger impairment 

 

stockbased compensation we are required to estimate the fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant the estimated fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights granted pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan is determined using the blackscholes valuation model which requires us to make certain assumptions about the future determining the estimated fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding subjective and complex variables such as expected employee exercise behavior and our expected stock price volatility over the term of the award we estimated the following key assumptions for the blackscholes valuation calculation 

 

  

changes to our underlying stock price our assumptions used in the blackscholes option valuation calculation and our forfeiture rate which is based on historical data as well as future equity granted or assumed through acquisitions could significantly impact compensation expense to be recognized in future periods 

royalties and licenses 

 

our royalty expenses consist of payments to 1 content licensors 2 independent software developers and 3 copublishing and distribution affiliates license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities professional sports organizations movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks copyrights personal publicity rights content andor other intellectual property royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games copublishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of product 

 

royaltybased obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid these royaltybased obligations are generally expensed to cost of goods sold generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on the total projected net revenue significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors including 1 the total number of titles subject to the contract 2 the timing of the release of these titles 3 the number of software units we expect to sell which can be impacted by a number of variables including product quality and competition and 4 future pricing determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products accordingly if our future revenue projections change our effective royalty rates would change which could impact the royalty expense we recognize prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and copublishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product and therefore we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product accordingly payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred payments due after completion of the product primarily royaltybased in nature are generally expensed as cost of goods sold 

 

our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor when performance remains with the licensor we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract minimum royalty payment obligations are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next twelve months as of march 31 2008 and 2007 approximately 10 million and 9 million respectively of minimum guaranteed royalty obligations had been recognized 

 

each quarter we also evaluate the future realization of our royaltybased assets as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales any impairments or losses determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense impairments or losses determined postlaunch are charged to cost of goods sold in either case we rely on estimated revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties and commitments if actual sales or revised revenue estimates fall below the initial revenue estimate then the actual charge taken may be greater in any given quarter than anticipated during fiscal 2008 and 2006 we recognized impairment charges of 4 million and 16 million respectively we had no impairments during fiscal 2007 

 

income taxes 

 

we adopted financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation “fin” no 48 “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 ” in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate these 

estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities the ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations we are also required to make determinations of the need to record deferred tax liabilities and the recoverability of deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is established to the extent that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction 

 

in addition changes in our business including acquisitions changes in our international corporate structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix and amount of income as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities valuation allowances applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate 

 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves accounting for uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules regulations and practices as a result of the implementation of fin no 48 we recognize benefits for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition of a benefit or the absence of a liability by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position taken will be sustained upon audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any if it is not in our judgment “more likely than not” that the position will be sustained then we do not recognize any benefit for the position if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained a second step in the process is required to estimate how much of the benefit we will ultimately receive this second step requires that we estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on a number of factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law new facts correspondence with tax authorities during the course of an audit effective settlement of audit issues and commencement of new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period as a result of the adoption of fin no 48 we expect our tax rate to be more volatile 

 

we historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly no us taxes have been provided thereon although we repatriated funds under the american jobs creation act of 2004 in fiscal 2006 we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states

impact of recently issued accounting standards 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements”  sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts sfas no 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy in february 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” financial accounting standard “fas” 1571 “application of fasb statement no 157 to fasb statement no 13 and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under statement 13” and fsp fas 1572 “effective date of fasb statement no 157”  these fsps 1 defer the effective date in sfas no 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 2 exclude certain leasing transactions accounted for under sfas no 13 “accounting for leases”  from the scope of statement 157 and 3 include several specific examples of items eligible or not eligible for the oneyear deferral the provisions of sfas no 157 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years fsp fas 1571 is effective upon the initial adoption of sfas no 157 fsp fas 1572 defers the effective date of certain provisions of sfas no 157 to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of the fsp we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 157 fsp fas 1571 and fsp fas 1572 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 

 

 

changes in cash flow 

 

during fiscal 2008 we generated 338 million of cash from operating activities as compared to 397 million for fiscal 2007 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to 1 an increase in operating expenses paid resulting from an increase in advertising and marketing costs external development expenses and personnelrelated expenses and 2 a 90 million increase in incentivebased cash compensation paid in fiscal 2008 which were earned with respect to fiscal 2007 performance these decreases were significantly offset by higher net revenue collected during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 

 

for fiscal 2008 we generated 2306 million of cash proceeds from maturities and sales of shortterm investments and 192 million in proceeds from sales of common stock through our stockbased compensation plans our primary use of cash in nonoperating activities consisted of 1 1739 million used to purchase shortterm investments 2 607 million for the acquisition of vgh and 3 277 million used to purchase marketable equitable securities and other investments 

 

shortterm investments and marketable equity securities 

 

due to our mix of fixed and variable rate securities our shortterm investment portfolio is susceptible to changes in shortterm interest rates as of march 31 2008 our shortterm investments had gross unrealized gains of 9 million or 1 percent of the total in shortterm investments and gross unrealized losses of less than 1 million or less than 1 percent of the total in shortterm investments from time to time we may liquidate some or all of our shortterm investments to fund operational needs or other activities such as capital expenditures business acquisitions or stock repurchase programs depending on which shortterm investments we liquidate to fund these activities we could recognize a portion or all of the gross unrealized gains or losses 

 

marketable equity securities increased to 729 million as of march 31 2008 from 341 million as of march 31 2007 primarily due to 1 an increase of 251 million in the fair value of our investment in ubisoft entertainment 2 our 167 million investment in the9 and 3 our 83 million common stock investment in neowiz these increases were partially offset by 1 an 81 million impairment recognized on the9 investment and 2 a 28 million impairment recognized on the neowiz common stock investment in addition to the neowiz common stock investment noted above we made a 27 million preferred stock investment in neowiz which is classified in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet we recognized a 9 million impairment on our neowiz preferred stock investment 

 

receivables net 

 

our gross accounts receivable balances were 544 million and 470 million as of march 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in our accounts receivable balance was primarily due to higher sales volumes during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 reserves for sales returns pricing allowances and doubtful accounts increased in absolute dollars from 214 million as of march 31 2007 to 238 million as of march 31 2008 as a percentage of trailing nine month net revenue reserves decreased from 8 percent as of march 31 2007 to 7 percent as of march 31 2008 we believe these reserves are adequate based on historical experience and our current estimate of potential returns pricing allowances and doubtful accounts 

 

inventories 

 

inventories increased to 168 million as of march 31 2008 from 62 million as of march 31 2007 primarily as a result of 1 64 million in rock band inventory of which approximately 43 million was intransit as of march 31 2008 and 2 the overall growth of our business 

other current assets 

 

other current assets increased to 290 million as of march 31 2008 from 219 million as of march 31 2007 primarily due to the reclassification as an asset held for sale of our facility in chertsey england from property and equipment net to other current assets 

 

other assets 

 

other assets increased to 157 million as of march 31 2008 from 96 million as of march 31 2007 primarily due to 1 19 million higher prepaid royalties 2 higher other investments of 15 million substantially resulting from our purchase of neowiz preferred stock and 3 13 million of prepaid taxes reclassified from current assets 

 

accounts payable 

 

accounts payable increased to 229 million as of march 31 2008 from 180 million as of march 31 2007 primarily due to higher inventory purchases related to rock band  

 

accrued and other current liabilities 

 

our accrued and other liabilities decreased to 683 million as of march 31 2008 from 814 million as of march 31 2007 the decrease was primarily due to 1 273 million of current income taxes accrued being reclassified to noncurrent tax obligations as a result of our adoption of fin no 48 see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and 2 a decrease of 32 million in accrued incentivebased compensation these decreases were partially offset by an increase of 106 million in royalties payable primarily due to rock band  

 

deferred income taxes net 

 

our net deferred income tax asset position increased by 197 million as of march 31 2008 as compared to march 31 2007 primarily due to increases of 1 76 million in deferred taxes related to current year tax provision 2 53 million in deferred taxes related to our acquisition of vgh 3 43 million in deferred tax assets related to our adoption of fin no 48 and current year activities and 4 25 million in deferred tax assets related to stockbased compensation 

 

financial condition 

 

we believe that cash cash equivalents shortterm investments marketable equity securities cash generated from operations and available financing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months including working capital requirements capital expenditures and potentially future acquisitions or strategic investments we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position facilitate expansion pursue strategic acquisitions and investments or to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise there can be no assurance however that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms if at all or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 

 

on march 13 2008 we commenced an unsolicited 2600 per share cash tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of taketwo interactive software inc a delaware corporation “taketwo” for a total purchase price of approximately 21 billion on april 18 2008 we adjusted the purchase price in the cash tender offer to 2574 per share following the approval by taketwo stockholders of amendments to taketwo’s incentive stock plan which would permit the issuance of additional shares of restricted stock to zelnickmedia corporation pursuant to its management agreement with taketwo the total aggregate purchase price for taketwo did not change as a result of the adjustment to the per share purchase price in the tender offer on may 9 2008 we received a commitment from certain financial institutions to provide us with up to 10 billion of senior unsecured term loan financing at any time until january 9 2009 to be used to provide a portion of the funds for the offer andor merger we will be required to repay any funds we borrow under the term loan 

facility plus accrued interest on the earlier of a 364 days from the date on which we initially borrow the funds and b august 9 2009 on may 19 2008 we extended the expiration date of the tender offer until june 16 2008 we intend to pay for the taketwo shares and related transaction fees and expenses with internally available cash and borrowings under the term loan facility or other financing sources which may be available to us in the future 

 

the loan financing arrangements supporting our redwood city headquarters leases with keybank national association described in the “offbalance sheet commitments” section below are scheduled to expire in july 2009 at any time prior to the expiration of the financing in july 2009 we may renegotiate the lease and the related financing arrangement upon expiration of the leases we may purchase the facilities for 247 million or arrange for a sale of the facilities to a third party in the event of a sale to a third party if the sale price is less than 247 million we will be obligated to reimburse the difference between the actual sale price and 247 million up to maximum of 222 million subject to certain provisions of the leases 

 

as of march 31 2008 approximately 1357 million of our cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and marketable equity securities that was generated from operations was domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions while we have no plans to repatriate these funds to the united states in the short term if we choose to do so we would accrue and pay additional taxes on any portion of the repatriation where no united states income tax had been previously provided 

 

we have a “shelf” registration statement on form s3 on file with the sec this shelf registration statement which includes a base prospectus allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings up to a total amount of 2 billion unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus we would use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes including for working capital financing capital expenditures research and development marketing and distribution efforts and if opportunities arise for acquisitions or strategic alliances pending such uses we may invest the net proceeds in interestbearing securities in addition we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

development celebrity league and content licenses payments and commitments 

 

the products we produce in our studios are designed and created by our employee designers artists software programmers and by nonemployee software developers “independent artists” or “thirdparty developers” we typically advance development funds to the independent artists and thirdparty developers during development of our games usually in installment payments made upon the completion of specified development milestones contractually these payments are generally considered advances against subsequent royalties on the sales of the products these terms are set forth in written agreements entered into with the independent artists and thirdparty developers 

 

in addition we have certain celebrity league and content license contracts that contain minimum guarantee payments and marketing commitments that may not be dependent on any deliverables celebrities and organizations with whom we have contracts include fifa fifpro foundation uefa and fapl football association premier league limited professional soccer nascar stock car racing national basketball association professional basketball pga tour and tiger woods professional golf national hockey league and nhl players’ association professional hockey warner bros harry potter and batman new

the following table summarizes our minimum contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of march 31 2008 and the effect we expect them to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

the amounts represented in the table above reflect our minimal cash obligations for the respective fiscal years but do not necessarily represent the periods in which they will be expensed in our consolidated financial statements 

 

in addition to what is included in the table above as discussed in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we have adopted the provisions of fin no 48 as of march 31 2008 we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling 360 million of which approximately 41 million is offset by prior cash deposits to tax authorities for issues pending resolution for the remaining liability we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 

 

related person transaction 

 

prior to becoming chief executive officer of electronic arts john riccitiello was a founder and managing director of elevation partners lp and also served as chief executive officer of vgh which we acquired in 

january 2008 at the time of the acquisition mr riccitiello held an indirect financial interest in vgh resulting from his interest in the entity that controlled elevation partners lp and his interest in a limited partner of elevation partners lp elevation partners lp was a significant stockholder of vgh as a result of the acquisition mr riccitiello’s financial returns related to these interests including returns of deemed capital contributions have been 24 million to date some of which mr riccitiello could be required to return depending on the performance of the elevation entities and could be up to an additional 16 million plus any interest or other amounts earned thereon this amount could be reduced however by a variety of factors including investment losses of elevation if any as well as certain expenses of elevation that could offset partnership profits upon his separation from elevation partners lp mr riccitiello ceased to have any further control or influence over these factors 

 

from the commencement of negotiations with vgh at the direction of ea’s board of directors ea’s audit committee engaged directly with ea management independently from mr riccitiello to analyze and consider the potential benefits risks and material terms of the acquisition ea’s board of directors approved the acquisition after reviewing with ea’s management and members of the audit committee the terms of the acquisition and the potential benefits and risks thereof as well as mr riccitiello’s personal financial interest in vgh and the acquisition mr riccitiello recused himself from the board of directors meeting during the board’s deliberation of the acquisition and he did not vote on the acquisition

we believe that as of march 31 2008 the estimated fair values of both properties under these operating leases exceeded their respective guaranteed residual values

market risk 

 

we are exposed to various market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market prices market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks foreign exchange option and forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below we have not historically nor do we currently hedge our shortterm investment portfolio we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be exposed to significant interest rate risk because our cash and cash equivalent portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report we also do not currently hedge our market price risk relating to our equity investments further we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

cash flow hedging activities from time to time we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreigncurrencydenominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing option contracts that generally have maturities of 15 months or less these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges the derivative assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity and subsequently reclassified into net revenue or operating expenses as appropriate in the period when the forecasted transaction is recorded the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value if any is reported in each period in interest and other income net in our consolidated statements of operations our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements in revenue and operating expenses as of march 31 2008 we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately 48 million in foreign currencies and to sell approximately 254 million of foreign currencies as of march 31 2008 these foreign currency option contracts outstanding had a total fair value of 5 million included in other current assets as of march 31 2007 we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately 28 million in foreign currencies and to sell approximately 72 million of foreign currencies as of march 31 2007 these foreign currency option contracts outstanding had a total fair value of less than 1 million included in other current assets 

 

balance sheet hedging activities we use foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreigncurrencydenominated assets and liabilities primarily intercompany receivables and payables the forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three months or less and are transacted near monthend our foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 133 and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts are reported as other current assets or other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses 

from changes in fair value are reported in interest and other income net the gains and losses on these forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying foreigncurrencydenominated assets and liabilities which are also reported in interest and other income net in our consolidated statements of operations in certain cases the amount of such gains and losses will significantly differ from the amount of gains and losses recognized on the underlying foreign currency denominated asset or liability in which case our results will be impacted as of march 31 2008 we had forward foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell approximately 540 million in foreign currencies of this amount 479 million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars 13 million to sell foreign currencies in exchange for british pounds sterling and 48 million to purchase foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars as of march 31 2007 we had forward foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell approximately 104 million in foreign currencies of this amount 73 million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars 8 million to sell foreign currencies in exchange for british pounds sterling and 23 million to purchase foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars the fair value of our forward contracts was immaterial as of march 31 2008 and march 31 2007 

 

the counterparties to these forward and option contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks therefore the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not considered to be material 

 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations as of march 31 2008 a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would have resulted in a potential loss in fair value of our option contracts used in cash flow hedging of 4 million in both scenarios as of march 31 2007 a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement would have resulted in a potential loss in fair value of our option contracts used in cash flow hedging of 1 million in both scenarios a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would have resulted in potential losses on our forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of 56 million and 82 million respectively as of march 31 2008 and 9 million and 14 million respectively as of march 31 2007 this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift in foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar exchange rates do not always move in the same direction actual results may differ materially 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities however because shortterm securities mature relatively quickly and are required to be reinvested at the then current market rates interest income on a portfolio consisting of shortterm securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term securities additionally the contractual terms of the securities do not permit the issuer to call prepay or otherwise settle the securities at prices less than the stated par value of the securities our investments are held for purposes other than trading also we do not use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio 

 

as of march 31 2008 and 2007 our shortterm investments were classified as availableforsale and consequently recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of any tax effects in 

stockholders’ equity our portfolio of shortterm investments consisted of the following investment categories summarized by fair value as of march 31 2008 and 2007 in millions 

 

 

 

notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations at any time a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value in our shortterm investment portfolio as of march 31 2008 arising from potential changes in interest rates the modeling technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps 

 

 

 

the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value in our shortterm investment portfolio as of march 31 2007 arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 

 

 

 

market price risk 

 

the value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility and foreign currency risk for investments denominated in foreign currencies as of march 31 2008 and 2007 our marketable equity securities were classified as availableforsale and consequently were recorded in our 

consolidated balance sheets at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of any tax effects in stockholders’ equity the fair value of our marketable equity securities was 729 million and 341 million as of march 31 2008 and 2007 respectively in fiscal 2008 we recognized an otherthantemporary impairment loss of 109 million 

 

at any time a sharp change in market prices in our investments in marketable equity securities could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investments the following table presents hypothetical changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities as of march 31 2008 arising from changes in market prices plus or minus 25 percent 50 percent and 75 percent 

 

 

 

the following table presents hypothetical changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities as of march 31 2007 arising from changes in market prices plus or minus 25 percent 50 percent and 75 percent

our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the exchange act such as this report is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our management evaluates these controls and procedures on an ongoing basis 

 

there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures these limitations include the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures and reasonable resource constraints in addition because we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions which we believe are reasonable about the likelihood of future events our system of controls may not achieve its desired purpose under all possible future conditions accordingly our disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance but not absolute assurance of achieving their objectives 

 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures believe that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing the requisite reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act 

 

our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting these limitations include the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of the system and reasonable resource constraints because of its inherent limitations our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our most recently completed fiscal year we have excluded from our evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting the internal control over financial reporting of vg holding corp “vgh” which we acquired on january 4 2008 as of march 31 2008 total assets excluding goodwill and acquired intangible assets subject to vgh’s internal control over financial reporting represented 2 percent of our consolidated total assets for the period from january 4 2008 through march 31 2008 total net revenue subject to vgh’s internal control over financial reporting represented less than 1 percent of our consolidated net revenue in 

making its assessment management used the criteria set forth in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment our management believes that as of the end of our most recently completed fiscal year our internal control over financial reporting was effective 

 

kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an auditors’ report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that report appears on page 107 

 

changes in internal controls 

 

in preparation for management’s report on internal control over financial reporting we documented and tested the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting during fiscal 2008 there were no significant changes in our internal controls or to our knowledge in other factors that could significantly affect our disclosure controls and procedures

we also sell advertising in many of our games and on our websites 

 

we refer to consoles pcs mobile platforms and online collectively as “platforms” in fiscal 2007 we developed or published products for 13 different platforms since our inception we have published games for over 50 different platforms this platform diversification continues to be a cornerstone of our product strategy 

 

the interactive software games that we develop and publish are broken down into two major categories 1 games developed by our ea studios and 2 games that we copublish with or distribute on behalf of another company through our ea partners group our ea studios games are either developed internally at our development and production studios located in the united states canada england sweden germany singapore china romania and india or by third parties whom we engage to develop games on our behalf at their own development and production studios we market publish and distribute games in over 30 countries throughout the world 

 

we market the products produced by our studios under the ea tm  ea sports tm  ea sports big tm  and pogo tm brands

development of our games 

 

the console handheld pc and online games we publish are developed primarily by our ea studios while the games we offer for cellular handsets are developed primarily by third parties in addition through our ea partners group we team with other game development companies to assist them with the development of games on our behalf for the fiscal years ended march 31 2007 2006 and 2005 research and development expenses were 1041 million 758 million and 633 million respectively 

 

ea studios 

 

we develop packaged goods games internally at our development and production studios located in the united states canada england sweden germany singapore and china we invest in the creation of software tools to more efficiently develop games for multiple platforms we also make investments in facilities and equipment that allow us to create and edit video and audio recordings that are used in our games employees whom we call “executive producers” are responsible for overseeing the development of one or more products or “franchises” a series of sequeled or related products we also engage third parties to develop games on our behalf at their own development and production studios 

 

following our acquisition of jamdat mobile inc in february 2006 we merged our existing cellular handset software game development and publishing business into jamdat’s to establish our ea mobile business we engage third parties to develop games for cellular handsets on our behalf at their own development and production studios and to a lesser extent we develop cellular handset games internally at our development and production studios located in the united states canada england romania and india 

 

we develop online games and content internally at our development and production studios located in the united states canada and singapore in fiscal 2007 we acquired mythic entertainment inc a developer and publisher of massively multiplayer online roleplaying games we also engage third parties to develop online games on our behalf at their own development and production studios 

 

in fiscal 2007 we generated approximately 65 percent of our net revenue from games developed by our ea studios that were initially released during the year as compared to approximately 73 percent in fiscal 2006 excluding titles developed for cellular handsets during fiscal 2007 we released 32 ea studio titles compared to 31 ea studio titles in fiscal 2006 in fiscal 2007 we released over 190000 stock keeping units or skus a version of a title designed for play on a particular platform for cellular handsets 

 

copublishing distribution and third party development 

 

through our ea partners group we team with other game development companies to assist with the development of their own interactive software games which we then publish market and distribute we refer to these types of arrangements as “copublishing” for example in fiscal 2007 we signed a copublishing agreement with namco bandai games america for hellgate london tm  which is being developed by flagship studios 

 

we also distribute interactive software games that are developed and published by other companies an example of one of our recent distribution products is halflife ® 2 episode one  which was developed and published by valve and distributed worldwide by us 

 

we also engage third parties to develop games on our behalf 

 

publishing our games — marketing market segments and distribution 

 

we market our products under four major brand names 

 

 4 

 

in addition our ea partners group operates under a variety of deal types and structures with the intent of making available our publishing marketing and distribution services to game developers who may not have the scale of our resources 

 

in fiscal 2007 we had two titles need for speed carbon and madden nfl 07  published on 10 different platforms each of which represented approximately 11 percent of our total net revenue in fiscal 2006 we had one title need for speed most wanted  published on eight different platforms which represented approximately 10 percent of our total net revenue in fiscal 2005 we had one title need for speed underground 2  published on five different platforms which represented approximately 11 percent of our total net revenue 

 

packaged goods 

 

the console pc and handheld games that we publish are made available to consumers as packaged goods usually bluray disc cd dvd cartridge or universal media disc format that are typically sold in retail stores and through online stores including our own online store in north america and europe our largest markets we sell these packaged goods products primarily to retailers including mass market retailers such as walmart electronics specialty stores such as best buy or game software specialty stores such as gamestop many of our pc products can also be purchased over the internet through digital download 

 

we generated approximately 95 percent of our north american packaged goods net revenue from direct sales to retailers with the remaining net revenue being generated through a limited number of specialized and regional distributors and rack jobbers in markets where we believe direct sales would not be economical outside of north america we derive packaged goods revenue primarily from direct sales to retailers in a few of our smaller markets we sell our packaged goods products through distributors with whom we have written agreements or informal arrangements depending on the business customs of the territories we also distribute products of other companies through our rack jobbing business in switzerland we had direct sales to walmart stores inc which represented approximately 13 percent of total net revenue in both fiscal 2007 and 2006 and approximately 14 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2005 we also had direct sales to gamestop corp which represented approximately 12 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2007 

 

video games — consoles handhelds and pcs historically there have been multiple video game consoles and handheld game players available to consumers and there has been vigorous competition among manufacturers while sony’s playstation ® and playstation 2 consoles have significantly outsold their competitors in the past the playstation 3 faces very strong competition from new platforms such as microsoft’s xbox 360 and the nintendo wii the pc also continues to be a strong interactive game platform similarly while nintendo’s game boy ® advance and nintendo ds are current and historic leaders in the handheld game player market sony’s playstation portable is also a competitor in this segment 

 

video game consoles have historically had a life cycle of four to six years which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well with the release of microsoft’s xbox 360 in 2005 and the releases of sony’s playstation 3 and nintendo’s wii in 2006 our industry is at the beginning of a new cycle as such in fiscal 2008 we expect to release fewer titles for the playstation 2 than in fiscal 2007 a very small number of titles for the xbox and no titles for the nintendo gamecube tm  the following table details select information on some of the console platforms for which we have published titles 

 

 

the following table details select information on some of the handheld video game players for which we have published titles 

 

 

 

in fiscal 2007 we published 26 ea titles for the pc 

 

cellular handsets 

 

through ea mobile we are a leading global publisher of interactive entertainment software playable on cellular handsets including games ring tones images and other content our customers typically purchase and download our games through a wireless carrier’s branded ecommerce service accessed directly from their cellular handsets these wireless carrier services include among others verizon wireless’ get it now  sprint pcs vision  cingular media and vodafone live our customers are charged either a onetime or a monthly subscription fee on their cellular service invoice for the game the wireless carriers generally retain a percentage of the fee and pay the remainder to us the wireless distribution of our games eliminates traditional publishing complexities including physical production packaging shipping inventory management and return processing our customers may also purchase and download games directly from our website 

 

many of our games are designed to take advantage of multimedia enhancements in the latest generation of cellular handsets including highresolution color displays increased processing power improved audio capabilities and increased memory capabilities we publish games in multiple categories designed to appeal to a broad range of wireless subscribers our portfolio is primarily based on intellectual properties that we create and own and wellestablished brands and content that we license from third parties 

 

online 

 

we publish four types of games that are played online by consumers — online casual games massively multiplayer online games midsession games and onlineenabled packaged goods we derive revenue from these games primarily through paid subscriptions advertising and sales of digital content 

 

online casual games we offer online casual games such as card games puzzle games and word games on our website pogocom and on certain online services provided by third parties we had over 15 million paying club pogo subscribers as of march 31 2007 up from 12 million paying subscribers as of march 31 2006 

 

massively multiplayer online games players experience onlineonly “massively multiplayer online games” sometimes called “persistent state world games” or “mmos” as interactive virtual worlds where thousands of other players can interact with one another after installing the software on their pcs players are able to subscribe and interact with other players online we currently offer three mmo games ultima online tm  dark age of camelot ® and the sims online tm  and we are in the process of developing warhammer ® online 

 

midsession games players experience midsession games as interactive virtual worlds where players form small groups and interact with one another we currently offer one midsession game ea sports tm fifa online but anticipate offering more in future years although we offer ea sports fifa online for free players may purchase additional ingame content from us through microtransactions 

 

onlineenabled packaged goods we include online functionality in certain of our pc playstation 3 playstation 2 xbox 360 xbox and psp products which enable consumers to participate in online communities and play against one another via the internet 

 

digital content we offer fullgame downloads and additional content such as booster packs expansion packs and smaller pieces of game content referred to as microtransactions for our pc and consolebased games through our eacom website and online interfaces within game consoles in addition our pogo games are offered through thirdparty websites 

 

advertising we derive revenue from advertising in our games and on our websites 

 

competition 

 

we compete in the entertainment industry for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers with other forms of media such as motion pictures television social networking and music our competitors vary in size and cost structure from very small companies with limited resources to very large diversified corporations with greater financial and marketing resources than ours for example we compete with venture capital funded startups traditional independent video game publishers hardware and software manufacturers casual entertainment websites social networking websites mobile games developers foreign games developers and large media companies we also compete with satellite radio traditional radio and all other forms of entertainment 

 

our business is characterized by the continuous introduction of innovative new titles and the development of new technologies competition is also based on product quality and features timing of product releases brandname recognition quality of ingame content access to distribution channels effectiveness of marketing and price 

 

in addition to competing for product sales we face heavy competition from other software game companies and large media companies to obtain license agreements granting us the right to use intellectual property included in our products some of these content licenses are controlled by the diversified media companies which in some cases have decided to publish their own games based on popular entertainment properties that they control rather than licensing the content to a software game company such as us see “intellectual property” below 

 

sales of packaged goods 

 

the market for our packaged goods products is also characterized by significant price competition and we regularly face pricing pressures from our competitors these pressures have from time to time required us to reduce our prices on certain products our experience has been that software game prices tend to decline once a generation of consoles has been in the market for a significant period of time due to the increasing number of software titles competing for acceptance by consumers and the introduction of new consoles as our industry has transitioned to a new generation of consoles over the past two years we have experienced this kind of price erosion with respect to games for the prior generation of consoles eg playstation 2 xbox and nintendo gamecube 

 

for sales of packaged goods we compete directly with sony microsoft and nintendo each of which develop and publish software for their respective console platforms we also compete with numerous companies which like us develop and publish software games that operate on their consoles these competitors include activision atari capcom koei konami lucasarts midway namco sega taketwo interactive thq and ubisoft among others as discussed above diversified media companies such as fox disney time warner viacom and vivendi are also expanding their software game publishing efforts 

 

sales for cellular handsets 

 

the wireless entertainment applications market segment for which we develop and publish games ring tones and wallpapers for cellular handsets is highly competitive and characterized by frequent product introductions evolving wireless platforms and new technologies as demand for applications continues to increase we expect new competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources to develop and market applications as a result we expect competition in the wireless entertainment market segment to intensify 

 

the current and potential competition in the wireless entertainment applications market segment includes major media companies traditional video game publishing companies wireless carriers wireless software providers and other companies that specialize in wireless entertainment applications we also compete with wireless content aggregators who pool applications from multiple developers and sometimes publishers and 

offer them to carriers or through other sales channels in addition new and existing competitors are beginning to offer wireless entertainment applications on an adsupported basis currently we consider our primary competitors in the wireless entertainment applications market segment to be disney fox mobile entertainment gameloft glu mobile handson mobile namco sony pictures and thq wireless 

 

online sales 

 

the online games market segment is also highly competitive and characterized by frequent product introductions new business models and new platforms as the proportion of households with a broadband connection increases we expect new competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources toward developing online games as a result we expect competition in the online games market segment to intensify 

 

our current and potential competitors in the online games market segment include major media companies traditional video game publishing companies and companies that specialize in online games our competitors in the casual games segment include msn popcap real aol and yahoo in the massively multiplayer online game segment our competitors include atari midway nc soft sony and vivendi games in the midsession game segment our competitors include nexon 

 

intellectual property 

 

like other entertainment companies our business is significantly based on the creation acquisition exploitation and protection of intellectual property some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code patented technology and other technology and trade secrets that we use to develop our games and to make them run properly on the platforms other intellectual property is in the form of audiovisual elements that consumers can see hear and interact with when they are playing our games — we call this form of intellectual property “content” 

 

each of our products embodies a number of separate forms of intellectual property protection the software and the content of our products are copyrighted our products may use patented inventions or trade secrets our product brands and names may be trademarks of ours or others our products may contain voices and likenesses of actors athletes andor commentators which may be protected by personal publicity rights and often contain musical compositions and recordings that are also copyrighted our products also may contain content licensed from others such as trademarks fictional characters storylines and software code 

 

we acquire the rights to include whollyowned intellectual property in our products by creating the intellectual property within our ea studios we also acquire the rights to include proprietary intellectual property in our products through acquisitions we also enter into content license agreements such as those with sports leagues and player associations movie studios and performing talent music labels music publishers and musicians these licenses are typically limited to use of the licensed rights in products for specific time periods in addition our products that play on game consoles handhelds and cellular handsets include technology that is owned by the console manufacturer and licensed nonexclusively to us for use while we may have renewal rights for some licenses our business and the justification for the development of many of our products is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain the intellectual property rights from the owners of these rights at reasonable rates 

 

our products are susceptible to unauthorized copying we typically distribute our pc products using copy protection technology that we license from other companies in addition console manufacturers such as sony typically incorporate security devices in their consoles in an effort to prevent the use of unlicensed products our primary protection against unauthorized use duplication and distribution of our products is enforcement of our copyright and trademark interests we typically own the copyright to the software code as well as the brand or title name trademark under which our products are marketed we register our copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries 

 

significant relationships 

 

hardware platform companies 

 

sony under the terms of agreements we have entered into with sony computer entertainment inc and its affiliates we are authorized to develop and distribute diskbased software products and online content compatible with the playstation 2 playstation 3 and psp pursuant to these agreements we engage sony to supply playstation 2 playstation 3 and psp disks for our products 

 

microsoft under the terms of agreements we have entered into with microsoft corporation and its affiliates we are authorized to develop and distribute dvdbased software products and online content compatible with the xbox and xbox 360 

 

nintendo under the terms of agreements we have entered into with nintendo co ltd and its affiliates we are authorized to develop and distribute proprietary optical format disk products and cartridges compatible with the nintendo gamecube the wii the nintendo ds and game boy advance pursuant to these agreements we engage nintendo to supply wii proprietary optical format disk products and nintendo ds cartridges for our products 

 

cellular handsets 

 

we have agreements to distribute our wireless applications through more than 110 carriers in over 40 countries our customers download our applications to their cellular handsets and their wireless carrier invoices them a onetime fee or monthly subscription fee our carrier distribution agreements establish the fees to be retained by the carrier for distributing our applications these arrangements are typically terminable on short notice the agreements generally do not obligate the carriers to market or distribute any of our applications 

 

content licensors 

 

many of our products are based on or incorporate content and trademarks owned by others for example our ea ea sports and ea sports big products include rights licensed from third parties including major studios publishers artists authors celebrities athletes and the major sports leagues and players associations 

 

inventory working capital backlog manufacturing and suppliers 

 

we manage inventory by communicating with our customers prior to the release of our products and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct and territorybyterritory basis historically we have experienced high turnover of our products and the lead times on reorders of our products are generally short approximately two to three weeks further as discussed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we have practices in place with our customers such as stock balancing and price protection that reduce product returns 

 

we typically ship orders immediately upon receipt to the extent that any backlog may or may not exist at the end of a reporting period it would be both coincidental and an unreliable indicator of future results of any period 

 

the suppliers we use to manufacture our games and related materials include independent third parties sony and nintendo 

 

in many instances we are able to acquire materials on a volumediscount basis we have multiple potential sources of supply for most materials except for the disk component of our playstation 3 playstation 2 psp and wii and nintendo ds cartridges 

 

our online games and cellular handset applications are delivered digitally and therefore are not manufactured 

 

international operations 

 

we conduct business and have whollyowned subsidiaries throughout the world including offices in europe australia asia and latin america international net revenue increased by 4 percent to 1425 billion or 

46 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2007 compared to 1367 billion or 46 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2006 

 

the amounts of net revenue and longlived assets attributable to each of our geographic regions for each of the last three fiscal years are set forth in note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

 

seasonality 

 

our business is highly seasonal we typically experience our highest sales volume in the holiday season quarter ending in december and a seasonal low in sales volume in the quarter ending in june starting in fiscal 2008 we expect to defer the recognition of a significant amount of net revenue related to our onlineenabled packaged goods over an extended period of time which we currently estimate to be six months as a result the quarter in which we generate the highest sales volume may be different than the quarter in which we recognize the highest net revenue our results can also vary based on a number of factors including title release dates consumer demand for our products shipment schedules and our revenue recognition policies 

 

employees 

 

as of march 31 2007 we employed approximately 7900 people of whom over 4500 were outside the united states we believe that our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is a critical factor in the successful development of our products and that our future success will depend in large measure on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees less than 3 percent of our employees all of whom work for our swedish development subsidiary are represented by a union guild or other collective bargaining organization

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs our business and financial performance could be harmed our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may harm our business and financial performance 

 

our business is highly dependent on the success and availability of video game hardware systems manufactured by third parties as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products for these systems 

 

we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play on video game hardware systems which we also refer to as “platforms” manufactured by third parties such as sony’s playstation 2 and playstation 3 microsoft’s xbox 360 and nintendo’s wii the success of our business is driven in large part by the commercial success and adequate supply of these video game hardware systems our ability to accurately predict which systems will be successful in the marketplace and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these systems we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of anticipated product ship dates a platform for which we are developing products may not succeed or may have a shorter life cycle than anticipated if consumer demand for the systems for which we are developing products are lower than our expectations our revenue will suffer we may be unable to fully recover the investments we have made in developing our products and our financial performance will be harmed alternatively a system for which we have not devoted significant resources could be more successful than we had initially anticipated causing us to miss out on meaningful revenue opportunities 

 

our industry is cyclical and is beginning its next cycle during the transition consumers may be slower to adopt new video game systems than we anticipate and our operating results may suffer and become more difficult to predict 

 

video game hardware systems have historically had a life cycle of four to six years which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well microsoft launched the xbox 360 in november 2005 while sony and nintendo launched the playstation 3 and the wii respectively in november 2006 we have continued to develop and market new titles for priorgeneration video game systems such as the playstation 2 while also making significant investments in products for the new systems as the priorgeneration systems reach the end of their life cycle and the installed base of the new systems continues to grow our sales of video games for priorgeneration systems will continue to decline as 1 we produce fewer titles for priorgeneration systems 2 consumers replace their priorgeneration systems with the new systems andor 3 consumers defer game software purchases until they are able to purchase a new video game hardware system this decline in priorgeneration product sales may be greater than we anticipate and sales of products for the new platforms may be lower than we anticipate moreover we expect development costs for the new video game systems to be greater on a pertitle basis than development costs for priorgeneration video game systems as a result of these factors during the next several quarters we expect our operating results to be more volatile and difficult to predict which could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly 

 

if we do not consistently meet our product development schedules our operating results will be adversely affected 

 

our business is highly seasonal with the highest levels of consumer demand and a significant percentage of our sales occurring in the december quarter in addition we seek to release many of our products in conjunction with specific events such as the release of a related movie or the beginning of a sports season or major sporting event if we miss these key selling periods for any reason including product delays or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have developed products our sales will suffer disproportionately 

likewise if a key event to which our product release schedule is tied were to be delayed or cancelled our sales would also suffer disproportionately our ability to meet product development schedules is affected by a number of factors including the creative processes involved the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams required by the increasing complexity of our products and the platforms for which they are developed and the need to finetune our products prior to their release we have experienced development delays for our products in the past which caused us to push back release dates in the future any failure to meet anticipated production or release schedules would likely result in a delay of revenue andor possibly a significant shortfall in our revenue harm our profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different than anticipated 

 

our business is intensely competitive and “hit” driven if we do not continue to deliver “hit” products and services or if consumers prefer our competitors’ products or services over our own our operating results could suffer 

 

competition in our industry is intense and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge in the united states and abroad while many new products and services are regularly introduced only a relatively small number of “hit” titles accounts for a significant portion of total revenue in our industry hit products or services offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause revenue generated from our products and services to fall below expectations if our competitors develop more successful products or services offer competitive products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering a better value proposition such as payforplay or subscriptionbased models or if we do not continue to develop consistently highquality and wellreceived products and services our revenue margins and profitability will decline 

 

technology changes rapidly in our business and if we fail to anticipate or successfully implement new technologies or the manner in which people play our games the quality timeliness and competitiveness of our products and services will suffer 

 

rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate sometimes years in advance which technologies we must implement and take advantage of in order to make our products and services competitive in the market therefore we usually start our product development with a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve we may not be able to achieve these goals or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly and effectively than we can in either case our products and services may be technologically inferior to our competitors’ less appealing to consumers or both if we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule of our products and services then we may delay their release until these technology goals can be achieved which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses alternatively we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies either to preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up with our competition which would increase our development expenses 

 

the video game hardware manufacturers set the royalty rates and other fees that we must pay to publish games for their platforms and therefore have significant influence on our costs if one or more of these manufacturers adopt a different fee structure for future game consoles our profitability will be materially impacted 

 

in order to publish products for a video game system such as the xbox 360 playstation 3 or wii we must take a license from the manufacturer which gives it the opportunity to set the fee structure that we must pay in order to publish games for that platform similarly certain manufacturers have retained the flexibility to change their fee structures or adopt different fee structures for online gameplay and other new features for their consoles the control that hardware manufacturers have over the fee structures for their platforms and online access makes it difficult for us to predict our costs profitability and impact on margins because publishing products for video game systems is the largest portion of our business any increase in fee structures would significantly harm our ability to generate revenues andor profits 

 

the video game hardware manufacturers are among our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of andor access to our video game products if they do not approve our products we will be unable to ship to our customers 

 

our agreements with hardware licensors such as sony for the playstation 3 microsoft for the xbox 360 and nintendo for the wii typically give significant control to the licensor over the approval and manufacturing of our products which could in certain circumstances leave us unable to get our products approved manufactured and shipped to customers these hardware licensors are also among our chief competitors generally control of the approval and manufacturing process by the hardware licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently while we believe that our relationships with our hardware licensors are currently good the potential for these licensors to delay or refuse to approve or manufacture our products exists such occurrences would harm our business and our financial performance 

 

we also require compatibility code and the consent of microsoft sony and nintendo in order to include online capabilities in our products for their respective platforms as online capabilities for video game systems become more significant microsoft sony and nintendo could restrict the manner in which we provide online capabilities for our products if microsoft sony or nintendo refused to approve our products with online capabilities or significantly impacted the financial terms on which these services are offered to our customers our business could be harmed 

 

if we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to intellectual property we will publish fewer hit titles and our revenue profitability and cash flows will decline competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs 

 

many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our ea sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players’ associations similarly many of our other hit franchises such as the godfather harry potter and lord of the rings are based on key film and literary licenses competition for these licenses is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses or obtain additional licenses with significant commercial value our revenues and profitability will decline significantly competition for these licenses may also drive up the advances guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor which could significantly increase our costs 

 

our business is subject to risks generally associated with the entertainment industry any of which could significantly harm our operating results 

 

our business is subject to risks that are generally associated with the entertainment industry many of which are beyond our control these risks could negatively impact our operating results and include the popularity price and timing of our games and the platforms on which they are played economic conditions that adversely affect discretionary consumer spending changes in consumer demographics the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted 

 

if we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel we will be unable to effectively conduct our business 

 

the market for technical creative marketing and other personnel essential to the development and marketing of our products and management of our businesses is extremely competitive our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of executives and key creative talent if we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need or replace key employees following their departure our ability to develop and manage our businesses will be impaired 

 

if patent claims continue to be asserted against us we may be unable to sustain our current business models or profits or we may be precluded from pursuing new business opportunities in the future 

 

many patents have been issued that may apply to widelyused game technologies or to potential new modes of delivering playing or monetizing game software products for example infringement claims under many issued patents are now being asserted against interactive software or online game sites several such claims 

have been asserted against us we incur substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims regardless of the merits of the claims in the event that there is a determination that we have infringed a thirdparty patent we could incur significant monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future which could negatively impact our operating results we may also discover that future opportunities to provide new and innovative modes of game play and game delivery to consumers may be precluded by existing patents that we are unable to license on reasonable terms 

 

other intellectual property claims may increase our product costs or require us to cease selling affected products 

 

many of our products include extremely realistic graphical images and we expect that as technology continues to advance images will become even more realistic some of the images and other content are based on realworld examples that may inadvertently infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement from time to time we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims existing or future infringement claims against us whether valid or not may be time consuming and expensive to defend such claims or litigations could require us to stop selling the affected products redesign those products to avoid infringement or obtain a license all of which would be costly and harm our business 

 

from time to time we may become involved in other legal proceedings which could adversely affect us 

 

we are currently and from time to time in the future may become subject to other legal proceedings claims litigation and government investigations or inquiries which could be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations in addition the outcome of any legal proceedings claims litigation investigations or inquiries may be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

 

our business our products and our distribution are subject to increasing regulation of content consumer privacy distribution and online hosting and delivery in the key territories in which we conduct business if we do not successfully respond to these regulations our business may suffer 

 

legislation is continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution for example data and consumer protection laws in the united states and europe impose various restrictions on our web sites those rules vary by territory although the internet recognizes no geographical boundaries other countries such as germany have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged games and those transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current united states laws in the united states the federal and several state governments are continually considering content restrictions on products such as ours as well as restrictions on distribution of such products for example recent legislation has been adopted in several states and could be proposed at the federal level that prohibits the sale of certain games eg violent games or those with “m mature” or “ao adults only” ratings to minors any one or more of these factors could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers by limiting the size of the potential market for our products and by requiring costly additional differentiation between products for different territories to address varying regulations 

 

if one or more of our titles were found to contain hidden objectionable content our business could suffer 

 

throughout the history of our industry many video games have been designed to include certain hidden content and gameplay features that are accessible through the use of ingame cheat codes or other technological means that are intended to enhance the gameplay experience however in several recent cases hidden content or features have been found to be included in other publishers’ products by an employee who was not authorized to do so or by an outside developer without the knowledge of the publisher from time to time some hidden content and features have contained profanity graphic violence and sexually explicit or otherwise objectionable material in a few cases the entertainment software ratings board “esrb” has reacted to discoveries of hidden content and features by reviewing the rating that was originally assigned to the product requiring the publisher to change the game packaging andor fining the publisher retailers have 

on occasion reacted to the discovery of such hidden content by removing these games from their shelves refusing to sell them and demanding that their publishers accept them as product returns likewise consumers have reacted to the revelation of hidden content by refusing to purchase such games demanding refunds for games they’ve already purchased and refraining from buying other games published by the company whose game contained the objectionable material 

 

we have implemented preventative measures designed to reduce the possibility of hidden objectionable content from appearing in the video games we publish nonetheless these preventative measures are subject to human error circumvention overriding and reasonable resource constraints if a video game we published were found to contain hidden objectionable content the esrb could demand that we recall a game and change its packaging to reflect a revised rating retailers could refuse to sell it and demand we accept the return of any unsold copies or returns from customers and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand that we refund their money this could have a material negative impact on our operating results and financial condition in addition our reputation could be harmed which could impact sales of other video games we sell if any of these consequences were to occur our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed 

 

if we ship defective products our operating results could suffer 

 

products such as ours are extremely complex software programs and are difficult to develop manufacture and distribute we have quality controls in place to detect defects in the software media and packaging of our products before they are released nonetheless these quality controls are subject to human error overriding and reasonable resource constraints therefore these quality controls and preventative measures may not be effective in detecting defects in our products before they have been reproduced and released into the marketplace in such an event we could be required to recall a product or we may find it necessary to voluntarily recall a product andor scrap defective inventory which could significantly harm our business and operating results 

 

our international net revenue is subject to currency fluctuations 

 

for the fiscal year ended march 31 2007 international net revenue comprised 46 percent of our total net revenue we expect foreign sales to continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue such sales may be subject to unexpected regulatory requirements tariffs and other barriers additionally foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies which may fluctuate against the us dollar while we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate some foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities primarily certain intercompany receivables and payables and from time to time foreign currency option contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions primarily related to a portion of the revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currency generated by our operational subsidiaries our results of operations including our reported net revenue and net income and financial condition would be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations particularly the euro british pound sterling and canadian dollar 

 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 

 

we are also required to estimate what our taxes will be in the future although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the estimation process and applicable laws are inherently uncertain and our estimates are not binding on tax authorities our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by our profit level by changes in our business including the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the elections we make changes in applicable tax laws as well as other factors further our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should our ultimate tax liability exceed our estimates our income tax provision and net income or loss could be materially affected 

 

we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our consolidated pretax income or loss as a result in absolute dollar terms our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pretax income or loss than higher levels in addition at lower levels of pretax income or loss our effective tax rate will be more volatile 

 

in addition the rules for tax accounting have recently been changed in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation “fin” no 48 “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 ” which provides new rules for the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 109 “ accounting for income taxes ” see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we are evaluating what impact the adoption of fin no 48 will have on our consolidated financial statements as it becomes effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 this impact could be material and our future effective tax rates could be more volatile 

 

we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under examination by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations changes in our business or changes in applicable tax rules will not have an adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition 

 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves 

 

as a result of the enactment of the sarbanesoxley act and the review of accounting policies by the sec and national and international accounting standards bodies the frequency of accounting policy changes may accelerate for example as discussed above fin no 48 will affect the way we account for income taxes and could have a material impact on our financial results similarly changes in accounting standards relating to stockbased compensation require us to recognize significantly greater expense than we had been recognizing prior to the adoption of the new standard likewise policies affecting software revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products and services for example as our industry transitions to new video game hardware systems we expect a more significant portion of our console and pc games will be onlineenabled and as a result we will be required to recognize the related revenue over an extended period of time rather than at the time of sale as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue and taxes could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

 

we have begun the implementation of a new set of financial information systems in anticipation of a significant increase in deferred net revenue which if not completed in a successful and timely manner could impede our ability to accurately process prepare and analyze important financial data 

 

we have begun to implement a new set of financial information systems and processes designed to help us accurately process prepare and analyze the significant amount of net revenue from onlineenabled packaged goods we expect to recognize on a deferred basis beginning in fiscal 2008 the successful implementation of these systems and processes entails a number of risks due to the complexity of the systems the number of people affected companywide and the implementation process itself while testing of these new systems and processes and training of employees are done in advance of implementation there are inherent limitations in our ability to simulate a fullscale operating environment in advance of implementation there can be no assurance that the implementation of these financial information systems and processes will not impede our ability to accurately and timely process prepare and analyze the financial data we use in making operating decisions and which form the basis of the financial information we include in the periodic reports we file with the sec 

 

changes in our worldwide operating structure or the adoption of new products and distribution models could have adverse tax consequences 

 

as we expand our international operations adopt new products and new distribution models implement changes to our operating structure or undertake intercompany transactions in light of changing tax laws expiring rulings acquisitions and our current and anticipated business and operational requirements our tax expense could increase for example in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we repatriated 375 million under the america jobs creation act of 2004 as a result we recognized an additional onetime tax expense in fiscal 2006 of 17 million 

 

the majority of our sales are made to a relatively small number of key customers if these customers reduce their purchases of our products or become unable to pay for them our business could be harmed 

 

in our fiscal year ended march 31 2007 over 70 percent of our us sales were made to seven key customers in europe our top ten customers accounted for approximately 31 percent of our sales in that territory during the year ended march 31 2007 worldwide we had direct sales to two customers walmart stores and gamestop corp inc which represented approximately 13 percent and 12 percent respectively of total net revenue in the year ended march 31 2007 though our products are available to consumers through a variety of retailers the concentration of our sales in one or a few large customers could lead to a shortterm disruption in our sales if one or more of these customers significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to carry our products and could make us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers became unable to pay for our products additionally our receivables from these large customers increase significantly in the december quarter as they stock up for the holiday selling season also having such a large portion of our total net revenue concentrated in a few customers could reduce our negotiating leverage with these customers 

 

acquisitions investments and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties dilution to our investors and other negative consequences 

 

we have engaged in evaluated and expect to continue to engage in and evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions including i acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets ii minority investments in strategic partners and iii investments in new interactive entertainment businesses for example online and mobile games any of these strategic transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations although we regularly search for opportunities to engage in strategic transactions we may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities we may not be able to consummate potential acquisitions or investments or an acquisition or investment may not enhance our business or may decrease rather than increase our earnings in addition the process of integrating an acquired company or business or successfully exploiting acquired intellectual property or other assets could divert a significant amount of our management’s time and focus and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures additional risks we face include 

 

 19 

 

future acquisitions and investments could involve the issuance of our equity securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased expenses any of which could harm our financial condition our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

 

our products are subject to the threat of piracy by a variety of organizations and individuals if we are not successful in combating and preventing piracy our sales and profitability could be harmed significantly 

 

in many countries around the world more pirated copies of our products are sold than legitimate copies though we believe piracy has not had a material impact on our operating results to date highly organized pirate operations have been expanding globally in addition the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures we use in our products the availability of broadband access to the internet the ability to download pirated copies of our games from various internet sites and the widespread proliferation of internet cafes using pirated copies of our products all have contributed to ongoing and expanding piracy though we take steps to make the unauthorized copying and distribution of our products more difficult as do the manufacturers of consoles on which our games are played these efforts may not be successful in controlling the piracy of our products this could have a negative effect on our growth and profitability in the future 

 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors above as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts’ earnings estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts’ and investors’ expectations to factors affecting the computer software internet entertainment media or electronics industries or to national or international economic conditions

the following diagram depicts the locations of our most significant facilities throughout the world 

 

we currently own a 418000squarefoot product development studio facility in burnaby british columbia canada and a 122000squarefoot administrative sales and development facility in chertsey england in addition to the properties we own we lease approximately 27 million square feet of facilities including significant leases for our headquarters in redwood city california our studios in los angeles california and orlando florida and our distribution center in louisville kentucky our leased space is summarized as follows in square feet 

 

 

 

redwood city headquarters 

 

in february 1995 we entered into a buildtosuit lease “phase one lease” with a thirdparty lessor for our headquarters facilities in redwood city california “phase one facilities” the phase one facilities comprise a total of approximately 350000 square feet and provide space for sales marketing administration and research and development functions in july 2001 the lessor refinanced the phase one lease with keybank national association through july 2006 the phase one lease expires in january 2039 subject to early termination in the event the underlying financing between the lessor and its lenders is not extended subject to certain terms and conditions we may purchase the phase one facilities or arrange for the sale of the phase one facilities to a third party 

 

pursuant to the terms of the phase one lease we have an option to purchase the phase one facilities at any time for a purchase price of 132 million in the event of a sale to a third party if the sale price is less than 132 million we will be obligated to reimburse the difference between the actual sale price and 132 million up to a maximum of 117 million subject to certain provisions of the phase one lease as amended 

 

on may 26 2006 the lessor extended its loan financing underlying the phase one lease with its lenders through july 2007 and on may 14 2007 the lenders extended this financing again for an additional year through july 2008 we may request on behalf of the lessor and subject to lender approval an additional oneyear extension of the loan financing between the lessor and the lenders in the event the lessor’s loan financing with the lenders is not extended we may loan to the lessor approximately 90 percent of the financing and require the lessor to extend the remainder through july 2009 otherwise the lease will terminate we account for the phase one lease arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with sfas no 13 “accounting for leases”  as amended 

 

in december 2000 we entered into a second buildtosuit lease “phase two lease” with keybank national association for a five and onehalf year term beginning in december 2000 to expand our redwood city california headquarters facilities and develop adjacent property “phase two facilities” construction of the phase two facilities was completed in june 2002 the phase two facilities comprise a total of approximately 310000 square feet and provide space for sales marketing administration and research and development functions subject to certain terms and conditions we may purchase the phase two facilities or arrange for the sale of the phase two facilities to a third party 

 

pursuant to the terms of the phase two lease we have an option to purchase the phase two facilities at any time for a purchase price of 115 million in the event of a sale to a third party if the sale price is less than 115 million we will be obligated to reimburse the difference between the actual sale price and 115 million up to a maximum of 105 million subject to certain provisions of the phase two lease as amended 

 

on may 26 2006 the lessor extended the phase two lease through july 2009 subject to early termination in the event the underlying loan financing between the lessor and its lenders is not extended concurrently with the extension of the lease the lessor extended the loan financing underlying the phase two lease with its 

lenders through july 2007 on may 14 2007 the lenders extended this financing again for an additional year through july 2008 we may request on behalf of the lessor and subject to lender approval an additional oneyear extension of the loan financing between the lessor and the lenders in the event the lessor’s loan financing with the lenders is not extended we may loan to the lessor approximately 90 percent of the financing and require the lessor to extend the remainder through july 2009 otherwise the lease will terminate we account for the phase two lease arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with sfas no 13 as amended 

 

we believe that as of march 31 2007 the estimated fair values of both properties under these operating leases exceeded their respective guaranteed residual values 

 

guildford orlando los angeles and vancouver studios louisville distribution center 

 

in february 2006 we entered into an agreement with an independent third party to lease a studio facility in guildford surrey united kingdom which commenced in june 2006 and will expire in may 2016 the facility comprises a total of approximately 95000 square feet which we use for research and development functions our rental obligation under this agreement is approximately 33 million over the initial tenyear term of the lease

in addition to the properties discussed above we have other properties under lease which have been included in our restructuring costs as discussed in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report while we continually evaluate our facility requirements we believe that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate our future needs

on september 14 2006 we received an informal inquiry from the securities and exchange commission requesting certain documents and information relating to our stock option grant practices from january 1 1997 through the date of the letter we have cooperated to date with all matters related to this request we most recently provided the sec with information in december 2006 the sec has not asked for any further information since that time 

 

we are also subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we believe that any liability from any reasonably foreseeable disposition of such claims and litigation individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

overview 

 

the following overview is a toplevel discussion of our operating results as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers is important in order to understand our results for the fiscal year ended march 31 2007 as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form 10k including in the “business” section and the “risk factors” above the remainder of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” or the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

 

  

we develop market publish and distribute interactive software games that are playable by consumers on video game consoles such as the sony playstation 2 and playstation 3 microsoft xbox 360 and nintendo wii personal computers mobile platforms including cellular handsets and handheld game players such as the playstation portable “psp” and the nintendo ds and online over the internet and other proprietary online networks some of our games are based on content that we license from others eg madden nfl football the godfather and fifa soccer and some of our games are based on our own whollyowned intellectual property eg the sims and need for speed our goal is to publish titles with massmarket appeal which often means translating and localizing them for sale in nonenglish speaking countries in addition we also attempt to create software game “franchises” that allow us to publish new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the same property examples of this franchise approach are the annual iterations of our sportsbased products eg madden nfl football ncaa ® football and fifa soccer whollyowned properties that can be successfully sequeled eg the sims need for speed and battlefield and titles based on longlived literary andor movie properties eg lord of the rings and harry potter 

 

  

total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2007 was 3091 billion up 5 percent as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2006 total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2007 was driven by sales of madden nfl 07  need for speed carbon  fifa 07  the sims 2 pets  and ncaa ® football 07 four titles sold more than five million units in the fiscal year ended march 31 2007 — madden nfl 07  need for speed carbon  fifa 07  and the sims 2 pets 

 

net income for the fiscal year ended march 31 2007 was 76 million as compared to 236 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2006 diluted net income per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2007 was 024 as compared to 075 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2006 although net revenue increased in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 net income decreased due to an increase in our operating expenses as a result of our adoption of sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sfas no 123r” “ share based payment ” an increase in our annual bonus expense and an increase in additional personnelrelated costs due to an increase in headcount these increases were further mitigated by a decrease in our income tax provision 

 

we generated 397 million of cash from operating activities during the year ended march 31 2007 as compared to 596 million for fiscal 2006 the decrease in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to the timing of the collection of our receivables as a result of collecting a greater amount of our receivables during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2007 

 

stockbased compensation beginning in fiscal 2007 we adopted sfas no 123r which requires us to recognize the cost resulting from all sharebased payment transactions in our financial statements using a fairvaluebased method see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the following table summarizes our stockbased compensation expense resulting from stock options restricted stock restricted 

stock units and our employee stock purchase plan included in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended march 31 2007 2006 and 2005 in millions 

 

 

 

as of march 31 2007 our total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options was 153 million and is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage service period of 16 years as of march 31 2007 our total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock and restricted stock units collectively referred to as “restricted stock rights” was 82 million and is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage service period of 23 years 

 

  

transition to a new generation of consoles video game hardware systems have historically had a life cycle of four to six years which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well microsoft launched the xbox 360 in november 2005 while sony and nintendo launched the playstation 3 and the wii respectively in november 2006 we have continued to develop and market new titles for priorgeneration video game systems such as the playstation 2 while also making significant investments in products for the new systems as the priorgeneration systems reach the end of their life cycle and the installed base of the new systems continues to grow our sales of video games for priorgeneration systems will continue to decline as 1 we produce fewer titles for priorgeneration systems 2 consumers replace their priorgeneration systems with the new systems andor 3 consumers reduce game software purchases for certain priorgeneration consoles generally for example until they are able to purchase a new video game hardware system this decline in priorgeneration product sales could ultimately be greater than we anticipate and sales of products for the new platforms may be lower than we anticipate moreover we expect development costs for the new video game systems to be greater on a pertitle basis than development costs for priorgeneration video game systems 

 

we have incurred increased costs during this transition as we have continued to develop and market new titles for certain priorgeneration video game platforms while also making significant investments in products for the new generation platforms as we move through the life cycle of priorgeneration consoles we will continue to devote significant resources to the development of priorgeneration titles while at the same time spending more for the new generation of platforms and technology as a result of these factors we expect research and development expenses to increase in fiscal 2008 

 

investment in online today we generate net revenue from a variety of online products and services including casual games and downloadable content marketed under our pogo brand persistent state world games such as ultima online and dark age of camelot pcbased downloadable content and onlineenabled packaged goods as the nature of online game offerings expands and evolves we anticipate longterm opportunities for growth in this area for example we expect that consumers will take advantage of the online connectivity of the new generation of consoles at a much higher rate than they have on priorgeneration consoles allowing more consumers to enhance their gameplay experience through multiplayer activity communitybuilding and downloading content we plan to increase the amount of content available for download on the pc consoles and cell phones increase the number of games with dynamic ingame advertising and to increase the number of pcbased games that can be downloaded digitally in addition we plan to expand our casual game offerings internationally and to invest in growing genres such as midsession 

games to further enhance our online offerings we acquired mythic a developer and publisher of massively multiplayer online roleplaying games in july 2006 we intend to make significant investments in online products infrastructure and services and believe that online gameplay will become an increasingly important part of our business in the long term 

 

significantly increased deferred revenue for onlineenabled games the ubiquity of highspeed internet access and the integration of network connectivity into new generation game consoles are expected to increase demand for games with onlineenabled features to address this demand many of our software products are developed with the ability to be connected to and played via the internet in order for consumers to participate in online communities and play against one another via the internet we or through outsourced arrangements with third parties have servers which support the various online services we provide to consumers such as matchmaking roster updates tournaments and player rankings in situations where we do not separately sell these online services we consider the sale of the software product as a “bundle” sale or multiple element arrangement in which we sell both the software product and the online service for one combined price 

 

through fiscal 2007 for accounting purposes vendor specific objective evidence of fair value existed for the online service accordingly we allocated the revenue collected from the sale of the software product between the online service and the software product and recognized the amounts allocated to each element separately however starting in fiscal 2008 for accounting purposes the required vendor specific objective evidence of fair value will not exist for the online services this will prevent us from allocating and recognizing revenue related to the software product and the online services separately accordingly we will begin to recognize all of the revenue from the sale of our onlineenabled software products related to the pc playstation 2 playstation 3 and the psp platforms over the estimated online service period currently expected to be recognized over six months after the month of sale we anticipate that in fiscal 2008 we will likely defer approximately 400 to 500 million in net revenue from the sale of these onlineenabled software products into fiscal 2009 on a quarterly basis this amount will vary significantly depending upon the timing of the release of the onlineenabled software product and the sales volume of such products in addition we will expense the cost of goods sold related to these transactions when delivered as of march 31 2007 deferred net revenue related to packaged goods and digital content ie content delivered to the consumer via the internet including 1 digital downloads and 2 certain incremental content related to our core subscription services playable only online which are types of “microtransactions” was 23 million 

 

expansion of mobile platforms advances in mobile technology have resulted in a variety of new and evolving platforms for onthego interactive entertainment that appeal to a broader demographic of consumers our efforts to capitalize on the growth in mobile interactive entertainment are focused in two broad areas — packaged goods games for handheld game systems and downloadable games for cellular handsets 

 

we have developed and published games for a variety of handheld platforms including the nintendo game boy and game boy advance for several years the introductions of the sony psp and the nintendo ds with their enhanced graphics deeper gameplay and online functionality provide a richer mobile gaming experience for consumers 

 

we expect sales of games for cellular handsets to continue to be an increasingly important part of our business worldwide to accelerate our position in this growing segment in february 2006 we acquired jamdat mobile inc a global publisher of wireless games and other wireless entertainment applications as a result of this acquisition our net revenue from games for cellular handsets increased significantly in fiscal 2007 as compared to prior years likewise the acquisition along with the additional investment required to grow this portion of our business globally resulted in increased license royalties development and operating expenses in fiscal 2007 

 

as mobile technology continues to evolve and the installed base of both handheld game systems and gameenabled cellular phones continues to expand we anticipate that sales of our titles for mobile platforms — for both handhelds and cellular handsets — will become an increasingly important part of our business 

 

acquisitions investments and strategic transactions we have engaged in evaluated and expect to continue to engage in and evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions including 1 acquisitions of 

companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets and 2 investments in new interactive entertainment businesses such as online and mobile games in may 2007 we announced that we entered into a licensing agreement with and expect to make a strategic equity investment in the9 limited a leading online game operator in china on or around may 29 2007 the licensing agreement gives the9 exclusive publishing rights for ea sports fifa online in mainland china in april 2007 we expanded our commercial agreements with and made strategic equity investments in neowiz corporation and its online gaming subsidiary neowiz games based in korea neowiz is an online media and gaming company with which we partnered in 2006 to launch ea sports fifa online in korea in october 2006 the remaining outstanding shares of digital illusions ce “dice” were purchased thereby completing the acquisition of the remaining minority interest of dice in july 2006 we acquired mythic as part of our efforts to accelerate our growth in the massively multiplayer online roleplaying market in fiscal 2007 we also acquired singshot media a san franciscobased online karaoke community as well as substantially all of the assets of headgate studios a utahbased developer with which we had partnered since 2000 to develop certain ea franchises and phenomic game development a developer of real time strategy games based in germany in fiscal 2006 we acquired jamdat as part of our efforts to accelerate our growth in mobile gaming 

 

international expansion we expect international sales to remain a fundamental part of our business as part of our international expansion strategy we may seek to partner with established local companies through acquisitions joint ventures minority investments or other similar arrangements we are planning to expand our development and business activities internationally we believe that in order to succeed internationally it is important to locally develop content that is specifically directed toward local cultures and consumers as such we expect to continue to devote resources to hiring local development talent and expanding our infrastructure 

 

sales of “hit” titles sales of “hit” titles several of which were top sellers in a number of countries contributed significantly to our net revenue in fiscal 2007 our topselling titles across all platforms worldwide during the year ended march 31 2007 were madden nfl 07  need for speed carbon  fifa 07  the sims 2 pets and ncaa football 07 hit titles are important to our financial performance because they benefit from overall economies of scale we have developed and it is our objective to continue to develop many of our hit titles to become franchise titles that can be regularly iterated 

 

increasing licensing costs we generate a significant portion of our net revenue and operating income from games based on licensed content such as fifa soccer we have recently entered into new licenses and renewed older licenses some of which may contain higher royalty rates or guarantees than similar license agreements we have entered into in the past we believe these licenses and the product franchises they support will continue to be important to our future operations but the higher costs of these licenses will negatively impact our gross margins 

 

foreign currency exchange impact net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately 46 percent of our total net revenue during both fiscal 2007 and 2006 our international net revenue was primarily driven by sales in europe and to a much lesser extent in asia yearoveryear foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on our net revenue of 53 million or 2 percent for the year ended march 31 2007 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities contingent assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown as a result actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

 

revenue recognition sales returns allowances and bad debt reserves 

 

we principally derive revenue from sales of interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation 3 xbox 360 and wii pcs and mobile platforms including handheld game players such as the sony psp nintendo ds and nintendo game boy advance and cellular handsets we evaluate the recognition of revenue based on the criteria set forth in statement of position “sop” 972 “software revenue recognition”  as amended by sop 989 “modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” and staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 104 “revenue recognition” we evaluate revenue recognition using the following basic criteria and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met 

 

  

determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report for example for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to 1 determine whether and when each element has been delivered 2 determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services 3 determine whether vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” exists for each undelivered element and 4 allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver changes to any of these assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period for example some of our packaged goods products are sold with online services prior to and through fiscal 2007 we had been able to determine vsoe for the online services to be delivered therefore we have been able to allocate the total price received from the combined product and online service sale between these two elements and recognize the related revenue separately however starting in fiscal 2008 vsoe will not exist for the online services to be delivered for certain platforms and all revenue from these transactions will be recognized over the estimated online service period more specifically we will begin to recognize the revenue from sales of certain onlineenabled packaged goods on a straightline basis over six months after the month of sale accordingly this relatively small change from having vsoe for online hosting services to no longer having vsoe will have a significant effect on our reported results 

 

determining whether a transaction constitutes an online game service transaction or a download of a product requires judgment and can be difficult the accounting for these transactions is significantly different revenue from product downloads is recognized when the download occurs assuming all other recognition criteria are met revenue from online game services is recognized as the services are rendered if the service period is not defined we recognize the revenue over the estimated service period determining the estimated service period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage 

 

product revenue including sales to resellers and distributors “channel partners” is recognized when the above criteria are met we reduce product revenue for estimated future returns price protection and other offerings which may occur with our customers and channel partners in certain countries we have stockbalancing programs for our pc and video game system products which allow for the exchange of these 

products by resellers under certain circumstances it is our general practice to exchange products or give credits rather than to give cash refunds 

 

in certain countries from time to time we decide to provide price protection for both our pc and video game system products when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances we analyze historical returns current sellthrough of distributor and retailer inventory of our products current trends in retail and the video game segment changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors in addition we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods 

 

in the future actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms product updates or competing products for example the risk of product returns andor price protection for our products may continue to increase as the playstation 2 console moves through its lifecycle while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters these estimates are inherently subjective accordingly if our estimates changed our returns and price protection reserves would change which would impact the total net revenue we report for example if actual returns andor price protection were significantly greater than the reserves we have established our actual results would decrease our reported total net revenue conversely if actual returns andor price protection were significantly less than our reserves this would increase our reported total net revenue 

 

significant judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends and historical experience depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly 

 

royalties and licenses 

 

our royalty expenses consist of payments to 1 content licensors 2 independent software developers and 3 copublishing and distribution affiliates license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities professional sports organizations movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks copyrights personal publicity rights content andor other intellectual property royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games copublishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of product 

 

royaltybased obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid these royaltybased obligations are generally expensed to cost of goods sold generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on expected net product sales significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors including 1 the total number of titles subject to the contract 2 the timing of the release of these titles 3 the number of software units we expect to sell which can be impacted by a number of variables including product quality and competition and 4 future pricing determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products accordingly if our future revenue projections change our effective royalty rates would change which could impact the royalty expense we recognize prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and copublishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product and therefore we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product accordingly payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally amortized to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred payments due after completion of the product primarily royaltybased in nature are generally expensed as cost of goods sold 

 

our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor when performance remains with the licensor we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract minimum royalty payment obligations are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next twelve months as of march 31 2007 and 2006 approximately 9 million of minimum guaranteed royalty obligations had been recognized in each period 

 

each quarter we also evaluate the future realization of our royaltybased assets as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales any impairments determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense impairments determined postlaunch are charged to cost of goods sold in either case we rely on estimated revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties and commitments if actual sales or revised revenue estimates fall below the initial revenue estimate then the actual charge taken may be greater in any given quarter than anticipated we had no impairments during fiscal 2007 during fiscal 2006 and 2005 we recorded impairment charges of 16 million and 8 million respectively 

 

valuation of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

we evaluate both purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets in order to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in value exists this evaluation requires us to estimate among other things the remaining useful lives of the assets and future cash flows of the business these evaluations and estimates require the use of judgment our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates 

 

under current accounting standards we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets in order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred management makes various assumptions about the future value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash flows our future net cash flows are primarily dependent on the sale of products for play on proprietary video game consoles handheld game players pcs and cellular handsets “platforms” the sales of our products are affected by our ability to accurately predict which platforms and which products we develop will be successful also our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules due to product sales shortfalls we may not realize the future net cash flows necessary to recover our longlived assets which may result in an impairment charge being recorded in the future we recognized an insignificant amount of impairment in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” requires at least an annual assessment for impairment of goodwill by applying a fairvaluebased test a twostep approach is required to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit the first step tests for impairment by applying fair valuebased tests at the reporting unit level the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology which requires significant judgment to estimate the future cash flows determine the appropriate discount rates growth rates and other assumptions the determination of fair value for each reporting unit could be materially affected by changes in these estimates and assumptions which could trigger impairment in fiscal 2007 we completed the first step of the annual goodwill impairment testing as of january 1 2007 and found no indicators of impairment of our recorded goodwill we did not recognize an impairment loss on goodwill in fiscal 2007 2006 or 2005 future impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings and there is a potential for a writedown of goodwill in connection with the annual impairment test 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

on april 1 2006 we adopted sfas no 123r and applied the provisions of sab no 107 “ sharebased payment ” on our adoption of sfas no 123r sfas no 123r requires that the cost resulting from all sharebased payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements using a fairvaluebased method we elected to use the modified prospective transition method of adoption sfas no 123r requires us to measure compensation cost for all outstanding unvested stockbased awards made to our employees and directors based on estimated fair values and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest we recognized 133 million of stockbased compensation related to employee stock options restricted stock units restricted stock awards and our employee stock purchase plan “espp” during the fiscal year ended march 31 2007 we recognized 3 million of stockbased compensation related to employee restricted stock units stock options assumed in connection with our acquisition of jamdat and nonemployee stock options during the fiscal year ended march 31 2006 we recognized 6 million of stockbased compensation related to stock options assumed in connection with our acquisition of criterion software group ltd and nonemployee stock options and warrants during the fiscal year ended march 31 2005 

 

for options and espp we use the blackscholes option valuation model to determine the grant date fair value the blackscholes option valuation model requires us to make certain assumptions about the future the determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding subjective and complex variables such as expected employee exercise behavior and our expected stock price volatility over the term of the award generally our assumptions are based on historical information and judgment is required to determine if historical trends may be indicators of future outcomes we estimated the following key assumptions for the blackscholes valuation calculation 

 

  

as required by sfas no 123r employee stockbased compensation expense recognized in fiscal 2007 was calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures forfeitures are revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates and an adjustment will be recognized at that time 

 

changes to our underlying stock price our assumptions used in the blackscholes option valuation calculation and our forfeiture rate as well as future grants of equity could significantly impact compensation expense to be recognized in fiscal 2008 and future periods 

 

income taxes 

 

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction where we operate these estimates involve complex issues require extended periods of time to resolve and require us to make judgments such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities we are also required to make determinations of the need to record deferred tax liabilities and the recoverability of deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is 

established to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction 

 

in addition changes in our business including acquisitions changes in our international corporate structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix and amount of income as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities valuation allowances applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate as with fiscal 2007 we expect our effective tax rate to be unusually volatile and subject to significant fluctuation 

 

results of operations 

 

our fiscal year is reported on a 52 or 53week period that historically ended on the final saturday of march in each year beginning with the fiscal year ended march 31 2006 our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest march 31 as a result fiscal 2006 contained 53 weeks with the first quarter containing 14 weeks our results of operations for the fiscal years ended march 31 2008 2007 2006 and 2005 contain the following number of weeks 

 

 

 

for simplicity of disclosure all fiscal periods are referred to as ending on a calendar month end 

 

beginning in fiscal 2007 we adopted sfas no 123r and applied the provisions of sab no 107 to our adoption of sfas no 123r we elected to use the modified prospective transition method of adoption which requires that compensation expense be recognized in the financial statements for all awards granted after the date of adoption as well as for existing awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered as of the date of adoption accordingly prior periods are not restated for the effect of sfas no 123r prior to our adoption of sfas no 123r we valued our stock options based on the multipleaward valuation method and recognized the expense using the accelerated approach over the requisite service period in conjunction with our adoption of sfas no 123r we changed our method of recognizing our stockbased compensation expense to the straightline approach over the requisite service period however we continue to value our stock options based on the multipleaward valuation method 

 

prior to fiscal 2007 we accounted for stockbased awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board no 25 “ accounting for stock issued to employees ” and adopted the disclosureonly provisions of sfas no 123 “ accounting for stockbased compensation ” as amended also as required by sfas no 148 “ accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure ” we provided pro forma net income and net income per common share disclosures for stockbased awards as if the fairvaluebased method defined in sfas no 123 had been applied as a result prior periods are not restated for the effect of sfas no 123r pretax stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal years ended march 31 2007 2006 and 2005 was 133 million 3 million and 6 million respectively 

 

comparison of fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2006 

 

net revenue 

 

we derive net revenue principally from sales of interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation 2 playstation 3 xbox 360 and wii pcs and handheld game players such as the sony psp nintendo ds and nintendo game boy advance and cellular handsets we also derive net revenue from selling services in connection with some of our online games programming thirdparty web 

sites with our game content allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products and selling advertisements on our online web pages and in our games 

 

from a geographical perspective our total net revenue for fiscal years ended march 31 2007 and 2006 was as follows in millions 

 

 

 

north america 

 

for fiscal 2007 net revenue in north america was 1666 million driven primarily by 1 our packaged goods business led by sales of madden nfl 07  need for speed carbon  and ncaa football 07  and 2 to a lesser extent growth in our cellular handset games business resulting from our february 2006 acquisition of jamdat overall net revenue increased 82 million or 5 percent as compared to fiscal 2006 

 

the increase in net revenue for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was driven primarily by 1 a 95 million increase in cellular handset net revenue and 2 a 43 million increase in catalog a net revenue these increases were partially offset by a 79 million decrease in frontline b net revenue 

 

  

  

europe 

 

for fiscal 2007 net revenue in europe was 1261 million driven primarily by sales of fifa 07 and need for speed carbon overall net revenue increased 87 million or 7 percent as compared to fiscal 2006 we estimate that foreign exchange rates primarily the euro and the british pound sterling increased reported european net revenue by approximately 57 million or 5 percent for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates we estimate that european net revenue increased by approximately 30 million or 2 percent for fiscal 2007 

 

the increase in net revenue for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was driven primarily by 1 a 64 million increase in catalog net revenue and 2 a 25 million increase in cellular handset net revenue these increases were partially offset by a 7 million decrease in frontline net revenue

we expect sales of games for cellular handsets to continue to be an increasingly important part of our business worldwide

in fiscal 2007 cost of goods sold decreased by 08 percentage points as a percentage of total net revenue as compared to fiscal 2006 this decrease was primarily due to lower average product costs as a percentage of total net revenue primarily driven by 1 fewer returns and lower pricing actions taken or expected to be taken in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 and 2 improved inventory management as a result we estimate average product costs as a percentage of total net revenue decreased by approximately 2 percent in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 

 

as a percentage of total net revenue the decrease in average product costs was partially offset by an estimated 1 percent increase in license royalties during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to 1 license agreements associated with our ea sports titles and 2 from our acquisition of jamdat this was partially offset by lower license royalties from moviebased titles in fiscal 2007 

 

although there can be no assurance and our actual results could differ materially in the shortterm we expect our gross margin to decline as a result of 1 increased deferred net revenue related to certain onlineenabled packaged goods we will expense the cost of goods sold related to these transactions when delivered 2 a higher mix of copublishing and distribution net revenue that has a lower gross margin and 3 higher license royalty rates

income taxes 

 

income taxes for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 were as follows in millions 

 

 

 

our effective income tax rates were 482 percent and 376 percent for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 respectively for fiscal 2007 our effective income tax rate was higher than the us statutory rate of 350 percent due to a number of factors including certain nondeductible stock based compensation expenses related to sfas no 123r and additional charges resulting from certain nondeductible acquisitionrelated costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 for fiscal 2006 our effective income tax rate is higher than the us statutory rate of 350 percent for fiscal 2006 due to a number of factors including the repatriation of foreign earnings in connection with the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “jobs act” as discussed below and additional charges resulting from certain nondeductible acquisitionrelated costs during the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006 which were partially offset by other items 

 

our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2008 and future periods will depend on a variety of factors for example changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions for example the acquisition of and intercompany transactions related to mythic and dice changes in our international structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix of income as well as changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities valuation allowances applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters also variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate for future fiscal years we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our consolidated income or increase in consolidated loss as a result in absolute dollar terms our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pretax income than higher levels in addition at lower levels of pretax income our effective tax rate will be more volatile 

 

we historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no us taxes have been provided thereon with the exception of taking advantage of the onetime opportunity afforded to us by the jobs act we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 

 

in july 2006 fasb issued fin no 48 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 fin no 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition under fin no 48 the evaluation of a tax position is a twostep process the first step is a recognition process where we are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold it is presumed that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information the second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements fin no 48 also requires new tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning and end of the reporting period the provisions of fin no 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 as such we are required to adopt it in our first quarter of fiscal year 2008 any changes to our income taxes due to the adoption of fin no 48 are treated as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle we are evaluating what impact the adoption of fin no 48 will have on our consolidated financial statements this impact could be material and our future effective tax rates could be more volatile 

 

net income 

 

net income for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 was as follows in millions 

 

 

 

net income decreased by 160 million or 68 percent in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 the decrease was due to a 395 million increase in our operating expenses primarily due to 1 an increase of 128 million in stockbased compensation expense recognized as a result of our adoption of sfas no 123r 2 an 83 million increase in our annual bonus expense and 3 a 75 million increase in additional personnelrelated costs due to an increase in headcount related in part to our acquisitions and growth in our ea mobile business these increases in operating expenses were mitigated by 1 a 140 million increase in net revenue and 2 an 81 million decrease in our income tax provision 

 

we expect net earnings to decrease in fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of 1 the fact that during fiscal 2008 we expect to recognize the cost of goods sold and direct marketing and selling costs related to certain onlineenabled packaged goods for which a portion of the corresponding net revenue will be deferred and not recognized until fiscal 2009 and 2 an increase in our research and development expense

from a title and franchise perspective the decrease in net revenue was primarily due to 1 lower sales from our nfl street nba street def jam and the urbz tm franchises as there were no corresponding titles released during fiscal 2006 and 2 lower sales from our lord of the rings franchise which was released on multiple platforms during fiscal 2005 as compared to two platforms the psp and pc during fiscal 2006 the overall decrease in net revenue was mitigated by 1 sales of battlefield 2 tm on the pc which was released during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and battlefield 2 modern combat tm on the playstation 2 and xbox released during the third quarter of fiscal 2006 2 increased net revenue from our madden franchise primarily resulting from the release of madden nfl 06 on the xbox 360 and psp in fiscal 2006 and 3 increased net revenue from our burnout franchise primarily resulting from the release of burnout tm revenge on the xbox 360 and burnout tm legends on the psp in fiscal 2006

impact of recently issued accounting standards 

 

in february 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 155 “accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments — an amendment of fasb statements no 133 and 140”  sfas no 155 1 permits fair value measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation 2 clarifies that interestonly strips and principalonly strips are not subject to the requirements of sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities”  3 establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation 4 clarifies that 

concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives and 5 amends sfas no 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities — a replacement of fasb statement no 125” to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying specialpurpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument in december 2006 the fasb cleared guidance in derivatives implementation group statement 133 implementation issue no b40 “embedded derivatives application of paragraph 13b to securitized interests in prepayable financial assets”  fasb concluded that a securitized interest in prepayable financial assets is not subject to the conditions in paragraph 13b of sfas no 133 if it meets the two criteria outlined in the statement 133 implementation issue no b40 sfas no 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2006 the guidance in the statement 133 implementation issue no b40 is applicable upon adoption of sfas no 155 although the fasb provides certain exceptions as described in the statement 133 implementation issue no b40 we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 155 or statement 133 implementation issue no b40 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in july 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation “fin” no 48 “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 ” fin no 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 “ accounting for income taxes ” fin no 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition under fin no 48 the evaluation of a tax position is a twostep process the first step is a recognition process where we are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold it is presumed that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information the second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements fin no 48 also requires new tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning and end of the reporting period the provisions of fin no 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 as such we are required to adopt it in our first quarter of fiscal year 2008 any changes to our income taxes due to the adoption of fin no 48 are treated as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle we are evaluating what impact the adoption of fin no 48 will have on our consolidated financial statements this impact could be material and our future effective tax rates could be more volatile 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “ fair value measurements ” sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts sfas no 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy the provisions of sfas no 157 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 157 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “ the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment of fasb statement no 115 ” sfas no 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value it also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities the provisions of sfas no 159 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 this statement should not be applied retrospectively to fiscal years 

beginning prior to the effective date except as permitted with early adoption we are evaluating if we will adopt sfas no 159 and what impact the adoption will have on our consolidated financial statements if we adopt if we adopt sfas no 159 it may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in march 2007 the emerging issues task force “eitf” issued a tentative conclusion on eitf 0703 “ accounting for advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development ” and the fasb ratified the tentative conclusion the fasb exposed the eitf tentative conclusion for public comment the comment period was expected to end in may 2007 eitf 0703 addresses the diversity which exists with respect to the accounting for the nonrefundable portion of a payment made by a research and development entity for future research and development activities under this tentative conclusion an entity would defer and capitalize nonrefundable advance payments made for research and development activities until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed if a final consensus is reached on this tentative conclusion eitf 0703 would be effective for interim or annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2007 we do not expect the adoption of eitf 0703 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements if ratified by the fasb as currently proposed 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

  

 

changes in cash flow 

 

during fiscal 2007 we generated 397 million of cash from operating activities as compared to 596 million for fiscal 2006 the decrease in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to the timing of the collection of our receivables as a result of collecting a greater amount of our receivables during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2007 we expect cash from operating activities to increase in fiscal 2008 

 

for fiscal 2007 we generated 1315 million of cash proceeds from maturities and sales of shortterm investments and 168 million in proceeds from sales of common stock through our stockbased compensation plans our primary use of cash in nonoperating activities consisted of 1 1522 million used to purchase shortterm investments 2 178 million in capital expenditures primarily related to investments in our worldwide development tools technologies and equipment and expansions of our vancouver and united kingdom studios as well as 3 103 million primarily for the acquisitions of mythic and the remaining minority interest in dice during fiscal 2008 we anticipate making continued capital investments in our studios investments in the new generation of consoles online infrastructure and mobile platforms in addition

shortterm investments and marketable equity securities 

 

due to our mix of fixed and variable rate securities our shortterm investment portfolio is susceptible to changes in shortterm interest rates as of march 31 2007 our shortterm investments had gross unrealized gains of 2 million or less than 1 percent of the total in shortterm investments and gross unrealized losses of approximately 1 million or less than 1 percent of the total in shortterm investments from time to time we may liquidate some or all of our shortterm investments to fund operational needs or other activities such as capital expenditures business acquisitions or stock repurchase programs depending on which shortterm investments we liquidate to fund these activities we could recognize a portion or all of the gross unrealized gains or losses 

 

marketable equity securities increased to 341 million as of march 31 2007 from 160 million as of march 31 2006 due to an increase in the fair value of our investment in ubisoft entertainment 

 

receivables net 

 

our gross accounts receivable balances were 470 million and 431 million as of march 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in our accounts receivable balance was primarily due to a higher percentage of net revenue recognized in the last month of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 reserves for sales returns pricing allowances and doubtful accounts decreased in absolute dollars from 232 million as of march 31 2006 to 214 million as of march 31 2007 as a percentage of trailing nine month net revenue reserves decreased from 9 percent as of march 31 2006 to 8 percent as of march 31 2007 we believe these reserves are adequate based on historical experience and our current estimate of potential returns pricing allowances and doubtful accounts

other current assets 

 

other current assets decreased to 219 million as of march 31 2007 from 234 million as of march 31 2006 primarily due to the timing of the collection of advertising credits owed to us by our vendors that were earned in fiscal 2007 partially offset by an increase in value added taxes receivable 

 

accounts payable 

 

accounts payable increased to 180 million as of march 31 2007 from 163 million as of march 31 2006 primarily due to higher inventory purchases to support our business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 

 

accrued and other current liabilities 

 

our accrued and other liabilities increased to 823 million as of march 31 2007 from 697 million as of march 31 2006 the increase was primarily due to an increase of 1 84 million in accrued compensation and benefits and 2 50 million in income taxes payable 

 

deferred income taxes net 

 

our longterm position of deferred income taxes changed by 46 million from a liability position as of march 31 2006 to a net asset position as of march 31 2007 primarily due to the addition of assets related to our adoption of sfas no 123r and the reduction of liabilities due to the amortization of purchased intangibles 

 

financial condition 

 

we believe that existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments marketable equity securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months including working capital requirements capital expenditures and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position facilitate expansion pursue strategic acquisitions and investments or to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise there can be no assurance however that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms if at all or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders

market risk 

 

we are exposed to various market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market prices market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks foreign exchange option and forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below we have not historically nor do we currently hedge our shortterm investment portfolio we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be exposed to significant interest rate risk because our cash and cash equivalent portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report we also do not currently hedge our market price risk relating to our equity investments further we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report

cash flow hedging activities from time to time we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreigncurrencydenominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing option contracts that generally have maturities of 15 months or less these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges the derivative assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive 

income in stockholders’ equity and subsequently reclassified into net revenue or operating expenses as appropriate in the period when the forecasted transaction is recorded the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value if any is reported in each period in interest and other income net in our consolidated statements of operations our hedging programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements in revenue and operating expenses as of march 31 2007 we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately 28 million in foreign currencies and to sell approximately 72 million of foreign currencies as of march 31 2007 these foreign currency option contracts outstanding had a total fair value of less than 1 million included in other current assets as of march 31 2006 we had no foreign currency option contracts outstanding 

 

balance sheet hedging activities we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreigncurrencydenominated assets and liabilities primarily intercompany receivables and payables the forward contracts generally have a contractual term of approximately one month and are transacted near monthend therefore the fair value of the forward contracts generally is not significant at each monthend our foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 133 and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts are reported as other current assets or other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses from changes in fair value are reported in interest and other income net the gains and losses on these forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying foreigncurrencydenominated assets and liabilities which are also reported in interest and other income net in our consolidated statements of operations as of march 31 2007 we had forward foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell approximately 104 million in foreign currencies of this amount 73 million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars 8 million to sell foreign currencies in exchange for british pound sterling and 23 million to purchase foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars as of march 31 2006 we had forward foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell approximately 161 million in foreign currencies of this amount 132 million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars 14 million to sell foreign currencies in exchange for british pound sterling and 15 million to purchase foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars the fair value of our forward contracts was immaterial as of march 31 2007 and march 31 2006 

 

the counterparties to these forward and option contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks therefore the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not considered to be material 

 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations as of march 31 2007 a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would result in a potential loss in fair value of our option contracts of 1 million in both scenarios as of march 31 2006 we had no foreign currency option contracts outstanding a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would result in potential losses on our forward contracts of 9 million and 14 million respectively as of march 31 2007 and 16 million and 23 million respectively as of march 31 2006 this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift in foreign currency exchange rates which do not always move in the same direction actual results may differ materially 

 

  

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities additionally the contractual terms of the securities do not permit the issuer to call prepay or otherwise settle the securities at prices less than the stated par value of the securities our investments are held for purposes other than trading also we do not use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio 

 

as of march 31 2007 and 2006 our shortterm investments were classified as availableforsale and consequently recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of any tax effects in 

stockholders’ equity our portfolio of shortterm investments consisted of the following investment categories summarized by fair value as of march 31 2007 and 2006 in millions 

 

 

 

notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations at any time a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value in our shortterm investment portfolio as of march 31 2007 arising from potential changes in interest rates the modeling technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps 

 

 

 

the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value in our shortterm investment portfolio as of march 31 2006 arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 

 

 

 

market price risk 

 

the value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies are subject to market price volatility as of march 31 2007 and 2006 our marketable equity securities were classified as availableforsale and consequently were recorded in our consolidated balance sheets at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of any tax effects in 

stockholders’ equity the fair value of our marketable equity securities was 341 million and 160 million as of march 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

at any time a sharp change in market prices in our investments in marketable equity securities could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investments the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value in our marketable equity securities as of march 31 2007 arising from changes in market prices plus or minus 25 percent 50 percent and 75 percent

 item 1 business 

overview 

electronic arts develops markets publishes and distributes interactive software games we sometimes refer to them as “titles” that are playable by consumers on the following devices 

 we refer to consoles pcs mobile platforms and online collectively as “platforms” 

we were initially incorporated in california in 1982 in september 1991 we reincorporated under the laws of delaware our principal executive offices are located near san francisco california at 209 redwood shores parkway redwood city california 94065 and our telephone number is 650 6281500 

we publish interactive software games for multiple platforms our products that are designed to play on consoles and certain mobile platforms are published under license from the manufacturers of these platforms for example sony for the playstation 2 and psp microsoft for the xbox and xbox 360 and nintendo for the nintendo gamecube game boy advance and nintendo ds we invest in the creation of software tools to more efficiently develop games for multiple platforms we also make investments in facilities and equipment that allow us to create and edit video and audio recordings that are used in our games since our inception we have published games for over 47 different platforms 

our product development methods and organization are modeled on those used in other sectors of the entertainment industry employees whom we call “executive producers” are responsible for overseeing the development of one or more products the interactive software games that we develop and publish are broken down into two major categories 1 products developed by our ea studios for play on consoles pcs mobile platforms and online and 2 copublishing and distribution products 

 we develop games internally at our development and production studios located near san francisco los angeles orlando chicago vancouver montreal london sweden tokyo and shanghai we also engage third parties to develop games on our behalf at their own development and production studios 

on february 15 2006 we acquired jamdat mobile inc “jamdat” based in los angeles california jamdat is a global publisher of wireless games and other wireless entertainment applications 

3 for cellular handsets subsequent to this acquisition we merged our existing mobile business with jamdat to establish our ea mobile business which is responsible for the creation marketing and distribution of interactive entertainment software playable on cellular handsets 

 we market our products under four brand names 

 

 we develop product families which we call “franchises” around many of our products for example every year we release new versions of most of our ea sports titles likewise we have been successful in developing marketing publishing and distributing sequels to several of our ea and ea sports big products we also release products called “expansion packs” for pc titles that provide additional content characters storylines settings missions for games that we have previously published for example the sims tm 2 open for business expands the characters settings and gameplay of the original the sims 2 game we consider titles that iterate sequel or spawn expansion packs to be franchise titles 

 through our ea partners business unit we team with other game development companies to assist them to develop their own interactive software games which we then publish market and distribute we refer to these types of arrangements as “copublishing” an example of a copublishing product is timesplitters future perfect tm  which was developed by free radical design a game development company located near london 

we also distribute interactive software games that are developed and published by other companies an example of one of our recent distribution products is halflife ®   2  developed and published by valve which we distribute worldwide 

method of delivery 

 the console pc and handheld games that we publish are made available to consumers on a disk usually cd dvd or universal media disc “umd” format that is packaged and typically sold in retail stores and through online stores including our own online store we refer to these as “packaged goods” products in north america and europe our largest markets these packaged goods products are sold primarily to retailers that may be mass market retailers such as walmart electronics specialty stores such as best buy or game software specialty stores such as gamestop 

 following our acquisition of jamdat in february 2006 we merged our existing cellular handset software game development and publishing business with jamdat to establish our ea mobile business through ea mobile we publish games for our customers to download onto their cellular handsets our customers typically purchase and download our games through a wireless carrier’s branded ecommerce service accessed directly from their cellular handsets which must be enabled by technologies such as brew or java these wireless carrier services include among others verizon wireless’ get it now  sprint pcs vision  cingular media and vodafone live  our customers are charged a onetime or monthly subscription fee on their cellular handset invoice for the game the wireless carriers generally retain a percentage of the fee and pay the rest to us the wireless distribution of our games eliminates traditional publishing complexities including physical production packaging shipping inventory management and return processing 

 there are three ways in which we publish games that are playable online by consumers 

 in addition online downloads are available for 1 certain pc games either from our eacom site or third party sites such as gametap and 2 microsoft’s xbox live service we are also developing digital content which we intend to sell online via microtransactions for nextgeneration consolebased games 

 we also maintain a smaller business where we license to manufacturers of products in related industries for example makers of personal computers or computer accessories rights to include certain of our products with the manufacturer’s product or offer our products to consumers who have purchased the manufacturer’s product we call these combined products “oem bundles” 

intellectual property 

like other entertainment companies our business is based on the creation acquisition exploitation and protection of intellectual property some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code patented technology and other technology and trade secrets that we use to develop our games and to make them run properly on the platforms other intellectual property is in the form of audiovisual elements that consumers can see hear and interact with when they are playing our games — we call this form of intellectual property “content” 

each of our products embodies a number of separate forms of intellectual property protection the software and the content of our products are copyrighted our products may use patented inventions or trade secrets our product brands and names may be trademarks of ours or others our products may contain voices and 

5 likenesses of actors athletes andor commentators protected by personal publicity rights and often contain musical compositions and performances that are also copyrighted our products also may contain content licensed from others such as trademarks fictional characters storylines and software code 

we acquire the rights to include these kinds of intellectual property in our products through our own development acquisitions and license agreements such as those with sports leagues and player associations movie studios and performing talent music labels music publishers and musicians these licenses are typically limited to use of the licensed rights in products for specific time periods in addition our products that play on consoles such as the sony playstation 2 and some mobile platforms include technology that is owned by the console manufacturer for example sony and licensed nonexclusively to us for use while we may have renewal rights for some licenses our business and the justification for the development of many of our products is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain the intellectual property rights from the owners of these rights at reasonable rates 

our products are susceptible to unauthorized copying we typically distribute our pc products using copy protection technology that we license from other companies in addition console manufacturers such as sony typically incorporate security devices in their consoles in an effort to prevent the use of unlicensed products our primary protection against unauthorized use duplication and distribution of our products is enforcement of our copyright and trademark interests we typically own the copyright to the software code as well as the brand or title name trademark under which our products are marketed we register our copyrights in the united states and other countries 

market segment 

historically there have been multiple consoles and mobile video game players available to consumers that play interactive software games like ours and there has been vigorous competition between manufacturers while sony’s playstation ® and playstation 2 consoles have significantly outsold their competitors in the past microsoft and nintendo are large and viable competitors and pcs continue to be a strong interactive game platform similarly while nintendo’s game boy game boy color and game boy advance have been the historic leaders in the mobile video game player market sony’s playstation portable is a recent successful competitor in this segment we develop and publish products for multiple platforms and this diversification continues to be a cornerstone of our product strategy 

we currently develop or publish products for 12 different hardware platforms in fiscal 2006 we released games designed to play on the playstation 2 xbox xbox 360 nintendo gamecube pc game boy advance sony psp nintendo ds online and cellular handsets in fiscal 2007 we plan to release games designed for play on these platforms as well as games designed for play on the playstation 3 and nintendo wii tm  

 the latest generation of video game consoles was initiated by the launch of microsoft’s xbox 360 in fiscal 2006 and will continue with the launches of the upcoming sony and nintendo consoles the following table details select information on some of the console platforms for which we have published titles 

 playstation 2 sony released the playstation 2 console in japan in march 2000 in north america in october 2000 and in europe in november 2000 the playstation 2 console is a dvdbased system that with a network adaptor is internet ready as well as backward compatible with games published for its predecessor the playstation we have published and are currently developing numerous products for the sony playstation 2 

nintendo gamecube nintendo launched the nintendo gamecube console in japan in september 2001 in north america in november 2001 and in europe in may 2002 the nintendo gamecube plays games that are manufactured on a proprietary optical disk we have published and are currently developing several products for the nintendo gamecube 

xbox microsoft launched the xbox console in north america in november 2001 in japan in february 2002 and in europe in march 2002 the microsoft xbox is dvdbased system that is internet ready in may 2004 we began to support the xbox live service with features including quickmatch optimatch gamertags xbox live friends list voice communication and ea messenger service we have published and are currently developing numerous products for the microsoft xbox 

xbox 360 microsoft launched the xbox 360 console in north america in november 2005 and in europe and japan in december 2005 the xbox 360 is a dvdbased system that is internet and high definition ready we have published several titles and are currently developing numerous products for the xbox 360 all of which also support the xbox live service in addition we are developing digital content for sale via microtransactions on the xbox live service 

 our industry is cyclical and is in the transition stage to the next cycle microsoft launched the xbox 360 at the end of calendar year 2005 in the coming months we expect sony and nintendo to introduce new video game consoles as well these nextgeneration consoles have and are expected to introduce new complexities both the xbox 360 and the playstation 3 have a complex multiprocessor architecture and highdefinition video outputs the nintendo wii will introduce a unique controller 

 the following table details select information on some of the handheld video game players for which we have published titles 

 nintendo ds nintendo launched the nintendo ds in north america in november 2004 in japan in december 2004 and in europe in march 2005 we have published several products and are currently developing several more products for the nintendo ds 

sony psp sony launched the psp in japan in december 2004 in north america in march 2005 and in europe in september 2005 the sony psp is a umdbased system we have published are currently developing and expect to develop numerous products for the sony psp 

cellular handsets following our acquisition of jamdat in february 2006 we merged our existing cellular handset software game development and publishing business with jamdat to establish our ea mobile business through ea mobile we are a leading global publisher of interactive entertainment software playable on cellular handsets which include games ringtones images and other content in north america we are the leading publisher of interactive entertainment software playable on cellular handsets 

many of our games are designed to take advantage of multimedia enhancements in the latest generation of cellular handsets including highresolution color displays increased processing power improved audio capabilities and increased memory capabilities we publish games in multiple categories designed to appeal to a broad range of wireless subscribers our portfolio is primarily based on intellectual properties that we create and own and wellestablished brands and content that we license from third parties 

 there are three types of eapublished games that are played online by consumers 1 online casual games marketed under the pogo brand available to consumers on our web site wwwpogocom and on certain online services provided by america online inc 2 massively multiplayer online games sold to consumers in the form of a cd dvd or download containing the software necessary to play the game and 3 onlineenabled packaged goods in which certain of our pc playstation 2 psp and xbox products allow consumers to participate in online communities and play against one another via the internet 

we believe that online gaming is integral to our existing and future products however the continued growth of the online sector in our industry will depend on the following key factors 

 8 competition 

we compete in the entertainment industry at the most fundamental level our products compete with other forms of entertainment such as motion pictures television and music for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers we believe that the software games segment is best viewed as a segment of the overall entertainment market we believe that large software companies and media companies are increasing their focus on the software games segment of the entertainment market and as a result may compete directly with us several large software companies and media companies eg microsoft and sony have been publishing products that compete with ours for a long time and other diversified mediaentertainment companies eg time warner viacom fox and disney are expanding their software game publishing efforts 

the software games business is highly competitive it is characterized by the continuous introduction of new titles and the development of new technologies our competitors vary in size and cost structure from very small companies with limited resources to very large diversified corporations with greater financial and marketing resources than ours our business is driven by hit titles which require everincreasing budgets for development and marketing as a result the availability of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in developing and marketing software games competition is also based on product quality and features timing of product releases brandname recognition quality of ingame content access to distribution channels effectiveness of marketing and price 

 we currently compete with sony microsoft and nintendo each of which develop and publish software for their respective console platforms we also compete with numerous companies which are like us licensed by the console manufacturers to develop and publish software games that operate on their consoles these competitors include activision atari capcom koei konami lucasarts midway namco sega taketwo interactive thq ubisoft and vivendi universal games among others as discussed above diversified media companies such as time warner viacom fox and disney are also expanding their software game publishing efforts 

in addition to competing for product sales we face heavy competition from other software game companies to obtain license agreements granting us the right to use intellectual property included in our products some of these content licenses are controlled by the diversified media companies which in some cases have decided to publish their own games based on popular movie properties that they control rather than licensing the content to a software game company such as us 

the market for our products is also characterized by significant price competition and we regularly face pricing pressures from our competitors these pressures have from time to time required us to reduce our prices on certain products our experience has been that software game prices tend to decline once a generation of consoles has been in the market for a significant period of time due to the increasing number of software titles competing for acceptance by consumers and the anticipation of the nextgeneration of consoles we have experienced this kind of price erosion during the past twelve months as the software game segment has been going through a transition from the current generation of consoles playstation 2 xbox and nintendo gamecube to the next generation of consoles xbox 360 playstation 3 and nintendo wii 

 the wireless entertainment applications market segment for which we develop and publish games ringtones and wallpapers for cellular handsets is highly competitive and characterized by frequent product introductions evolving wireless platforms and new technologies as demand for applications continues to increase we expect new competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources to develop and market applications as a result we expect competition in the wireless entertainment market segment to intensify 

9 the current and potential competition in the wireless entertainment applications market segment includes major media companies traditional video game publishing companies wireless carriers wireless software providers and other companies that specialize in wireless entertainment applications we also compete with wireless content aggregators who pool applications from multiple developers and sometimes publishers and offer them to carriers or through other sales channels 

currently we consider our primary competitors in the wireless entertainment applications market segment to be disney gameloft infospace mforma namco sony pictures sorrent thq wireless verisign and yahoo 

 the online games market segment is also highly competitive and characterized by frequent product introductions new business models and new platforms as the proportion of households with broadband connections increases we expect new competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources to develop online games as a result we expect competition in the online games market segment to intensify 

our current and potential competitors in the online game market segment include major media companies traditional video game publishing companies and companies that specialize in online games our competitors in the casual games market segment include yahoo popcap real and msn in the massively multiplayer online game market segment our competitors include vivendi games nc soft sony and atari

 many of our products are based on or incorporate content and trademarks owned by others for example our ea sports and ea sports big products include rights licensed from the major sports leagues and players associations similarly many of our hit ea franchises such as the godfather harry potter and lord of the rings are based on key film and literary licenses celebrities and organizations with whom we have contracts include fifa fifpro foundation and uefa professional soccer nascar and isc stock car racing national basketball association professional basketball pga tour tiger woods and pebble beach professional golf national hockey league and nhlpa professional hockey warner bros harry potter batman and superman new line productions and saul zaentz company the lord of the rings marvel enterprises fighting national football league properties arena football league and players inc professional football collegiate licensing company collegiate football basketball and baseball simcoh def jam viacom consumer products the godfather valve corporation halflife and counterstrike espn content in ea sports games twentieth century fox licensing and merchandising the simpsons lamborghini mclaren and porsche car licenses for need for speed  and mobile game rights with popcap games and the tetris company in the future we will likely enter into other relationships with other significant content providers

the products produced by ea’s studios are designed and created by our employee designers and artists and by nonemployee software developers we call them “independent artists” or “thirdparty developers” we typically advance development funds to the independent artists and thirdparty developers during development of our games these payments are considered advances against subsequent royalties based on the sales of the products these terms are typically set forth in written agreements entered into with the independent artists and thirdparty developers 

during fiscal 2006 the retail selling prices of our newly released products in north america ranged from 2999 to 5999 other titles including rereleases of older titles marketed as “classics” had retail selling prices that ranged from 999 to 2999 these ranges may not be indicative of our future retail selling prices in north america which are based on prevailing market conditions the retail selling prices of our titles outside of north america vary widely depending on factors such as local market conditions 

our goal is to maintain our position as a leading publisher of games sold for play on video game consoles pcs and mobile platforms we will continue to invest in tools and technologies designed to facilitate development of our products for current and nextgeneration consoles mobile platforms and online we have incurred and expect to incur higher costs during this transition to nextgeneration consoles during this transition we intend to continue to develop titles for currentgeneration video game consoles while we also continue to make significant investments in the development of products that operate on nextgeneration consoles such as the xbox 360 playstation 3 and nintendo wii these investments are recorded in research and development in our consolidated statement of operations we had research and development expenditures of 758 million in fiscal 2006 633 million in fiscal 2005 and 511 million in fiscal 2004 

 we publish three types of games that are played online by consumers online casual games massively multiplayer online games and onlineenabled packaged goods games 

online casual games our online casual games are marketed under three brands pogo our free online games service club pogo our subscriptionbased online games service and pogotogo downloadable games 

 12  massively multiplayer online games massively multiplayer online games are played exclusively online and are experienced as interactive virtual worlds where thousands of other players can interact with one another massively multiplayer online games are sold to consumers in the form of a cd dvd or download containing the software necessary to play the game after installing the software on their pcs players are able to logon to servers in order to interact with other players 

to date we have launched five massively multiplayer online games with mixed results while we have achieved success with ultima online our other massively multiplayer online games have not met expectations we continue to explore opportunities to build success in this segment of online games 

onlineenabled packaged goods we include online capability features in certain of our pc playstation 2 xbox xbox 360 and psp products which enable consumers to participate in online communities and play against one another via the internet in fiscal 2006 16 xbox 14 playstation 2 eight pc seven xbox 360 and four psp titles had online gameplay capability we expect to include online gameplay capability in almost all of our titles going forward 

marketing and distribution 

we market the products produced by our studios under the ea sports ea sports big ea and pogo brands products marketed under the ea sports brand typically simulate professional and collegiate sports and include franchises such as madden nfl fifa soccer and nba live products marketed under the ea sports big brand typically feature extreme sports or modified traditional sports in arcadestyle games and include such titles as fifa street 2 and nba street v3  we market nonsports games under the ea brand including franchises such as need for speed the sims and the lord of the rings as well as the godfather   tm the game  

our ea partners business unit operates under a variety of deal types and structures with the intent of generating leveraging andor owning intellectual properties conceived by other developers publishers or licensors worldwide through ea partners we provide direct development expertise to our partners via an internal production staff while also making available our publishing resources to provide sales marketing and distribution services on a global basis ea partners also provides distribution and manufacturing services to other publishers these titles are typically delivered to us from other publishers in gold master form or as completed products 

the interactive software game business is “hit” driven requiring significant expenditures for marketing and advertising of our products there can be no assurance that we will continue to produce “hit” titles or that advertising for any product will increase sales sufficiently to recoup those advertising expenses 

we generated approximately 94 percent of our north american net revenue from direct sales to retailers the remaining 6 percent of our north american sales were made through a limited number of specialized and regional distributors and rack jobbers in markets where we believe direct sales would not be economical outside of north america we derive revenue primarily from direct sales to retailers in a few of our smaller markets we sell our products through distributors with whom we have written agreements or informal arrangements depending on the business customs of the territories we had direct sales to one 

13 customer walmart stores inc which represented approximately 13 percent of total net revenue in both fiscal 2006 and 2004 and approximately 14 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2005 

in north america we have stockbalancing programs for our pc products which allow for the exchange of pc products by resellers under certain circumstances we may also decide to provide price protection for our pc products under certain circumstances in north america in most of our major geographical markets we accept product returns on our pc products and we may decide to accept product returns or provide price protection under certain circumstances for our console products after we analyze inventory remaining in the channel the rate of inventory sellthrough in the channel and our remaining inventory on hand it is our policy to exchange products or give credits rather than give cash refunds we actively monitor the volume of our sales to our channel partners and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods 

the distribution channels through which our games are sold have been characterized by change including consolidations and financial difficulties of certain distributors and retailers the bankruptcy or other business difficulties of a distributor or retailer could render our accounts receivable from such entity uncollectible which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition in addition an increasing number of companies are competing for access to our distribution channels our arrangements with our distributors and retailers may be terminated by either party at any time without cause distributors and retailers often carry products that compete with ours retailers of our products typically have a limited amount of shelf space and promotional resources that they are willing to devote to the software games category and there is intense competition for these resources there can be no assurance that distributors and retailers will continue to purchase our products or provide our products with adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support 

inventory and working capital 

we manage inventories by communicating with our customers prior to the release of our products and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct and territorybyterritory basis historically we have experienced high turnover of our products and the lead times on reorders of our products are generally short approximately two to three weeks further as discussed in “marketing and distribution” and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we have practices in place with our customers such as stock balancing and price protection that reduce product returns 

international operations 

we conduct business and have whollyowned subsidiaries throughout the world including offices in australia austria barbados belgium bermuda brazil canada china the czech republic denmark england finland france germany greece hong kong hungary india italy japan mexico the netherlands new zealand norway poland portugal romania singapore south africa south korea spain sweden switzerland taiwan and thailand international net revenue decreased by 7 percent to 1367 billion or 46 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2006 compared to 1464 billion or 47 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2005 our decrease in international net revenue was primarily driven by lower sales in europe and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates 

we believe that in order to increase our online sales in asia we will need to devote significant resources to hire local development talent and expand our infrastructure most notably the expansion and creation of studio facilities to develop content locally in addition we are establishing online game marketing publishing and distribution functions in china as part of this strategy we may seek to partner with established local companies through acquisitions joint ventures or other similar arrangements 

the amounts of net revenue and longlived assets attributable to each of our geographic regions for each of the last three fiscal years are set forth in note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

14 manufacturing and suppliers 

the suppliers we use to manufacture our packaged goods games can be characterized in three types 

 our online games and cellular handset applications are delivered digitally and therefore are not manufactured 

in many instances we are able to acquire materials on a volumediscount basis we have multiple potential sources of supply for most materials except for the disk component of our playstation 2 psp and nintendo gamecube disk products as well as nintendo ds cartridges as discussed in “significant relationships” we also have alternate sources for the manufacture and assembly of most of our products to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in production of our software and related documentation and packaging however a shortage of components manufacturing delays by sony nintendo or other vendors or other factors beyond our control could impair our ability to manufacture or have manufactured our products 

backlog 

we typically ship orders immediately upon receipt to the extent that any backlog may or may not exist at the end of a reporting period it would be both coincidental and an unreliable indicator of future results of any period 

seasonality 

our business is highly seasonal we typically experience our highest revenue and profit in the holiday season quarter ending in december and a seasonal low in revenue and profit in the quarter ending in june our results however can vary based on title release dates consumer demand for our products and shipment schedules among other factors 

employees 

as of march 31 2006 we employed approximately 7200 people of whom over 4000 were outside the united states we believe that our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is a critical factor in the successful development of our products and that our future success will depend in large measure on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees to date we have been successful in recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified personnel to conduct our business successfully we believe that our relationships with our employees are strong less than three percent of our employees all of whom work for our swedish development subsidiary are represented by a union guild or other collective bargaining organization

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs our business and financial performance could be harmed our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may harm our business and financial performance 

our business is highly dependent on the success timely release and availability of new video game platforms on the continued availability of existing video game platforms as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms 

we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play on video game platforms manufactured by third parties such as sony’s playstation 2 and microsoft’s xbox the success of our business is driven in large part by the availability of an adequate supply of currentgeneration video game platforms the timely release adequate supply and success of new video game hardware systems our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be most successful in the marketplace and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of a new platform a new platform for which we are developing products may be delayed may not succeed or may have a shorter life cycle than anticipated if the platforms for which we are developing products are not released when anticipated are not available in adequate amounts to meet consumer demand or do not attain wide 

18 market acceptance our revenue will suffer we may be unable to fully recover the resources we have committed and our financial performance will be harmed 

our industry is cyclical and is in the midst of a transition period heading into the next cycle during the transition we expect our costs to continue to increase we may experience a decline in sales as consumers anticipate and adopt nextgeneration products and our operating results may suffer and become more difficult to predict 

video game platforms have historically had a life cycle of four to six years which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well sony’s playstation 2 was introduced in 2000 and microsoft’s xbox and the nintendo gamecube were introduced in 2001 microsoft released the xbox 360 in november 2005 and we expect sony and nintendo to introduce new video game players into the market as well socalled “nextgeneration platforms” in the coming months as a result we believe that the interactive entertainment industry is in the midst of a transition stage leading into the next cycle during this transition we intend to continue developing and marketing new titles for currentgeneration video game platforms while we also make significant investments developing products for the nextgeneration platforms we have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased costs during the transition to nextgeneration platforms which are not likely to be offset in the near future moreover we expect development costs for nextgeneration video games to be greater on a pertitle basis than development costs for currentgeneration video games 

we also expect that as the current generation of platforms reaches the end of its cycle and nextgeneration platforms are introduced into the market sales of video games for currentgeneration platforms will continue to decline as consumers replace their currentgeneration platforms with nextgeneration platforms or defer game software purchases until they are able to purchase a nextgeneration platform this decline in currentgeneration product sales may not be offset by increased sales of products for the new platforms for example following the launch of sony’s playstation 2 platform we experienced a significant decline in revenue from sales of products for sony’s older playstation game console which was not immediately offset by revenue generated from sales of products for the playstation 2 more recently we have seen a sharp decrease in sales of titles for the xbox following the launch of the xbox 360 in addition during the transition we expect our operating results to be more volatile and difficult to predict which could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly 

we expect the average price of currentgeneration titles to continue to decline 

as a result of the transition to nextgeneration platforms a more valueoriented consumer base a greater number of currentgeneration titles being published and significant pricing pressure from our competitors we have experienced a decrease in the average price of our titles for currentgeneration platforms as the interactive entertainment industry continues to transition to nextgeneration platforms we expect few if any currentgeneration titles will be able to command premium price points and we expect that even these titles will be subject to price reductions at an earlier point in their sales cycle than we have seen in prior years we expect the average price of currentgeneration titles to continue to decline which will have a negative effect on our margins and operating results 

our platform licensors set the royalty rates and other fees that we must pay to publish games for their platforms and therefore have significant influence on our costs if one or more of the platform licensors adopt a different fee structure for future game consoles or we are unable to obtain such licenses our profitability will be materially impacted 

in november 2005 microsoft released the xbox 360 and over the course of the next twelve months we expect sony and nintendo to introduce new video game players into the market in various parts of the world in order to publish products for a new video game player we must take a license from the platform licensor which gives the platform licensor the opportunity to set the fee structure that we must pay in order to publish games for that platform 

similarly certain platform licensors have retained the flexibility to change their fee structures for online gameplay and features for their consoles the control that platform licensors have over the fee structures 

19 for their future platforms and online access makes it difficult for us to predict our costs and profitability in the medium to long term it is also possible that platform licensors may choose not to renew our licenses because publishing products for video game consoles is the largest portion of our business any increase in fee structures or failure to secure a license relationship would significantly harm our ability to generate revenues andor profits 

if we do not consistently meet our product development schedules our operating results will be adversely affected 

our business is highly seasonal with the highest levels of consumer demand and a significant percentage of our revenue occurring in the december quarter in addition we seek to release many of our products in conjunction with specific events such as the release of a related movie or the beginning of a sports season or major sporting event if we miss these key selling periods for any reason including product delays or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have developed products our sales will suffer disproportionately likewise if a key event to which our product release schedule is tied were to be delayed or cancelled our sales would also suffer disproportionately our ability to meet product development schedules is affected by a number of factors including the creative processes involved the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams required by the increasing complexity of our products and the need to finetune our products prior to their release we have experienced development delays for our products in the past which caused us to push back release dates in the future any failure to meet anticipated production or release schedules would likely result in a delay of revenue or possibly a significant shortfall in our revenue harm our profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different than anticipated 

our business is subject to risks generally associated with the entertainment industry any of which could significantly harm our operating results 

our business is subject to risks that are generally associated with the entertainment industry many of which are beyond our control these risks could negatively impact our operating results and include the popularity price and timing of our games and the platforms on which they are played economic conditions that adversely affect discretionary consumer spending changes in consumer demographics the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted 

technology changes rapidly in our business and if we fail to anticipate or successfully implement new technologies or the manner in which people play our games the quality timeliness and competitiveness of our products and services will suffer 

rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate sometimes years in advance which technologies we must implement and take advantage of in order to make our products and services competitive in the market therefore we usually start our product development with a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve we may not be able to achieve these goals or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly and effectively than we can in either case our products and services may be technologically inferior to our competitors’ less appealing to consumers or both if we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule of our products and services then we may delay their release until these technology goals can be achieved which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses alternatively we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies either to preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up with our competition which would increase our development expenses 

our business is intensely competitive and “hit” driven if we do not continue to deliver “hit” products and services or if consumers prefer our competitors’ products or services over our own our operating results could suffer 

competition in our industry is intense and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge in the united states and abroad while many new products and services are regularly introduced only a relatively small 

20 number of “hit” titles accounts for a significant portion of total revenue in our industry hit products or services offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause revenue generated from our products and services to fall below expectations if our competitors develop more successful products or services offer competitive products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering a better value proposition such as payforplay or subscriptionbased models or if we do not continue to develop consistently highquality and wellreceived products and services our revenue margins and profitability will decline 

if we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to intellectual property we will publish fewer hit titles and our revenue profitability and cash flows will decline competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs 

many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our ea sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players’ associations similarly many of our other hit franchises such as the godfather harry potter and lord of the rings are based on key film and literary licenses competition for these licenses is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses or obtain additional licenses with significant commercial value our revenues and profitability will decline significantly competition for these licenses may also drive up the advances guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor which could significantly increase our costs 

if patent claims continue to be asserted against us we may be unable to sustain our current business models or profits or we may be precluded from pursuing new business opportunities in the future 

many patents have been issued that may apply to widelyused game technologies or to potential new modes of delivering playing or monetizing game software products for example infringement claims under many issued patents are now being asserted against interactive software or online game sites several such claims have been asserted against us we incur substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims regardless of the merits of the claims in the event that there is a determination that we have infringed a thirdparty patent we could incur significant monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future which could negatively impact our operating results we may also discover that future opportunities to provide new and innovative modes of game play and game delivery to consumers may be precluded by existing patents that we are unable to license on reasonable terms 

other intellectual property claims may increase our product costs or require us to cease selling affected products 

many of our products include extremely realistic graphical images and we expect that as technology continues to advance images will become even more realistic some of the images and other content are based on realworld examples that may inadvertently infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement from time to time we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims existing or future infringement claims against us whether valid or not may be time consuming and expensive to defend such claims or litigations could require us to stop selling the affected products redesign those products to avoid infringement or obtain a license all of which would be costly and harm our business 

from time to time we may become involved in other litigation which could adversely affect us 

we are currently and from time to time in the future may become subject to other claims and litigation which could be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations in addition the outcome of any claims or litigation may be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for further information regarding certain claims and litigation in which we are currently involved see “part i — item 3 legal proceedings” below 

21 our business our products and our distribution are subject to increasing regulation of content consumer privacy distribution and online hosting and delivery in the key territories in which we conduct business if we do not successfully respond to these regulations our business may suffer 

legislation is continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution for example data protection laws in the united states and europe impose various restrictions on our web sites those rules vary by territory although the internet recognizes no geographical boundaries other countries such as germany have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged games and those transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current united states laws in the united states the federal and several state governments are continually considering content restrictions on products such as ours as well as restrictions on distribution of such products for example recent legislation has been adopted in several states and could be proposed at the federal level that prohibits the sale of certain games eg violent games or those with “m mature” or “ao adults only” ratings to minors any one or more of these factors could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers by limiting the size of the potential market for our products and by requiring additional differentiation between products for different territories to address varying regulations this additional product differentiation could be costly 

if one or more of our titles were found to contain hidden objectionable content our business could suffer 

throughout the history of our industry many video games have been designed to include certain hidden content and gameplay features that are accessible through the use of ingame cheat codes or other technological means that are intended to enhance the gameplay experience however in several cases the hidden content or feature was included in the game by an employee who was not authorized to do so or by an outside developer without the knowledge of the publisher from time to time some hidden content and features have contained profanity graphic violence and sexually explicit or otherwise objectionable material in a few cases the entertainment software ratings board “esrb” has reacted to discoveries of hidden content and features by reviewing the rating that was originally assigned to the product requiring the publisher to change the game packaging andor fining the publisher retailers have on occasion reacted to the discovery of such hidden content by removing these games from their shelves refusing to sell them and demanding that their publishers accept them as product returns likewise consumers have reacted to the revelation of hidden content by refusing to purchase such games demanding refunds for games they’ve already purchased and refraining from buying other games published by the company whose game contained the objectionable material 

we have implemented preventative measures designed to reduce the possibility of hidden objectionable content from appearing in the video games we publish nonetheless these preventative measures are subject to human error circumvention overriding and reasonable resource constraints if a video game we published were found to contain hidden objectionable content the esrb could demand that we recall a game and change its packaging to reflect a revised rating retailers could refuse to sell it and demand we accept the return of any unsold copies or returns from customers and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand that we refund their money this could have a material negative impact on our operating results and financial condition in addition our reputation could be harmed which could impact sales of other video games we sell if any of these consequences were to occur our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed 

if we ship defective products our operating results could suffer 

products such as ours are extremely complex software programs and are difficult to develop manufacture and distribute we have quality controls in place to detect defects in the software media and packaging of our products before they are released nonetheless these quality controls are subject to human error overriding and reasonable resource constraints therefore these quality controls and preventative measures may not be effective in detecting defects in our products before they have been reproduced and released into the marketplace in such an event we could be required to recall a product or we may find it 

22 necessary to voluntarily recall a product andor scrap defective inventory which could significantly harm our business and operating results 

if we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel we will be unable to effectively conduct our business in addition compensationrelated changes in accounting requirements as well as evolving legal and operational factors could have a significant impact on our expenses and operating results 

the market for technical creative marketing and other personnel essential to the development and marketing of our products and management of our businesses is extremely competitive our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of executives and key creative talent if we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need or replace key employees following their departure our ability to develop and manage our businesses will be impaired 

we annually review and evaluate with the compensation committee of our board of directors the compensation and benefits that we offer our employees to ensure that we are able to attract and retain our talent within our regular review we have considered recent changes in the accounting treatment of stock options the competitive market for technical creative marketing and other personnel and the evolving nature of job functions within our studios marketing organizations and other areas of the business any changes we make to our compensation programs could result in increased expenses and have a significant impact on our operating results 

our platform licensors are our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of andor access to our video game products if they do not approve our products we will be unable to ship to our customers 

our agreements with hardware licensors such as sony for the playstation 2 microsoft for the xbox and nintendo for the nintendo gamecube typically give significant control to the licensor over the approval and manufacturing of our products which could in certain circumstances leave us unable to get our products approved manufactured and shipped to customers these hardware licensors are also our chief competitors in most events control of the approval and manufacturing process by the platform licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently while we believe that our relationships with our hardware licensors are currently good the potential for these licensors to delay or refuse to approve or manufacture our products exists such occurrences would harm our business and our financial performance 

we also require compatibility code and the consent of microsoft and sony in order to include online capabilities in our products for their respective platforms as online capabilities for video game platforms become more significant microsoft and sony could restrict our ability to provide online capabilities for our console platform products if microsoft or sony refused to approve our products with online capabilities or significantly impacted the financial terms on which these services are offered to our customers our business could be harmed 

our international net revenue is subject to currency fluctuations 

for the fiscal year ended march 31 2006 international net revenue comprised 46 percent of our total net revenue we expect foreign sales to continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue such sales may be subject to unexpected regulatory requirements tariffs and other barriers additionally foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies which may fluctuate against the us dollar while we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate some foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities primarily certain intercompany receivables and payables and from time to time foreign currency option contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions primarily related to a portion of the revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currency generated by our operational subsidiaries our results of operations including our reported net revenue and net income and financial condition would be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations particularly the euro british pound sterling and canadian dollar 

23 changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 

we are also required to estimate what our taxes will be in the future although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the estimate process and the applicable law are inherently uncertain and our estimates are not binding on tax authorities our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in our business including the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the elections we make changes in applicable tax laws as well as other factors further our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should our ultimate tax liability exceed our estimates our income tax provision and net income could be materially affected 

we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our consolidated income as a result in absolute dollar terms our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pretax income than higher levels in addition at lower levels of pretax income our effective tax rate will be more volatile 

we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under examination by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations changes in our business or changes in applicable tax rules will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

changes in our worldwide operating structure could have adverse tax consequences 

as we expand our international operations and implement changes to our operating structure or undertake intercompany transactions in light of changing tax laws expiring rulings acquisitions and our current and anticipated business and operational requirements our tax expense could increase for example in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006 we incurred additional income taxes resulting from certain intercompany transactions 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we repatriated 375 million under the american jobs creation act of 2004 as a result we recorded an additional onetime tax expense in fiscal 2006 of 17 million 

beginning in fiscal year 2007 we will recognize expense for stockbased compensation related to our employee equity compensation and employee stock purchase programs the recognition of this expense will significantly lower our reported net income or increase our reported net loss 

on april 2 2006 the first day of our current fiscal year we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 123 revised 2004 “sfas no 123r” “sharebased payment”  which requires us to recognize compensation expense for all stockbased compensation based on estimated fair values as a result beginning with our first quarter of fiscal 2007 our operating results will contain a charge for stockbased compensation related to the equitybased compensation we provide to our employees as well as stock purchases under our 2000 employee stock purchase plan this expense will be in addition to the stockbased compensation expense we have recognized in prior periods related to restricted stock unit grants acquisitions and other grants the stockbased compensation charges we incur will depend on the number of equitybased awards we grant the number of shares of common stock we sell under our 2000 employee stock purchase plan as well as a number of estimates and variables such as estimated forfeiture rates the trading price and volatility of our common stock the expected term of our options and interest rates as a result our stockbased compensation charges can vary significantly from period to period going forward our adoption of sfas no 123r will significantly lower our reported net income 

24 or increase our reported net loss which could have an adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves 

as a result of the enactment of the sarbanesoxley act and the review of accounting policies by the sec and national and international accounting standards bodies the frequency of accounting policy changes may accelerate for example accounting policies affecting software revenue recognition have been the subject of frequent interpretations which could significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products in addition the rules for tax accounting are in the process of being changed as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue and taxes could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows it is likely that as the industry transitions to the next generation of consoles a more significant portion of our business could be generated through online services and as a result we would recognize the related revenue over an extended period of time rather than up front and all at once 

the majority of our sales are made to a relatively small number of key customers if these customers reduce their purchases of our products or become unable to pay for them our business could be harmed 

over 70 percent of our us sales were made to five key customers during the fiscal year ended march 31 2006 in europe our top ten customers accounted for approximately 32 percent of our sales in that territory during the fiscal year ended march 31 2006 worldwide we had direct sales to one customer walmart stores inc which represented approximately 13 percent of total net revenue in the fiscal year ended march 31 2006 in addition we believe it likely that had gamestop corp’s acquisition of electronics boutique holdings corp occurred on april 1 2005 the combined company would have represented greater than 10 percent of total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2006 though our products are available to consumers through a variety of retailers the concentration of our sales in one or a few large customers could lead to a shortterm disruption in our sales if one or more of these customers significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to carry our products and could make us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers became unable to pay for our products additionally our receivables from these large customers increase significantly in the december quarter as they stock up for the holiday selling season also having such a large portion of our total net revenue concentrated in a few customers reduces our negotiating leverage with these customers 

acquisitions investments and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties dilution to our investors and other negative consequences 

we have engaged in evaluated and expect to continue to engage in and evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions including i acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets and ii investments in new interactive entertainment businesses for example online and mobile games any of these strategic transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations although we regularly search for opportunities to engage in strategic transactions we may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities we may not be able to consummate potential acquisitions or investments or an acquisition or investment may not enhance our business or may decrease rather than increase our earnings in addition the process of integrating an acquired company or business or successfully exploiting acquired intellectual property or other assets could divert a significant amount of our management’s time and focus and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures additional risks we face include 

 25 

 future acquisitions and investments could involve the issuance of our equity securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased expenses any of which could harm our financial condition our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

our products are subject to the threat of piracy by a variety of organizations and individuals if we are not successful in combating and preventing piracy our sales and profitability could be harmed significantly 

in many countries around the world more pirated copies of our products are sold than legitimate copies though we believe piracy has not had a material impact on our operating results to date highly organized pirate operations have been expanding globally in addition the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures we use in our products the availability of broadband access to the internet the ability to download pirated copies of our games from various internet sites and the widespread proliferation of internet cafes using pirated copies of our products all have contributed to ongoing and expanding piracy though we take steps to make the unauthorized copying and distribution of our products more difficult as do the manufacturers of consoles on which our games are played neither our efforts nor those of the console manufacturers may be successful in controlling the piracy of our products this could have a negative effect on our growth and profitability in the future 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors above as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts’ earnings estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below the expectations of analysts and investors to factors affecting the computer software internet entertainment media or electronics industries or to national or international economic conditions

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

the following overview is a toplevel discussion of our operating results as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers is important in order to understand our results for the fiscal year ended march 31 2006 as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form 10k including in the “business” section and the “risk factors” above the remainder of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” or the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

 we develop market publish and distribute interactive software games that are playable by consumers on home video game consoles such as the sony playstation ® 2 microsoft xbox ® and xbox 360 tm  and nintendo gamecube tm  personal computers mobile platforms including cellular handsets and handheld game players such as the nintendo ds tm and the playstation ® portable “psp tm ” and online over the internet and other proprietary online networks some of our games are based on content that we license from others eg madden nfl football the godfather and fifa soccer and some of our games are based on our own whollyowned intellectual property eg the sims tm  need for speed tm and black tm  our goal is to publish titles with massmarket appeal which often means translating and localizing them for sale in nonenglish speaking countries in addition we also attempt to create software game “franchises” that allow us to publish new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the same property examples of this franchise approach are the annual iterations of our sportsbased products eg madden nfl football ncaa ® football and fifa soccer whollyowned properties that can be successfully sequeled eg the sims need for speed and battlefield and titles based on longlived literary movie properties eg lord of the rings and harry potter 

 total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2006 was 2951 billion down 6 percent as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2005 total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2006 was driven by sales of need for speed tm most wanted madden nfl 06 fifa 06 the sims tm 2  and harry potter and the goblet of fire tm  four titles sold more than five million units in the fiscal year ended march 31 2006 need for speed most wanted madden nfl 06 fifa 06 and the sims 2 

net income for the fiscal year ended march 31 2006 was 236 million as compared to 504 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2005 diluted net income per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2006 was 075 as compared to 159 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2005 

we generated 596 million in cash from operating activities during the year ended march 31 2006 as compared to generating 634 million for year ended march 31 2005 the decrease in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in our net revenue and an increase in our operating expenses primarily to support the development of nextgeneration console games this decrease was partially offset by a lower accounts receivable balance as of march 31 2006 compared to march 31 2005 resulting from a higher percentage of revenue recognized in the first two months of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 which allowed us to collect a higher percentage of our revenue during the quarter 

 transition to nextgeneration consoles our industry is cyclical and in the midst of a transition stage heading into the next cycle during the three months ended december 31 2005 microsoft launched the xbox 360 and sony and nintendo have both announced their intention to introduce new video game consoles in the coming months we expect that as the current generation of consoles continue to progress 

33 and eventually reach the end of their commercial life cycle and nextgeneration consoles are introduced into the market sales of video games for currentgeneration consoles will continue to decline as consumers replace their currentgeneration consoles with nextgeneration consoles or defer game software purchases until they are able to purchase a nextgeneration console this pattern is referred to in our industry as a transition to nextgeneration consoles during this transition we intend to continue to develop new titles for currentgeneration video game consoles while we also continue to make significant investments in the development of products for nextgeneration consoles we expect the average selling prices and the number of units of our titles for currentgeneration consoles to continue to decline as more valueoriented consumers purchase currentgeneration consoles a greater number of competitive titles are published at reduced price points and consumers defer purchases in anticipation of nextgeneration consoles we expect our gross margins to be negatively impacted by 1 a decrease in average selling prices of titles for currentgeneration platforms 2 higher license royalty rates and 3 amortization of our newlyacquired intangible assets 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur higher costs during this transition to nextgeneration consoles moreover we expect development costs for nextgeneration video games to be greater on a pertitle basis than development costs for currentgeneration video games we also expect our operating expenses to increase for the fiscal year ending march 31 2007 as compared to prior fiscal years primarily as a result of 1 the recognition of stockbased compensation due to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 123 revised 2004 “sfas no 123r” and 2 higher expenditures for research and development due to our investment in nextgeneration consoles online and mobile platforms as we move through the life cycle of currentgeneration consoles we will continue to devote significant resources to the development of currentgeneration titles while at the same time continuing to invest heavily in tools technologies and titles for the next generation of platforms and technology we expect our operating results to continue to be volatile and difficult to predict which could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly 

expansion of mobile platforms advances in mobile technology have resulted in a variety of new and evolving platforms for onthe go interactive entertainment that appeal to a broader demographic of consumers our efforts to capitalize on the growth in mobile interactive entertainment are focused in two broad areas — packaged goods games for handheld game systems and downloadable games for cellular handsets 

we have developed and published games for a variety of handheld platforms including the nintendo gameboy and gameboy advance for several years the introductions of the sony psp and the nintendo ds with their richer graphics deeper gameplay and online functionality provide a richer mobile gaming experience to consumers as a result we have seen and expect to continue to see an increase in demand for our games for handheld platforms in fiscal 2006 our net revenue from handheld platforms increased 217 percent over fiscal 2005 to 374 million 

as cellular handsets become moreandmore commonplace and wireless technology advances to include highresolution color displays increased processing power and improved audio capabilities we expect sales of games for cellular handsets to become an increasingly important part of our business worldwide to accelerate our position in this growing segment in february 2006 we acquired jamdat mobile inc “jamdat” a global publisher of wireless games and other wireless entertainment applications as a result of this acquisition in fiscal 2007 we expect our net revenue from games for cellular handsets to increase significantly from 19 million in fiscal 2006 likewise the acquisition along with the additional investment required to grow this portion of our business globally will result in increased development and operating expenses 

as mobile technology continues to evolve and the installed base of both handheld game systems and cellular phones expands we expect that sales of our titles for mobile platforms — for both handhelds and cellular handsets — will become an increasingly important part of our business 

investment in online today we generate net revenue from a variety of online products and services including casual games and downloadable content marketed under our pogo brand persistent state world 

34 games such as ultima online tm  pcbased downloadable content and onlineenabled packaged goods as the nature of online game offerings expands and evolves we anticipate longterm opportunities for growth in this business for example we expect that consumers will take advantage of the online connectivity of nextgeneration consoles at a much higher rate than they have so far on currentgeneration consoles allowing more consumers to enhance their gameplay experience through multiplayer activity communitybuilding and downloading content we also plan to increase the amount of content available for download on the pc and consoles and to enable entire pcbased games to be downloaded electronically in addition we plan to expand our casual game offerings internationally and to invest in growing genres such as advanced casual games although we intend to make significant investments in online products infrastructure and services and believe that online gameplay will become an increasingly important part of our business in the long term we do not expect revenue from persistent state world games or online gameplay and distribution to be significant in fiscal 2007 

international expansion net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately 46 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal 2006 we expect international sales to remain a fundamental part of our business we believe that in order to succeed in asia it is important to locally develop content that is specifically directed toward asian cultures and consumers as such we expect to continue to devote resources to hiring local development talent and expanding our infrastructure outside of north america most notably through the expansion and creation of local studio facilities in asia in addition we are in the process of establishing online game marketing publishing and distribution functions in china further we are planning to expand our development and publishing activities in the cellular handset games business in europe and asia as part of our international expansion strategy we may seek to partner with established local companies through acquisitions joint ventures or other similar arrangements 

sales of “hit” titles sales of “hit” titles several of which were top sellers in a number of countries contributed significantly to our net revenue our topselling titles across all platforms worldwide during the year ended march 31 2006 were need for speed most wanted madden nfl 06 fifa 06 the sims 2  and harry potter and the goblet of fire hit titles are important to our financial performance because they benefit from overall economies of scale we have developed and it is our objective to continue to develop many of our hit titles to become franchise titles that can be regularly iterated 

increasing licensing costs we generate a significant portion of our net revenue and operating income from games based on licensed content such as madden nfl football fifa soccer harry potter and espn we have recently entered into new licenses and renewed older licenses some of which contain higher royalty rates than similar license agreements we have entered into in the past we believe these licenses and the product franchises they support will continue to be important to our future operations but the higher costs of these licenses will negatively impact our gross margins 

international foreign exchange impact net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately 46 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal 2006 and approximately 47 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal 2005 our international net revenue was primarily driven by sales in europe and to a lesser extent in asia foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on our net revenue of 36 million or 1 percent for the year ended march 31 2006 as compared to the year ended march 31 2005 

acquisitions investments and strategic transactions we have engaged in evaluated and expect to continue to engage in and evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions including 1 acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets and 2 investments in new interactive entertainment businesses for example online and mobile games in fiscal 2006 we acquired jamdat as part of our efforts to accelerate our growth in mobile gaming and in fiscal 2005 we acquired criterion software group ltd “criterion” and took a controlling interest in digital illusions ce “dice” we signed an agreement to fully merge dice into ea which will allow dice to become an integrated studio the merger is expected to be completed during our fiscal quarter ending september 30 2006 

35 stockbased compensation on april 2 2006 the first day of our current fiscal year we adopted sfas no 123r “sharebased payment”  which requires us to recognize compensation expense for all stockbased compensation based on estimated fair values as a result beginning with our first quarter of fiscal 2007 our operating results will contain a charge for stockbased compensation related to the equitybased compensation we provide to our employees as well as stock purchases under our 2000 employee stock purchase plan this expense will be in addition to the stockbased compensation expense we have recognized in prior periods related to restricted stock unit grants acquisitions and other grants the stockbased compensation charges we incur will depend on the number of equitybased awards we grant the number of shares of common stock we sell under our 2000 employee stock purchase plan as well as a number of estimates and variables such as estimated forfeiture rates the trading price and volatility of our common stock the expected term of our options and interest rates as a result our stockbased compensation charges can vary significantly from period to period the expensing of stockbased compensation will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations and may not be similar to our pro forma disclosure under sfas no 123 as amended 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities contingent assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown as a result actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

 we principally derive revenue from sales of packaged interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation 2 xbox xbox 360 and nintendo gamecube pcs and mobile platforms including handheld game players such as the sony psp nintendo ds and nintendo game boy advance and cellular handsets we evaluate the recognition of revenue based on the criteria set forth in statement of position “sop” 972 “software revenue recognition”  as amended by sop 989 “modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” and staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements”  as revised by sab no 104 “revenue recognition” we evaluate revenue recognition using the following basic criteria and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met 

 determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report for 

36 example for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to 1 determine whether and when each element has been delivered 2 determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services 3 determine whether vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” exists for each undelivered element and 4 allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 

changes to any of these assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

product revenue including sales to resellers and distributors “channel partners” is recognized when the above criteria are met we reduce product revenue for estimated future returns price protection and other offerings which may occur with our customers and channel partners in certain countries we have stockbalancing programs for our pc and video game system products which allow for the exchange of these products by resellers under certain circumstances it is our general practice to exchange products or give credits rather than give cash refunds 

in certain countries from time to time we decide to provide price protection for both our pc and video game system products when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances we analyze historical returns current sellthrough of distributor and retailer inventory of our products current trends in the video game market and the overall economy changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors in addition we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods 

in the future actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms product updates or competing products for example the risk of product returns andor price protection for our products may continue to increase as the playstation 2 xbox and nintendo gamecube consoles move through their lifecycles and an increasing number and aggregate amount of competitive products heighten pricing and competitive pressures while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters these estimates are inherently subjective accordingly if our estimates changed our returns and price protection reserves would change which would impact the total net revenue we report for example if actual returns andor price protection were significantly greater than the reserves we have established our actual results would decrease our reported total net revenue conversely if actual returns andor price protection were significantly less than our reserves this would increase our reported total net revenue 

significant judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends and historical experience depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly 

 our royalty expenses consist of payments to 1 content licensors 2 independent software developers and 3 copublishing andor distribution affiliates license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities professional sports organizations movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks copyrights personal publicity rights content andor other intellectual property royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games copublishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for delivery of product 

royaltybased obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid these royaltybased obligations are generally expensed to cost of goods sold generally at the greater of the contractual rate or 

37 an effective royalty rate based on expected net product sales significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate 1 the total number of titles subject to the contract 2 the timing of the release of these titles 3 the number of software units we expect to sell and 4 future pricing determining the effective royalty rate for hitbased titles is particularly difficult due to the inherent risk of such titles accordingly if our future revenue projections change our effective royalty rates would change which could impact the royalty expense we recognize prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and copublishing affiliates are generally in connection with the development of a particular product and therefore we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product accordingly payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed as research and development as the services are incurred payments due after completion of the product primarily royaltybased in nature are generally expensed as cost of goods sold generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on expected net product sales 

our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no significant performance remains with the licensor when significant performance remains with the licensor we record royalty payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred rather than upon execution of the contract minimum royalty payment obligations are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next twelve months as of march 31 2006 and 2005 approximately 9 million and 51 million respectively of minimum guaranteed royalty obligations had been recognized 

each quarter we also evaluate the future realization of our royaltybased assets as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales any impairments determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense impairments determined postlaunch are charged to cost of goods sold in either case we rely on estimated revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties and commitments if actual sales or revised revenue estimates fall below the initial revenue estimate then the actual charge taken may be greater in any given quarter than anticipated during fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 we recorded impairment charges of 16 million 8 million and 2 million respectively 

 we evaluate both purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets in order to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in value exists this evaluation requires us to estimate among other things the remaining useful lives of the assets and future cash flows of the business these evaluations and estimates require the use of judgment our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates 

under current accounting standards we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet in order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred management makes various assumptions about the future value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash flows our future net cash flows are primarily dependent on the sale of products for play on proprietary video game consoles handheld game players pcs and cellular handsets “platforms” the success of our products is affected by our ability to accurately predict which platforms and which products we develop will be successful also our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules due to product sales shortfalls we may not realize the future net cash flows necessary to recover our longlived assets which may result in an impairment charge being recorded in the future we did not record any asset impairment charges in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 during fiscal 2004 we recognized less than 1 million of asset impairment charges 

 in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction where we operate these estimates involve complex issues require extended periods of time to resolve and require us to make judgments such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities we are also required to make determinations of the need to record deferred tax liabilities and the recoverability of deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is established to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction 

in addition changes in our business including acquisitions changes in our international structure changes in the geographic location of business functions changes in the geographic mix and amount of income as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities valuation allowances applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate and result in a variance between the projected effective tax rate for any quarter and the final effective tax rate for the fiscal year 

with respect to our projected annual effective income tax rate at the end of each quarter prior to the end of a fiscal year we are required to make a projection of several items including our projected mix of fullyear income in each jurisdiction in which we operate and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction this projection is inherently uncertain and can fluctuate throughout the fiscal year the projected annual effective income tax rate may also be adjusted for taxes related to certain anticipated changes in how we do business significant nonrecurring charges are taken in the quarter incurred the actual results could and often does vary from those projections and as such the overall effective income tax rate for a fiscal year could be different from that previously projected for the full year 

results of operations 

our fiscal year is reported on a 52 or 53week period that historically has ended on the final saturday of march in each year beginning with the fiscal year ended march 31 2006 we end our fiscal year on the saturday nearest march 31 as a result fiscal 2006 contains 53 weeks with the first quarter containing 14 weeks our results of operations for the fiscal years march 31 2007 2006 2005 and 2004 contain the following number of weeks 

 for simplicity of presentation all fiscal periods are treated as ending on a calendar month end 

comparison of fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2005 

net revenue 

we principally derive net revenue from sales of packaged interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation 2 xbox xbox 360 and nintendo gamecube pcs and mobile platforms which include handheld game players such as the sony psp nintendo ds and nintendo game boy advance and cellular handsets we also derive net revenue from selling services to some of our online games programming thirdparty web sites with our game content allowing other 

39 companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products and selling advertisements on our online web pages 

from a geographical perspective our total net revenue for the fiscal years ended march 31 2006 and 2005 was as follows in millions 

 

 for fiscal 2006 net revenue in north america was 1584 million driven primarily by sales of 1 madden nfl 06 need for speed most wanted nba live 06 ncaa ® football 06 and the sims 2 2 titles for the psp which was launched in north america in march 2005 and 3 titles for the xbox 360 which launched in november 2005 overall net revenue decreased 81 million or 5 percent as compared to fiscal 2005 as noted in the overview section above our industry is in the midst of a transition from currentgeneration to nextgeneration consoles our net revenue was adversely impacted by this transition in fiscal 2006 as overall net revenue from sales of our titles for the playstation2 xbox and nintendo gamecube decreased while sales of titles for the psp and the xbox 360 helped to mitigate the impact of the transition in fiscal 2006 they were not enough to offset the overall decrease in net revenue in north america as the transition to nextgeneration consoles continues in fiscal 2007 we expect net revenue from sales of titles for currentgeneration consoles to further decline 

from a title and franchise perspective the decrease in net revenue was primarily due to 1 lower sales from our nfl street nba street def jam and the urbz tm franchises as there were no corresponding titles released during fiscal 2006 and 2 lower sales from our lord of the rings franchise which was released on multiple platforms during fiscal 2005 as compared to two platforms the psp and pc during fiscal 2006 the overall decrease in net revenue was mitigated by 1 sales of battlefield 2 tm on the pc which was released during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and battlefield 2 modern combat tm on the playstation 2 and xbox released during the third quarter of fiscal 2006 2 increased net revenue from our madden franchise primarily resulting from the release of madden nfl 06 on the xbox 360 and psp in fiscal 2006 and 3 increased net revenue from our burnout franchise primarily resulting from the release of burnout tm revenge on the xbox 360 and burnout tm legends on the psp in fiscal 2006 

 for fiscal 2006 net revenue in europe was 1174 million driven primarily by sales of need for speed most wanted fifa 06 the sims 2 harry potter and the goblet of fire  as well as sales of titles for the psp and xbox 360 which were both introduced in europe during fiscal 2006 overall net revenue declined 110 million or 9 percent as compared to fiscal 2005 we estimate that foreign exchange rates primarily the euro and the british pound sterling decreased reported european net revenue by approximately 36 million or 3 percent net of realized gains from hedging activities for the fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates we estimate that european net revenue decreased by approximately 74 million or 6 percent for fiscal 2006 our net revenue in europe was adversely impacted by the transition to nextgeneration consoles in fiscal 2006 as overall net revenue from sales of our titles for the playstation 2 xbox and nintendo gamecube decreased sales of titles for the psp nintendo ds and the xbox 360 however were enough to offset the overall decrease in net revenue from sales of titles for currentgeneration consoles 

40 from a title and franchise perspective the overall decrease in net revenue was primarily due to 1 lower sales from our lord of the rings and the sims franchises 2 the release of the urbz tm  sims in the city tm during the three months ended december 31 2004 as there was no corresponding title released during fiscal 2006 and 3 higher fiscal 2005 sales of uefa euro 2004 tm  which was released in the three months ended june 30 2004 in conjunction with the uefa euro 2004 football tournament held in europe the overall decrease in net revenue was mitigated by increased net revenue from our battlefield franchise due to the release of multiple titles during fiscal 2006 and our fifa street franchise due to the initial release of fifa street late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 which benefited fiscal 2006 and the release of fifa street 2 earlier in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 

 for fiscal 2006 net revenue in asia increased by 13 million or 7 percent as compared to fiscal 2005 the increase in net revenue for fiscal 2006 was driven primarily by sales of titles for the psp which launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we estimate that the foreign exchange rate impact on asia net revenue was not material for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 

our total net revenue by product line for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 was as follows in millions 

 

 for fiscal 2006 net revenue from sales of titles for the playstation 2 was 1127 million driven primarily by sales of need for speed most wanted madden nfl 06 fifa 06 ncaa football 06 and nba live 06 we released 28 titles for the playstation 2 during fiscal 2006 as compared to 27 titles in fiscal 2005 overall playstation 2 net revenue decreased 203 million or 15 percent as compared to fiscal 2005 as noted above we believe the transition to nextgeneration consoles adversely impacted our net revenue from sales of titles for the playstation 2 in fiscal 2006 we expect net revenue from sales of titles for the 

41 playstation 2 to continue to decrease in fiscal 2007 as we move through the transition to nextgeneration consoles from a title and franchise perspective the decrease in net revenue was primarily due to 1 lower sales from our lord of the rings the urbz def jam nfl street and nba street franchises none of which had fiscal 2006 releases and 2 lower sales of fiscal 2006 releases from our need for speed and bond franchises as well as lower sales of our fight night franchise from which two titles were released in fiscal 2005 as compared to one title in fiscal 2006 the overall decrease in net revenue was mitigated by the releases of the godfather tm the game black tm  medal of honor european assault tm  and battlefield 2 modern combat none of which had a corresponding release in fiscal 2005 

 for fiscal 2006 net revenue from sales of titles for the xbox was 400 million driven primarily by sales of madden nfl 06 need for speed most wanted ncaa football 06 and burnout revenge we released 28 titles for the xbox during fiscal 2006 as compared to 26 titles in fiscal 2005 overall xbox net revenue decreased 116 million or 22 percent as compared to fiscal 2005 we believe the transition to nextgeneration consoles particularly the launch of the xbox 360 during the last half of fiscal 2006 adversely impacted our net revenue from sales of titles for the xbox in fiscal 2006 we expect net revenue from sales of titles for the xbox to continue to decrease in fiscal 2007 as we move through the transition and the xbox 360 installed base grows from a title and franchise perspective the decrease in net revenue was primarily due to 1 lower sales from our lord of the rings nfl street def jam nba street and the urbz franchises none of which had fiscal 2006 releases and 2 lower sales of fiscal 2006 releases from our need for speed and bond franchises as well as lower sales of our fight night franchise from which two titles were released in fiscal 2005 as compared to one title in fiscal 2006 the overall decrease in net revenue was mitigated by the release of battlefield 2 modern combat black and the godfather the game  none of which had a corresponding release in fiscal 2005 

 the xbox 360 was launched in north america europe and japan during the three months ended december 31 2005 and in the rest of asia during the three months ended march 31 2006 as of march 31 2006 the installed base of the xbox 360 continued to be small compared to the installed base of the xbox net revenue from sales of titles for the xbox 360 was 140 million for fiscal 2006 driven by sales of need for speed most wanted madden nfl 06 and ea sports tm fight night round 3 we released seven titles for the xbox 360 in fiscal 2006 we expect net revenue from sales of titles for the xbox 360 to increase in fiscal 2007 as the installed base grows and we release more titles 

 for fiscal 2006 net revenue from sales of titles for the nintendo gamecube was 135 million driven primarily by sales of need for speed most wanted harry potter and the goblet of fire and madden nfl 06 we released 14 titles for the nintendo gamecube during fiscal 2006 as compared to 20 titles in fiscal 2005 overall nintendo gamecube net revenue decreased 77 million or 36 percent as compared to fiscal 2005 consistent with the percentage decline in the number of titles we released for this platform we believe the transition to nextgeneration consoles adversely impacted our net revenue from sales of titles for the nintendo gamecube in fiscal 2006 we expect net revenue from sales of titles for the gamecube to continue to decrease in fiscal 2007 as we move through the transition to nextgeneration consoles from a title and franchise perspective the decrease in net revenue in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to 1 lower sales from our lord of the rings the urbz nba street nfl street and def jam franchises none of which had fiscal 2006 releases and 2 lower sales of fiscal 2006 releases from our need for speed and bond franchises 

 for fiscal 2006 net revenue from sales of titles for the pc was 418 million driven primarily by sales of titles from the sims franchise and battlefield 2 we released 22 titles for the pc during fiscal 2006 as 

42 compared to 21 titles in fiscal 2005 overall pc net revenue decreased 113 million or 21 percent as compared to fiscal 2005 the decrease was primarily due to 1 significantly higher fiscal 2005 sales of the sims 2 2 lower sales from our medal of honor tm franchise as there were no corresponding titles released during fiscal 2006 and 3 lower sales from our lord of the rings franchise the overall decrease in net revenue was mitigated by currentyear sales of products from our battlefield franchise on january 27 2005 we began consolidating the financial results of digital illusion ce a game development company based in sweden of which we are the majority owner into our financial statements and therefore have characterized battlefield 2 pcbased revenue as part of our pc product line prior to consolidating dice’s financial results we classified revenue from the battlefield franchise as copublishing and distribution revenue 

 net revenue from mobile products — consisting of packaged goods games for handheld systems and downloadable games for cellular handsets — increased from 118 million in fiscal 2005 to 393 million in fiscal 2006 the increase was primarily due to sales of titles released in fiscal 2006 for the psp and the nintendo ds both of which were launched in fiscal 2005 in certain countries we released 16 titles for the psp during fiscal 2006 as compared to three titles in fiscal 2005 overall psp net revenue increased 234 million driven primarily by sales of titles from our need for speed fifa burnout and madden franchises we released ten titles for the nintendo ds during fiscal 2006 as compared to three titles in fiscal 2005 nintendo ds net revenue increased 44 million driven primarily by sales of titles from our need for speed the sims and madden franchises the increase in psp and nintendo ds net revenue was partially offset by lower sales of titles for the game boy advance 

we expect mobile platform revenue to continue to increase in fiscal 2007 driven primarily by anticipated growth in our cellular handset games business 

 net revenue from copublishing and distribution products decreased from 283 million in fiscal 2005 to 213 million in fiscal 2006 the decrease was primarily due to 1 the change in our classification of sales of products from our battlefield franchise which as discussed above we no longer classify as copublishing and distribution revenue and 2 overall higher fiscal 2005 sales of various copublishing and distribution titles the overall decrease in net revenue was mitigated by sales of halflife ® 2 in fiscal 2006 

 net revenue from subscription services increased from 55 million in fiscal 2005 to 61 million in fiscal 2006 the increase in net revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of paying subscribers to club pogo tm  partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from ultima online 

 net revenue from licensing advertising and other decreased from 74 million in fiscal 2005 to 63 million in fiscal 2006 the decrease in net revenue was primarily due to nokia ngage license revenue in fiscal 2005 

cost of goods sold 

cost of goods sold for our packagedgoods business consists of 1 product costs 2 certain royalty expenses for celebrities professional sports and other organizations and independent software developers 3 manufacturing royalties net of volume discounts and other vendor reimbursements 4 expenses for defective products 5 writeoffs of postlaunch prepaid royalty costs 6 amortization of certain intangible assets and 7 operations expenses volume discounts are generally recognized upon achievement of milestones and vendor reimbursements are generally recognized as the related revenue is 

43 recognized cost of goods sold for our online products consists primarily of data center and bandwidth costs associated with hosting our web sites credit card fees and royalties for use of thirdparty properties cost of goods sold for our web site advertising business primarily consists of adserving costs 

cost of goods sold for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 were as follows in millions 

 in fiscal 2006 cost of goods sold as a percentage of total net revenue increased 18 percent from 382 percent to 400 percent as a percentage of total net revenue the increase was primarily due to an increase in our license royalties associated with new license agreements for our football titles 

we expect cost of goods sold as a percentage of total net revenue to increase during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 although there can be no assurance and our actual results could differ materially we expect gross margin pressure as a result of 1 a decrease in average selling prices of titles for currentgeneration platforms 2 higher license royalty rates and 3 amortization of our newlyacquired intangible assets 

marketing and sales 

marketing and sales expenses consist of personnelrelated costs and advertising marketing and promotional expenses net of advertising expense reimbursements from third parties 

marketing and sales expenses for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 were as follows in millions 

 marketing and sales expenses increased by 40 million or 10 percent in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 the increase was primarily due to 1 an increase of 30 million in our marketing and advertising promotional and related contracted service expenses as a result of increased advertising to support our titles and 2 an increase of 11 million in personnelrelated costs resulting from an increase in facilities and headcountrelated expenses in support of our marketing and sales functions worldwide 

marketing and sales expenses included vendor reimbursements for advertising expenses of 41 million and 42 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively 

we expect marketing and sales expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal 2007 primarily due to our adoption of sfas no 123r which will require us to expense stockbased compensation 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related expenses of executive and administrative staff fees for professional services such as legal and accounting and allowances for doubtful accounts 

general and administrative expenses for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 were as follows in millions 

 general and administrative expenses decreased by 6 million or 3 percent in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to a decrease in employeerelated costs resulting from charges taken in connection with certain employeerelated litigation matters in fiscal 2005 this decrease was partially offset by an increase in personnelrelated expenses due to an increase in headcount costs as well as an increase in professional and contracted services to support our business 

44 we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal 2007 primarily due to our adoption of sfas no 123r which will require us to expense stockbased compensation 

research and development 

research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred by our production studios for personnelrelated costs consulting equipment depreciation and any impairment of prepaid royalties for prelaunch products research and development expenses for our online business include expenses incurred by our studios consisting of direct development and related overhead costs in connection with the development and production of our online games research and development expenses also include expenses associated with the development of web site content network infrastructure direct expenses software licenses and maintenance and network and management overhead 

research and development expenses for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 were as follows in millions 

 research and development expenses increased by 125 million or 20 percent in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 the increase is primarily due to an increase of 124 million in personnelrelated costs resulting from an increase in employee headcount in our canadian and european studios as we increased our internal development efforts and invested in nextgeneration tools technologies and titles as well as consolidation of dice to a lesser extent these increases were also due to higher facilitiesrelated costs offset by lower thirdparty development costs 

we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of 1 our recognition of stockbased compensation and 2 our investment in nextgeneration consoles online and mobile platforms 

amortization of intangibles 

amortization of intangibles for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 were as follows in millions 

 for fiscal 2006 amortization of intangibles resulted from our acquisitions of jamdat criterion and others for fiscal 2005 amortization of intangibles resulted from our acquisition of criterion and others see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

we expect amortization of intangible expenses to increase in fiscal 2007 primarily due to the amortization of intangibles related to jamdat 

acquired inprocess technology 

acquired inprocess technology charges for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 were as follows in millions 

 the acquired inprocess technology charge we incurred in fiscal 2006 was primarily the result of our acquisition of jamdat the acquired inprocess technology charge we incurred in fiscal 2005 was the result of our acquisitions of criterion and a majority stake of the outstanding shares of dice acquired inprocess technology includes the value of products in the development stage that are not considered to have reached technological feasibility or have an alternative future use accordingly upon consummation of these acquisitions we incurred a charge for the acquired inprocess technology as reflected in our 

45 consolidated statement of operations see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

restructuring charges 

restructuring charges for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 were as follows in millions 

 in november 2005 we announced plans to establish an international publishing headquarters in geneva switzerland since that time and through the six months ending september 30 2006 we expect to continue to relocate certain current employees to our new facility in geneva close certain facilities in the uk and make other related changes in our international publishing business 

during fiscal 2006 restructuring charges were approximately 14 million of which 8 million was for the closure of certain uk facilities 3 million for employeerelated expenses and 3 million in other costs relating to our international publishing reorganization in fiscal 2007 we expect to incur between 15 million and 20 million of restructuring costs overall including fiscal 2006 we expect to incur between 40 million and 50 million of restructuring costs substantially all of which will result in cash expenditures by 2017 these restructuring costs will consist primarily of employeerelated relocation assistance approximately 28 million facility exit costs approximately 10 million as well as other reorganization costs approximately 8 million while we may incur severance costs paid to terminating employees in connection with the reorganization we do not expect these costs to be significant 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we aligned our resources with our product plan for fiscal 2007 and strategic opportunities with nextgeneration consoles online and mobile platforms as part of this alignment we recorded a total pretax restructuring charge of 10 million consisting entirely of onetime benefits related to headcount reductions which are included in restructuring charges in our consolidated statement of operations 

interest and other income net 

interest and other income net for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 was as follows in millions 

 for fiscal 2006 interest and other income net increased by 8 million or 14 percent as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to an increase of 31 million in interest income as a result of higher yields on our cash cash equivalent and shortterm investment balances partially offset by a net loss of 22 million in investments and foreign currency activities 

income taxes 

income taxes for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 were as follows in millions 

 our effective income tax rates were 376 percent and 305 percent for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 respectively for fiscal 2006 our effective income tax rate is higher than the us statutory rate of 350 percent for fiscal 2006 due to a number of factors including the repatriation of foreign earnings in connection with the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “jobs act” as discussed below and additional charges resulting from certain intercompany transactions during the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006 which were partially offset by other items 

46 we historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no us taxes have been provided thereon with the exception of taking advantage of the onetime opportunity afforded to us by the jobs act we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 

in july 2005 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued an exposure draft of a proposed interpretation of sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” which addresses the accounting for uncertain tax positions including subsequent updates issued by the fasb the proposed interpretation provides that the best estimate of the impact of a tax position would be recognized in an entity’s financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit based solely on its technical merits this proposed interpretation also would provide guidance on recognition and measurement balance sheet presentation disclosure accrual of interest and penalties accounting in interim periods and transition we cannot predict what actions the fasb will take or how any such actions might ultimately affect our financial position or results of operations in january 2006 the fasb announced that companies would not have to apply the proposed interpretation until fiscal years beginning after december 31 2006 an exposure draft of proposed amendments to sfas no 109 is expected in the third quarter of calendar year 2006 

our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2007 and future periods will depend on a variety of factors for example changes in our business including acquisitions and intercompany transactions changes in our international structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix of income as well as changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities valuation allowances applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate for future fiscal years we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our consolidated income as a result in absolute dollar terms our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pretax income than higher levels in addition at lower levels of pretax income our effective tax rate will be more volatile 

net income 

net income for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 was as follows in millions 

 reported net income decreased by 268 million or 53 percent in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our net revenue and growth in our operating expenses the growth in our operating expenses was primarily driven by an increase in research and development expenses as we increased our internal development efforts and invested in nextgeneration tools technologies and titles while at the same time we continued to support currentgeneration product development 

we expect our net income to decline in fiscal 2007 as a result of 1 the effect of stockbased compensation charges required by our adoption of sfas no 123r and 2 our continued support of currentgeneration product development while at the same time making significant investments in nextgeneration consoles online and mobile platforms 

47 comparison of fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2004 

net revenue

 reported net income decreased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to growth in our expenses especially research and development as we prepared for the adoption of nextgeneration technology within our industry while at the same time we continued to devote resources to the development of products for currentgeneration consoles 

 in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs — an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” sfas no 151 amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin no 43 chapter 4 “inventory pricing”  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage and requires that those items be recognized as currentperiod charges sfas no 151 also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities sfas no 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 151 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r requires that the cost resulting from all sharebased payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements using a fairvaluebased method the statement replaces sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation”  supersedes accounting principles board no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees”  and amends sfas no 95 “statement of cash flows” while the fair value method under sfas no 123r is similar to the fair value method under sfas no 123 with regards to measurement and recognition of stockbased compensation there are several key differences between the two standards for example sfas no 123 permits us to recognize forfeitures as they occur while sfas no 123r will require us to estimate future forfeitures and adjust our estimate on a quarterly basis sfas no 123r will also require a classification change in the statement of cash flows whereby a portion of the income tax benefit from stock options will move from operating cash flow activities to financing cash flow activities total cash flows will remain unchanged in march 2005 the securities and exchange commission “sec” released sab no 107 “sharebased payment”  which provides the sec’s views regarding the interaction between sfas no 123r and certain sec rules and regulations for public companies in april 2005 the sec adopted a rule that amends the compliance dates of sfas no 123r under the revised compliance dates we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 123r no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2007 the expensing of stockbased compensation will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations and may not be similar to our pro forma disclosure under sfas no 123 as amended 

in october 2005 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” financial accounting standard “fas” no 123r 2 “practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fasb statement no 123r”  the fasb provides companies with a “practical accommodation” when determining the grant date of an award subject to sfas no 123r if 1 the award is a unilateral grant that is the recipient does not have the ability to negotiate the key terms and conditions of the award with the employer 2 the key terms and conditions of the award are expected to be communicated to an individual recipient within a relatively short time period and 3 as long as all other criteria in the grant date definition have been met then a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of an award is presumed to exist at the date the award is approved in november 2005 the fasb issued fsp fas no 123r3 “transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of sharebased payment awards”  the fasb allows for a practical exception in calculating the additional paid — in capital pool of excess tax benefits upon adoption that is available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized 

53 subsequent to adoption sfas no 123r accordingly we may adopt either the method prescribed under sfas no 123r or the one prescribed under fsp fas no 123r3 we have not yet determined which method to adopt in february 2006 the fasb issued fsp fas no 123r4 “classification of options and similar instruments issued as employee compensation that allow for cash settlement upon the occurrence of a contingent event”  which amends certain paragraphs in sfas no 123r fsp fas no 123r4 addresses situations when a company has option plans that require the company to settle outstanding options in cash upon the occurrence of certain contingent events although we are required to apply fsp fas no 123r4 when we initially adopt sfas no 123r we do not expect it to impact our consolidated financial statements 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections — a replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3”  sfas no 154 changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle under previous guidance changes in accounting principle were recognized as a cumulative effect in the net income of the period of the change the new statement requires retrospective application of changes in accounting principle limited to the direct effects of the change to prior periods’ financial statements unless it is impracticable to determine either the periodspecific effects or the cumulative effect of the change additionally this statement requires that a change in depreciation amortization or depletion method for longlived nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle and that correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a “restatement” sfas no 154 is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 we do not believe that upon adoption sfas no 154 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements however after adoption if a change in accounting principle is made sfas no 154 could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 155 “accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments — an amendment of fasb statements no 133 and 140 ” sfas no 155 1 permits fair value measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation 2 clarifies that interestonly strips and principalonly strips are not subject to the requirements of sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities”  3 establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation 4 clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives and 5 amends sfas no 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities — a replacement of fasb statement 125” to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying specialpurpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument sfas no 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2006 we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 155 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

 54  

 during fiscal 2006 we generated 596 million of cash from operating activities as compared to 634 million for fiscal 2005 the decrease in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to our overall decline in net income resulting from a decrease in net revenue and an increase in operating expenses primarily to support the development of titles for nextgeneration consoles this decrease was partially offset by a lower accounts receivable balance as of march 31 2006 as compared to march 31 2005 resulting from a higher percentage of net revenue recognized in the first two months of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 which allowed us to collect a higher percentage of our receivables prior to the end of the quarter we expect cash from operating activities to decline in fiscal 2007 

for fiscal 2006 our primary use of cash in nonoperating activities consisted of 755 million used to purchase shortterm investments 709 million used to repurchase and retire a portion of our common stock 661 million used primarily for our acquisition of jamdat and 123 million in capital expenditures primarily related to the expansion of our vancouver studio and investments in our worldwide development tools technologies and equipment these nonoperating expenditures were partially offset by 1427 million in proceeds from the maturities and sales of shortterm investments and 206 million in proceeds from sales of common stock through our employee stock plans and other plans during fiscal 2007 we anticipate making continued capital investments in our studios as well as investments in nextgeneration consoles online infrastructure and mobile platforms 

 as of march 31 2006 our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments was comprised of 55 percent cash and cash equivalents and 45 percent shortterm investments as of march 31 2005 43 percent of our portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents and 57 percent of our portfolio consisted of shortterm investments in absolute dollars our cash and cash equivalents decreased from 1270 million as of march 31 2005 to 1242 million as of march 31 2006 this decrease was primarily due to our purchase of shortterm investments our acquisition of jamdat and our common stock repurchase program during the first six months of fiscal 2006 these decreases were partially offset by proceeds received from the maturities and sales of shortterm investments due to our mix of fixed and variable rate securities our shortterm investment portfolio is susceptible to changes in shortterm interest rates as of march 31 2006 our shortterm investments included gross unrealized losses of approximately 7 million or less than 1 percent of the total in shortterm investments from time to time we may liquidate some or all of our shortterm investments to fund operational needs or other activities such as capital expenditures business acquisitions or stock repurchase programs depending on which shortterm investments we liquidate to fund these activities we could recognize a portion of the gross unrealized losses 

marketable equity securities increased to 160 million as of march 31 2006 from 140 million as of march 31 2005 primarily due to an increase in the unrealized gain on our investment in ubisoft entertainment 

 our gross accounts receivable balances were 431 million and 458 million as of march 31 2006 and 2005 respectively the decrease in our accounts receivable balance was primarily due to a higher percentage of revenue recognized in the first two months of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 which allowed us to collect a higher percentage of our net revenue during the quarter reserves for sales returns pricing allowances and doubtful accounts increased in absolute dollars from 162 million as of march 31 2005 to 232 million as of march 31 2006 as a percentage of trailing six and nine month net revenue reserves increased from 8 percent and 6 percent respectively as of march 31 2005 to 12 percent and 9 percent respectively as of march 31 2006 the increase in these reserves was primarily the result of lower anticipated demand for our products and the continued decline in the average prices of our titles for currentgeneration consoles due to the competitive retail environment we believe these reserves are adequate based on historical experience and our current estimate of potential returns pricing allowances and doubtful accounts 

 inventories decreased slightly to 61 million as of march 31 2006 from 62 million as of march 31 2005 no single title represented more than 7 million of inventory as of march 31 2006 

 other current assets increased to 234 million as of march 31 2006 from 164 million as of march 31 2005 primarily due to an increase in prepaid royalties as we continue to invest in our product development and content as well as an increase in advertising credits owed to us by our vendors due to the timing of our claims 

 accounts payable increased to 163 million as of march 31 2006 from 134 million as of march 31 2005 primarily due to higher sales volumes and higher expenditures to support our business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 

 our accrued and other liabilities increased to 706 million as of march 31 2006 from 673 million as of march 31 2005 the increase was primarily due to liabilities related to our jamdat acquisition and an increase in deferred revenue 

 our longterm position of deferred income taxes changed by 48 million from an asset position as of march 31 2005 to a liability position as of march 31 2006 primarily due to 1 a longterm deferred tax liability we recorded in connection with our jamdat acquisition purchase accounting and 2 the utilization of tax credits during fiscal 2006 

 we believe that existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments marketable equity securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months including working capital requirements capital expenditures potential future acquisitions or strategic investments we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position facilitate expansion pursue strategic acquisitions and investments or to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise there can be no assurance however that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms if at all or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders

a portion of our cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and marketable equity securities that was generated from operations domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions approximately 692 million as of march 31 2006 is designated as indefinitely reinvested in the respective tax jurisdiction during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 our ceo approved a domestic reinvestment plan which was subsequently approved by our board of directors to repatriate 375 million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 under the jobs act we completed the repatriation in fiscal 2006 and resulted in a tax expense of 17 million related to this 375 million repatriation 

on october 18 2004 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to an aggregate of 750 million of our common stock pursuant to the authorization we repurchased shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market until we had completed our common stock repurchase program in september 2005 we repurchased and retired the following in millions

60 causing the facilities to be sold to a third party in the event of a sale to a third party we would be required to reimburse the difference between the actual sale price and 247 million up to a total maximum of 222 million alternatively in order to avoid being evicted or having the two facilities sold to a third party we could elect to purchase the phase one and phase two facilities for a combined maximum purchase price of 247 million 

we believe that as of march 31 2006 the estimated fair values of both properties under these operating leases exceeded their respective guaranteed residual values of 117 million for the phase one facility and 105 million for the phase two facility as of march 31 2006 

 in february 2006 we entered into an agreement with an independent third party to lease a studio facility in guildford surrey united kingdom which will commence in june 2006 and will expire in may 2016 the facility comprises a total of approximately 95000 square feet which we intend to use for research and development functions our rental obligation under this agreement is approximately 33 million over the initial tenyear term of the lease 

in june 2004 we entered into a lease agreement amended in december 2005 with an independent third party for a studio facility in orlando florida the lease commenced in january 2005 and expires in june 2010 with one fiveyear option to extend the lease term the campus facilities comprise a total of 140000 square feet and provide space for research and development functions our rental obligation over the initial fiveandahalf year term of the lease is 15 million as of march 31 2006 our remaining rental obligation under this lease was 14 million 

in july 2003 we entered into a lease agreement with an independent third party the “landlord” for a studio facility in los angeles california which commenced in october 2003 and expires in september 2013 with two fiveyear options to extend the lease term additionally we have options to purchase the property after five and ten years based on the fair market value of the property at the date of sale a right of first offer to purchase the property upon terms offered by the landlord and a right to share in the profits from a sale of the property we have accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with sfas no 13 as amended existing campus facilities comprise a total of 243000 square feet and provide space for research and development functions our rental obligation under this agreement is 50 million over the initial tenyear term of the lease this commitment is offset by expected sublease income of 6 million for a sublease to an affiliate of the landlord of 18000 square feet of the los angeles facility which commenced in october 2003 and expires in september 2013 with options of early termination by the affiliate after five years and by us after four and five years as of march 31 2006 our remaining rental obligation under this lease was 43 million of which 5 million was offset by expected sublease income 

in october 2002 we entered into a lease agreement with an independent third party for a studio facility in vancouver british columbia canada which commenced in may 2003 and expires in april 2013 we amended the lease in october 2003 the facility comprises a total of approximately 65000 square feet and provides space for research and development functions our rental obligation under this agreement is approximately 16 million over the initial tenyear term of the lease as of march 31 2006 our remaining rental obligation under this lease was 12 million 

 on february 14 2005 an employmentrelated class action lawsuit hasty v electronic arts inc was filed against the company in superior court in san mateo california the complaint alleges that we improperly classified “engineers” in california as exempt employees and seeks injunctive relief unspecified monetary damages interest and attorneys’ fees on may 16 2006 the court granted its preliminary approval of a settlement pursuant to which we agreed to make a lump sum payment of 149 million to be paid to a thirdparty administrator to cover a all claims allegedly suffered by the class members b plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees not to exceed 25 of the total settlement amount c plaintiffs’ costs and expenses d any incentive payments to the named plaintiffs that may be authorized by the court and e all costs of administration of the settlement the hearing for the court to consider its final approval of the settlement is set for september 22 2006 

each of the shareholder actions we have previously disclosed have been voluntarily dismissed by all plaintiffs the federal securities class action complaint has been dismissed with prejudice by an order dated january 26 2006 the federal derivative action has been dismissed by an order dated march 10 2006 and the two state derivative actions have been dismissed by orders dated may 4 2006 and may 8 2006 

in addition we are subject to other claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we believe that any liability from any reasonably foreseeable disposition of such other claims and litigation individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 we have entered into indemnification agreements with the members of our board of directors at the time they joined the board to indemnify them to the extent permitted by law against any and all liabilities costs expenses amounts paid in settlement and damages incurred by the directors as a result of any lawsuit or any judicial administrative or investigative proceeding in which the directors are sued or charged as a result of their service as members of our board of directors 

inflation 

we believe the impact of inflation on our results of operations has not been significant for each of the past three fiscal years 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market prices market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks foreign currency option and foreign exchange forward contracts are used to either hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to market risk we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report interest rate risk is the potential loss arising from changes in interest rates we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be exposed to significant interest rate risk because our portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

 from time to time we hedge some of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreigncurrencydenominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing option contracts that generally have maturities of 15 months or less these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges the derivative 

62 assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity and subsequently reclassified into net revenue or operating expenses as appropriate in the period when the forecasted transaction is recorded the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value if any is reported in each period in interest and other income net in our consolidated statement of operations our hedging programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements in revenue and operating expenses as of march 31 2006 we had no foreign currency option contracts outstanding as of march 31 2005 we had foreign currency option contracts outstanding with a total fair value of 1 million included in other current assets 

we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreigncurrencydenominated assets and liabilities primarily intercompany receivables and payables the forward contracts generally have a contractual term of approximately one month and are transacted near monthend therefore the fair value of the forward contracts generally is not significant at each monthend our foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 133 and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts are reported as other current assets or other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet and gains and losses from changes in fair value are reported in interest and other income net the gains and losses on these forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying foreigncurrencydenominated assets and liabilities which are also reported in interest and other income net in our consolidated statement of operations 

as of march 31 2006 we had forward foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell approximately 161 million in foreign currencies of this amount 132 million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars 14 million to sell foreign currencies in exchange for british pound sterling and 15 million to purchase foreign currency in exchange for us dollars as of march 31 2005 we had forward foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell approximately 425 million of foreign currencies of this amount 379 million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars 22 million to sell foreign currencies in exchange for british pound sterling and 24 million to purchase foreign currency in exchange for us dollars the fair value of our forward contracts was immaterial as of march 31 2006 and march 31 2005 

the counterparties to these forward and option contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks the risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are not considered to be material 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurances that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations as of march 31 2006 we had no foreign currency option contracts outstanding as of march 31 2005 a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would not have resulted in a material loss in fair value of our option contracts under either scenario however a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would result in potential losses on our forward contracts of 16 million and 23 million respectively as of march 31 2006 and 40 million and 61 million respectively as of march 31 2005 this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift in foreign currency exchange rates which do not always move in the same direction actual results may differ materially 

 our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities additionally the contractual terms of the securities do not permit the issuer to call prepay or otherwise settle the securities at prices less than the stated par value of the securities our investments are held for purposes other than trading also we do not use derivative financial instruments or leverage in our shortterm investment portfolio 

63 as of march 31 2006 and 2005 our shortterm investments were classified as availableforsale and consequently recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of any tax effects in stockholders’ equity our portfolio of shortterm investments consisted of the following investment categories summarized by fair value as of march 31 2006 and 2005 in millions 

 notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations at any time a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value in our shortterm investment portfolio as of march 31 2006 arising from potential changes in interest rates the modeling technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps 

 the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value in our shortterm investment portfolio as of march 31 2005 arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 

 

 the value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies are subject to market price volatility as of march 31 2006 our marketable equity securities were classified as availableforsale and consequently were recorded in our consolidated balance sheets at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses 

64 reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of any tax effects in stockholders’ equity the fair value of our marketable equity securities was 160 million and 140 million as of march 31 2006 and 2005 respectively 

at any time a sharp change in market prices in our investments in marketable equity securities could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investments the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value in our marketable equity securities as of march 31 2006 arising from changes in market prices plus or minus 25 percent 50 percent and 75 percent

 item 1 business 

overview 

electronic arts develops markets publishes and distributes interactive software games we sometimes refer to them as “titles” that are playable by consumers on the following devices 

 we refer to consoles pcs mobility and online collectively as “platforms” 

we were initially incorporated in california in 1982 in september 1991 we reincorporated under the laws of delaware our principal executive offices are located near san francisco california at 209 redwood shores parkway redwood city california 94065 and our telephone number is 650 6281500 

one of our strengths is our ability to publish interactive software games for multiple platforms our products that are designed to play on consoles and mobile platforms are published under license from the manufacturers of these platforms for example sony for the playstation 2 and psp microsoft for the xbox and nintendo for the nintendo gamecube game boy advance and nintendo ds and we pay a fee to these platform manufacturers for technology and intellectual property which enables us to publish products on their platforms we invest in the creation of software tools to more efficiently develop games for multiple platforms we also make investments in facilities and equipment that allow us to create and edit video and audio recordings that are used in our games since our inception we have published games for over 45 different platforms 

our product development methods and organization are modeled on those used in other sectors of the entertainment industry employees whom we call “producers” are responsible for overseeing the development of one or more products the interactive software games that we develop and publish are broken down into three major categories 1 ea studio products 2 copublishing products and 3 distribution products 

  ea studio products 

we develop games internally at our development and production studios located near san francisco los angeles orlando florida chicago vancouver montreal london and tokyo we also engage third parties to develop games on our behalf at their own development and production studios we publish our ea studio products under three major brands 

 3    copublishing and distribution products 

through our ea partners global business unit we team with other game development companies that develop their own interactive software games with our assistance which we then publish market and distribute an example of one of our recent copublishing products is timesplitters future perfect tm  which was developed by free radical design a game development company located near london we also distribute interactive software games that are developed by other companies an example of one of our recent distribution products is star wars knights of the old republic ii the sith lords  published by lucasarts which we distributed in japan 

another strength of our business is that we develop product families we call them “franchises” around many of our products for example every year we release new versions of most of our ea sports titles likewise we have been successful in developing marketing publishing and distributing sequels to several of our ea games and ea sports big products we also release products called “expansion packs” for pc titles that provide additional content characters storylines settings missions for games that we have previously published for example we have published an expansion pack the sims 2 university  which expands the characters settings and gameplay of the original the sims 2 game we consider titles that iterate sequel or spawn expansion packs to be franchise titles 

method of delivery 

the console pc and some mobile games that we publish are made available to consumers on a disk usually cd dvd or universal media disc “umd” format or a cartridge that is packaged and typically sold in retail stores and through online stores including our own online store we refer to these as “packaged goods” products in north america and europe our largest markets these packaged goods products are sold primarily to retailers that may be mass market retailers such as walmart electronics specialty stores such as best buy or game software specialty stores such as gamestop we also maintain a smaller business where we license to manufacturers of products in related industries for example makers of personal computers or computer accessories rights to include certain of our products with the manufacturer’s product or offer our products to consumers who have purchased the manufacturer’s product we call these combined products “oem bundles” 

there are three ways in which we publish games that are playable online by consumers 1 we publish games that are playable only online one type of these onlineonly games is called “persistent state worlds” or “massively multiplayer online games” players experience these games as interactive virtual worlds where thousands of other players can interact with one another an example of our persistent state world products is ultima online  these persistent state world games are often sold to consumers in the form of a cd or dvd that contains much of the software necessary to play the game online after loading the game disk on their pcs players are able to logon to servers that we make available in order to interact with other players 2 other types of onlineonly games that we publish are available on the world wide web and include card games puzzle games and word games marketed under our “pogo tm ” brand all of which are made available to consumers on our web site wwwpogocom and on certain online services provided by america online inc and 3 we include online capability features in certain of our pc playstation 2 and xbox products which enable consumers to participate in online communities and play against one another via the internet 

4 intellectual property 

like other entertainment companies our business is based on the creation acquisition exploitation and protection of intellectual property some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code patented technology and other technology and trade secrets that we use to develop our games and to make them run properly on the platforms other intellectual property is in the form of audiovisual elements that consumers can see hear and interact with when they are playing our games — we call this form of intellectual property “content” 

each of our products embodies a number of separate forms of intellectual property protection the software and the content of our products are copyrighted our product brands and names may be trademarks of ours or others our products may contain voices and likenesses of actors athletes andor commentators protected by personal publicity rights and often contain musical compositions and performances that are also copyrighted our products also may contain other content licensed from others such as trademarks fictional characters storylines and software code 

we acquire the rights to include these kinds of intellectual property in our products through license agreements such as those with sports leagues and player associations movie studios and performing talent music labels music publishers and musicians these licenses are typically limited to use of the licensed rights in products for specific time periods in addition our products that play on consoles such as the sony playstation 2 include technology that is owned by the console manufacturer and licensed nonexclusively to us for use while we may have renewal rights for some licenses our business and the justification for the development of many of our products is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain the intellectual property rights from the owners of these rights at reasonable rates 

our products are susceptible to unauthorized copying we typically distribute our pc products using copy protection technology that we license from other companies in addition console manufacturers such as sony typically incorporate security devices in their consoles in an effort to prevent unlicensed use of products our primary protection against unauthorized use duplication and distribution of our products is enforcement of our copyright and trademark interests we typically own the copyright to the software code as well as the brand or title name trademark under which our products are marketed we register our copyrights in the united states and register our significant trademarks in multiple countries including the united states 

market segment 

historically there have been multiple consoles available that play interactive software games like ours and there has been vigorous competition between console manufacturers while sony has for the past several years been the clear business segment leader with its playstation® and playstation 2 consoles microsoft and nintendo are large and viable competitors and pcs continue to be a strong interactive game platform we develop and publish products for multiple platforms and this diversification continues to be a cornerstone of our product strategy 

we currently develop or publish products for eleven different hardware platforms in fiscal 2005 we released games designed to play on the playstation 2 xbox nintendo gamecube playstation pc game boy advance nokia ngage tm  sony psp nintendo ds and the internet in fiscal 2006 we plan to release games designed for play on the playstation 2 xbox xbox 360 nintendo gamecube pc game boy advance nokia ngage sony psp nintendo ds the internet and cellular phones among others 

 the currentgeneration of systems was initiated by the launch of sony’s playstation 2 in fiscal 2001 and continued with the launches of the nintendo gamecube and microsoft’s xbox in fiscal 2002 the following table details select information on a sample of the console platforms for which we have published titles 

 playstation 2 sony released the playstation 2 console in japan in march 2000 in north america in october 2000 and in europe in november 2000 the playstation 2 console is a 128bit dvdbased system that with a network adaptor is internet ready as well as backward compatible with games published for its predecessor the playstation we have published and are currently developing numerous products for the sony playstation 2 

nintendo gamecube nintendo launched the nintendo gamecube console in japan in september 2001 in north america in november 2001 and in europe in may 2002 the nintendo gamecube plays games that are manufactured on a proprietary optical disk we have published and are currently developing numerous products for the nintendo gamecube 

xbox microsoft launched the xbox console in north america in november 2001 in japan in february 2002 and in europe in march 2002 the microsoft xbox is a 128bit dvdbased system that is internet ready in may 2004 we began to support the xbox live service with features including quickmatch optimatch gamertags xbox live friends list voice communication and ea messenger service we have published and are currently developing numerous products for the microsoft xbox 

 while nintendo has been the leading manufacturer of mobile video game platforms sony has recently entered this market with its psp the following table details select information on a sample of the mobile platforms for which we have published titles 

 nintendo ds nintendo launched the nintendo ds in north america in november 2004 in japan in december 2004 and in europe in march 2005 we have published several products and are currently developing several more products for the nintendo ds 

sony psp sony launched the psp in japan in december 2004 and in north america in march 2005 the sony psp is a umd based system we have published several products and are currently developing and expect to develop numerous products for the sony psp 

 to date we have had limited success in finding ways of generating revenue and profits from online games including subscription fees “paytoplay fees” micro transactions and advertising in addition we have had limited experience with developing optimal pricing strategies or predicting usage patterns for our online games in our history we have launched five persistent state world products with mixed results while we have achieved success with ultima online  our other persistent state world products most notably the sims online have not met our expectations 

in fiscal 2004 we launched club pogo tm  a subscription service for pogo offering exclusive games and premium features we have over 800000 paying subscribers as of march 31 2005 up from 308000 paying subscribers as of march 31 2004 

despite our limited success to date we believe that online capability is integral to our existing and future products the continued growth of the online sector of our industry will depend on the following key factors 

 

 during the next 18 months we expect the nextgeneration of consoles to be released by microsoft sony and nintendo our early investment in products designed for play on 32 and 128bit consoles such as the playstation and playstation 2 respectively has been strategically important in positioning us for the nextgeneration of consoles we believe that such investment continues to be important as the nextgeneration of consoles is expected to introduce new complexities such as bluray diskread only memory “bdrom” andor highdefinition video technologies as we move through the life cycle of currentgeneration consoles we will continue to devote resources to developing games for these consoles while at the same time increasing our investment in tools and technologies for the nextgeneration of consoles 

competition 

we compete in the entertainment industry at the most fundamental level our products compete with other forms of entertainment such as motion pictures television and music for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers we believe that the software games segment is best viewed as a segment of the overall entertainment market we believe that large software companies and media companies are increasing their focus on the software games segment of the entertainment market and as a result may become more direct competitors several large software companies and media companies eg microsoft and sony have been publishing products that compete with ours for a long time and other diversified mediaentertainment companies eg time warner and disney have announced their intent to significantly expand their software game publishing efforts in the future 

the software games business is highly competitive it is characterized by the continuous introduction of new titles and the development of new technologies our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large diversified corporations with greater financial and marketing resources than ours our business is driven by hit titles which require everincreasing budgets for development and marketing as a result the availability of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in developing and marketing software games competition is also based on product quality and features timing of product releases brandname recognition quality of ingame content access to distribution channels effectiveness of marketing and price 

7 we currently compete with sony microsoft and nintendo each of which develop and publish software for their respective console platforms we also compete with numerous companies which are like us licensed by the console manufacturers to develop and publish software games that operate on their consoles these competitors include activision atari capcom eidos koei konami lucasarts midway namco sega taketwo interactive thq ubisoft and vivendi universal games among others as discussed above diversified media companies such as time warner and disney have also indicated their intent to significantly expand their software game publishing efforts in the future 

in addition to competing for product sales we face heavy competition from other software game companies to obtain license agreements granting us the right to use intellectual property included in our products and some of these content licenses are controlled by the diversified media companies which intend to expand their software game publishing divisions 

finally the market for our products is characterized by significant price competition and we regularly face pricing pressures from our competitors these pressures have from time to time required us to reduce our prices on certain products our experience has been that software game prices tend to decline once a generation of consoles has been in the market for a significant period of time due to the increasing number of software titles competing for acceptance by consumers and the anticipation of the nextgeneration of consoles

 many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our ea sports products include rights licensed from the major sports leagues and players associations similarly many of our hit ea games franchises such as james bond harry potter and lord of the rings are based on key film and literary licenses in fiscal 2005 we entered into exclusive license agreements with espn the nfl players inc the nfl players’ association collegiate licensing company the licensing authority for ncaa football and the arena football league in addition we have longstanding exclusive relationships with various sports organizations and celebrities including fifa uefa professional soccer nascar tiger woods and the pga tour and in the future we may enter into other exclusive relationships with other partners 

products and product development 

in fiscal 2005 we generated approximately 71 percent of our net revenue from ea studioproduced products released during the year as compared to approximately 69 percent in fiscal 2004 during fiscal 2005 we introduced 35 ea studios titles representing 109 stock keeping units or skus compared to 32 ea studios titles comprising 97 skus in fiscal 2004 in fiscal 2005 we had 31 titles that sold over one million units aggregated across all platforms in fiscal 2004 we had 27 titles and in fiscal 2003 we had 22 titles that sold over one million units aggregated across all platforms a sku is a version of a title designed for play on a particular platform and intended for distribution in a particular territory in fiscal 2005 we had one title need for speed underground 2  published on five different platforms which represented approximately 11 percent of our total net revenue no title represented more than 10 percent of our total net revenue in fiscal 2004 while in fiscal 2003 we had one title harry potter and the chamber of secrets tm  published on seven different platforms which represented approximately 10 percent of our total net revenue 

the products produced by ea studios are designed and created by our employee designers and artists and by nonemployee software developers we call them “independent artists” or “thirdparty developers” we typically advance development funds to the independent artists and thirdparty developers during development of our games which payments are considered advances against subsequent royalties based on the sales of the products these terms are typically set forth in written agreements entered into with the independent artists and thirdparty developers 

the retail selling prices of our newly released products in north america typically range from 2999 to 4999 other titles including rereleases of older titles marketed as “classics” have retail selling prices that range from 999 to 2999 the retail selling prices of our titles outside of north america vary widely depending on factors such as local market conditions 

our goal is to maintain our position as a leading publisher of games sold for play on the currentgeneration of 128bit video game consoles and to extend our success into the nextgeneration of consoles and mobile platforms we will continue to invest in tools and technologies designed to facilitate development of our products for currentgeneration platforms while also investing in tools and technologies for the nextgeneration of consoles and mobile platforms these investments are recorded in research and development in our consolidated statement of operations we had research and development expenditures of 633 million in fiscal 2005 511 million in fiscal 2004 and 401 million in fiscal 2003

10 franchises such as madden nfl fifa soccer and nba live products marketed under the ea sports big brand typically feature extreme sports or modified traditional sports in an arcadestyle game and include such titles as def jam fight for ny  fifa street and nfl street 2 unleashed 

formerly known as electronic arts distribution our ea partners global business unit operates under a variety of deal types and structures with the intent of generating leveraging andor owning intellectual properties conceived by other developers publishers or licensors worldwide through ea partners we provide direct development expertise to our partners via an internal production staff while also making available our publishing resources to provide sales marketing and distribution services on a global basis ea partners currently has relationships with lionhead crytek free radical design and eurocom entertainment software among others 

ea partners also distributes finished goods on behalf of other publishers these titles are developed and manufactured by other publishers and delivered to us as completed products for which we provide distribution services in fiscal 2005 our distribution partners included capcom and namco 

the interactive software game business is “hit” driven requiring significantly greater expenditures for marketing and advertising of our products there can be no assurance that we will continue to produce “hit” titles or that advertising for any product will increase sales sufficiently to recoup those advertising expenses 

we generated approximately 95 percent of our north american net revenue from direct sales to retailers the remaining 5 percent of our north american sales were made through a limited number of specialized and regional distributors and rack jobbers in markets where we believe direct sales would not be economical we had direct sales to one customer walmart stores inc which represented 14 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2005 13 percent in fiscal 2004 and 12 percent in fiscal 2003 

outside of north america we derive revenues primarily from direct sales to retailers our largest indirect sales relationship is with pinnacle in europe sales of our products through pinnacle make up approximately 10 percent of our total net revenue we use pinnacle to provide logistical and collection services to our retail customers under the terms of our distribution agreement with pinnacle product is held by pinnacle on consignment until shipment to the retailer in addition we authorize returns from or price protection to retailers and are obliged to give pinnacle the corresponding credit in a few of our smaller markets we sell our products through distributors with whom we have written agreements or informal arrangements depending on the business customs of the territories 

in north america we have stockbalancing programs for our pc products which allow for the exchange of pc products by resellers under certain circumstances in all of our major geographical markets we accept product returns on our pc products and we may decide to accept product returns or provide price protection under certain circumstances for our console products after we analyze inventory remaining in the channel the rate of inventory sellthrough in the channel and our remaining inventory on hand it is our policy to exchange products or give credits rather than give cash refunds we actively monitor and manage the volume of our sales to retailers and distributors and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel can result in high returns or the requirement for substantial price protection in subsequent periods 

the distribution channels through which our games are sold have been characterized by change including consolidations and financial difficulties of certain distributors and retailers the bankruptcy or other business difficulties of a distributor or retailer could render our accounts receivable from such entity uncollectible which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition in addition an increasing number of companies are competing for access to our distribution channels our arrangements with our distributors and retailers may be terminated by either party at any time without cause distributors and retailers often carry products that compete with ours retailers of our products typically have a limited amount of shelf space and promotional resources that they are willing to devote to the software games category and there is intense competition for these resources there can be no assurance that distributors and retailers will continue to purchase our products or provide our products with adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support 

11 inventory and working capital 

we manage inventories by communicating with our customers prior to the release of our products and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct and territorybyterritory basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that match this forecasted demand historically we have experienced high turnover of our products and the lead times on reorders of our products are generally short approximately two to three weeks further as discussed in “marketing and distribution” and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we have practices in place with our customers such as stock balancing and price protection that reduce product returns 

international operations 

we conduct business and have whollyowned subsidiaries throughout the world including offices in australia austria belgium brazil canada china the czech republic denmark england finland france germany greece hungary italy japan the netherlands new zealand norway poland portugal singapore south africa south korea spain sweden switzerland taiwan and thailand international net revenue increased by nine percent to 1464 billion or 47 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2005 compared to 1347 billion or 46 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2004 our increase in international net revenue was primarily driven by sales in europe and asia pacific including the benefit of foreign exchange 

we believe that in order to increase our sales in asia we will need to devote significant resources to hire local development talent and expand our infrastructure most notably the expansion and creation of studio facilities to develop content locally for each market in addition we may establish online game marketing publishing and distribution functions in china as part of this strategy we may seek to partner with established local companies through acquisitions joint ventures or other similar arrangements 

the amounts of net revenue and identifiable assets attributable to each of our geographic regions for each of the last three fiscal years are set forth in note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

manufacturing and suppliers 

the suppliers we use to manufacture our games can be characterized in three types 

 in many instances we are able to acquire materials on a volumediscount basis we have multiple potential sources of supply for most materials except for the disk component of our playstation 2 psp and nintendo gamecube disk products as discussed in “significant relationships” we also have alternate sources for the manufacture and assembly of most of our products to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in production of our software and related documentation and packaging however a shortage of components manufacturing delays by sony or nintendo or other factors beyond our control could impair our ability to manufacture or have manufactured our products 

backlog 

we typically ship orders immediately upon receipt to the extent that any backlog may or may not exist at the end of a reporting period it would be both coincidental and an unreliable indicator of future results of any period 

seasonality 

our business is highly seasonal we typically experience our highest revenue and profits in the holiday season quarter ending in december and a seasonal low in revenue and profits in the quarter ending in june our 

12 results however can vary based on title release dates consumer demand for our products and shipment schedules among other factors 

employees 

as of march 31 2005 we employed approximately 6100 people of whom over 3400 were outside the united states we believe that our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is a critical factor in the successful development of our products and that our future success will depend in large measure on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees to date we have been successful in recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified personnel to conduct our business successfully we believe that our relationships with our employees are strong less than four percent of our employees each of whom is employed by one of our swedish subsidiaries are represented by a union guild or other collective bargaining organization

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation tableend overview 

the following overview is a toplevel discussion of our operating results as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers is important in order to understand our results for fiscal 2005 as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form 10k including in “business” the remainder of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “risk factors” or the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

 we develop market publish and distribute interactive software games that are playable by consumers on home video game consoles such as the sony playstation 2 microsoft xbox and nintendo gamecube consoles personal computers mobile platforms — including handheld game players such as the game boy advance nintendo ds and sony psp and cellular handsets — and online over the internet and other proprietary online networks some of our games are based on content that we license from others eg madden nfl football harry potter and fifa soccer and some of our games are based on our own whollyowned intellectual property eg the sims and need for speed our goal is to develop titles which appeal to the mass markets which often means translating and localizing them for sale in nonenglish speaking countries in addition we also attempt to create software game “franchises” that allow us to publish new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the same property examples of this are the annual iterations of our sportsbased franchises eg ncaa football and fifa soccer titles based on longlived movie properties eg james bond and harry potter and whollyowned properties that can be successfully sequeled eg the sims and need for speed 

 total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2005 was 3129 billion up 58 percent as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2004 six franchises sold more than five million units in the fiscal year ended march 31 2005 the sims need for speed madden fifa the lord of the rings and harry potter we published three titles each on the nintendo ds and the sony psp two new platforms released during the year ended march 31 2005 net revenue on these platforms increased our net revenue by approximately 41 million and we expect to continue to develop titles for both platforms in fiscal 2006 

net income for the fiscal year ended march 31 2005 was 504 million a 127 percent decrease as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2004 and diluted earnings per share were 159 as compared with 187 for the prior year 

we generated 634 million in cash from operations during the year ended march 31 2005 as compared to 669 million in the fiscal year ended march 31 2004 the decrease in cash flow was primarily the result of 1 our overall decline in net income for fiscal 2005 2 higher accounts receivable balances due to the timing of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and 3 higher cash payments for income taxes these declines were partially offset by higher balances in our current liabilities 

 transition to nextgeneration consoles our industry is cyclical and we believe it has entered into a transition stage heading into the next cycle over the course of the next eighteen months we expect sony microsoft and nintendo to introduce new video game consoles into the market during this transition we intend to continue developing new titles for the current generation of video game consoles while we also make significant investments as we prepare to introduce products that operate on the nextgeneration consoles we have and expect to continue to incur higher costs during this transition to nextgeneration consoles we also expect development costs for nextgeneration video games to be greater on a pertitle basis than development costs for currentgeneration video games in addition sales of video games for current generation consoles may begin to decline and consumers may defer game software purchases until the nextgeneration consoles become 

21 available while we expect our sales and gross profit to increase in fiscal 2006 such increases may not offset the increased costs we have and expect to continue to incur during the transition as we move through the transition we expect our operating results to be more volatile and difficult to predict which could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly 

increasing cost of titles titles have become increasingly expensive to produce and market as the platforms on which they are played continue to advance technologically and consumers demand continual improvements in the overall gameplay experience we expect this trend to continue throughout the transition from current generation to next generation platforms as 1 we require larger production teams to create our titles 2 the technology needed to develop titles becomes more complex 3 the number and nature of the platforms for which we develop titles increases and becomes more diverse 4 the cost of licensing the thirdparty intellectual property we use in many of our titles increases and 5 we develop new methods to distribute our content via the internet and on handheld and wireless devices 

software prices as currentgeneration console prices continue to decrease we expect more valueoriented consumers to purchase consoles and software we experienced this trend several years ago when prices were reduced on previousgeneration consoles eg sony playstation and nintendo 64 as a result of a more valueoriented consumer base and a greater number of software titles being published we expect average software prices to continue to decline on currentgeneration consoles which may have a negative impact on our gross margin but not necessarily our gross profit 

sales of “hit” titles sales of “hit” titles several of which were top sellers across a number of international markets continued to contribute to our revenue growth our top five selling titles across all platforms worldwide during the fiscal year ended march 31 2005 were need for speed underground 2  madden nfl 2005 fifa soccer 2005 the sims 2 and harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban hit titles are important to our financial performance because they benefit from overall economies of scale we have developed and it is our objective to continue to develop many of our hit titles to become franchise titles that can be regularly iterated 

increased console installed base as consumers purchase the currentgeneration of consoles either as a firsttime buyer or by upgrading from a previous generation the console installed base increases as the installed base for a particular console increases we generally are able to increase our unit volume however these unit volumes often begin to decrease as consumers anticipate the release of the nextgeneration of consoles in march 2004 microsoft reduced the retail price of its xbox console in the us and in may 2004 sony did the same with its playstation 2 console in august 2004 both companies also reduced their console retail prices in europe although these price reductions drove an increase in console sales in the united states and europe hardware shortages during the holiday season limited the growth of the installed base in fiscal 2005 nonetheless we believe the significant increase in the installed base for currentgeneration consoles was a contributing factor to our total net revenue growth during fiscal 2005 provided that the console manufacturers are able to deliver an adequate supply of consoles we expect the installed base of currentgeneration consoles to increase during fiscal 2006 and unit sales of currentgeneration titles to remain strong 

international operations and sales growth in fiscal 2005 net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately 47 percent of our total net revenue up from 46 percent during fiscal 2004 our increase in international net revenue was primarily driven by sales in europe and asia pacific including the benefit of foreign exchange we anticipate that international net revenue will continue to increase during fiscal 2006 as the console installed base continues to expand outside of north america in particular we believe that in order to succeed in china and japan it is important to develop content locally as such we expect to devote resources to hire local development talent and expand our infrastructure in each country most notably the expansion and creation of local studio facilities in addition we anticipate establishing online game marketing publishing and distribution functions in china as part of this strategy we may seek to partner with established local companies through acquisitions joint ventures or other similar arrangements 

foreign exchange impact given that a significant portion of our business is conducted internationally in foreign currency fluctuations in currency prices can have a material impact on our results of operations for example the average exchange rate for the euro as compared to the us dollar increased from 117 per euro during the twelve months ended march 31 2004 to 125 per euro during the twelve months ended march 31 2005 as a result of the fluctuations in currency prices we had a total foreign exchange benefit on 

22 net revenue of approximately 95 million during the twelve months ended march 31 2005 although we intend to continue to utilize foreign exchange forward and option contracts to either mitigate or hedge against some foreign currency exposures we cannot predict the effect foreign currency fluctuations will have on us during fiscal 2006 

expansion of studio resources and technology in fiscal 2005 we devoted significant resources to the overall expansion of our studio facilities in north america and europe we expect to continue to make significant investments in our studio facilities in north america in fiscal 2006 as we move through the life cycle of currentgeneration consoles we will continue to devote significant resources to the development of currentgeneration titles while at the same time we continue to invest heavily in tools and technologies for the nextgeneration of platforms and technology 

leader in interactive sports entertainment we are a leading developer and publisher of interactive sports entertainment we generate a significant portion of our revenue from sportsrelated product franchises such as fifa soccer madden nfl football ncaa football tiger woods golf nascar nba basketball and ncaa basketball we recently have taken a number of steps to enhance our products in the interactive sports category by entering into exclusive license agreements with espn the nfl players inc the nfl players’ association collegiate licensing company ncaa football and the arena football league in addition we have longstanding exclusive relationships with various sports organizations and celebrities including fifa the worldwide soccer governing body and sponsor of the soccer world cup uefa the european soccer governing body and sponsor of the soccer euro cup nascar tiger woods and the pga tour and in the future we may enter into other exclusive relationships with other sports partners while we expect to generate increased revenue as a result of these agreements it may not be enough to offset the impact of the associated costs on our gross profit which could negatively affect our gross margin on these products 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities contingent assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown as a result actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

 we principally derive revenue from sales of packaged interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation 2 xbox and nintendo gamecube pcs and mobile platforms including handheld game players such as the nintendo game boy advance nintendo ds and sony psp and cellular handsets we evaluate the recognition of revenue based on the criteria set forth in statement of position “sop” 972 “software revenue recognition”  as amended by sop 989 “modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” and staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements”  as revised by sab no 104 “revenue recognition”  we evaluate revenue recognition using the following basic criteria and recognize revenue when all four criteria are met 

 23 

 determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report for example for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to 1 determine whether and when each element has been delivered 2 determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services 3 determine whether vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” exists for each undelivered element and 4 allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver changes to any of these assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

product revenue including sales to resellers and distributors “channel partners” is recognized when the above criteria are met we reduce product revenue for estimated future returns price protection and other offerings which may occur with our customers and channel partners in certain countries we have stockbalancing programs for our pc products which allow for the exchange of pc products by resellers under certain circumstances it is our general practice to exchange products or give credits rather than give cash refunds 

in certain countries from time to time we decide to provide price protection for both our pc and video game system products in our decision we analyze historical returns current sellthrough of distributor and retailer inventory of our products current trends in the video game market and the overall economy changes in consumer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and price protection allowances in addition we monitor the volume of our sales to our channel partners and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods while historically actual returns and price protection have not generally exceeded our reserves as we have previously publicly stated in the quarter ended march 31 2005 we incurred higher actual returns and price protection than we had anticipated we have reviewed current sellthrough information through the date of this filing and do not intend to accept sales returns or provide price protection on unsold product in our distribution channels existing as of march 31 2005 in amounts in excess of our march 31 2005 allowances 

in the future actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms product updates or competing products for example the risk of product returns andor price protection for our products may increase as the playstation 2 xbox and nintendo gamecube consoles move through their lifecycles and an increasing number and aggregate amount of competitive products heighten pricing and competitive pressures while management believes it can make reliable estimates regarding these matters these estimates are inherently subjective accordingly if our estimates changed our returns and price protection reserves would change which would impact the total net revenue we report for example if actual returns andor price protection were significantly greater than the reserves we have established our actual results would decrease our reported total net revenue conversely if actual returns andor price protection were significantly less than our reserves this would increase our reported total net revenue 

significant judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly 

 our royalty expenses consist of payments to 1 content licensors 2 independent software developers and 3 copublishing andor distribution affiliates license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities 

24 professional sports organizations movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademark copyright personal publicity rights content andor other intellectual property royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games copublishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for delivery of product 

royaltybased payments made to content licensors and distribution affiliates generally are capitalized as prepaid royalties and expensed to cost of goods sold at the greater of the contractual or effective royalty rate based on net product sales prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and copublishing affiliates are generally in connection with the development of a particular product and therefore we are generally subject to development risk prior to the general release of the product accordingly payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed as research and development as the services are incurred payments due after completion of the product primarily royaltybased in nature are generally expensed as cost of goods sold at the higher of the contractual or effective royalty rate based on net product sales 

minimum guaranteed royalty obligations are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no significant performance remains with the licensor when significant performance remains with the licensor we record royalty payments as an asset when actually paid rather than upon execution of the contract minimum royalty payment obligations are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next twelve months as of march 31 2005 and march 31 2004 approximately 51 million and 63 million respectively of minimum guaranteed royalty obligations had been recognized 

each quarter we also evaluate the future realization of our royaltybased assets as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales any impairments determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense impairments determined postlaunch are charged to cost of goods sold in either case we rely on estimated revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties if actual sales or revised revenue estimates fall below the initial revenue estimate then the actual charge taken may be greater in any given quarter than anticipated as of march 31 2005 we had 135 million of royaltyrelated assets and 1483 million of unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid that could be impaired if our revenue estimates change 

valuation of longlived assets 

we evaluate both purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets in order to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in value exists this evaluation requires us to estimate among other things the remaining useful lives of the assets and future cash flows of the business these evaluations and estimates require the use of judgment our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates 

under current accounting standards we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet in order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred management makes various assumptions about the future value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash flows our future net cash flows are primarily dependent on the sale of products for play on proprietary video game consoles handheld game players and pcs collectively referred to as “platforms” the success of our products is affected by our ability to accurately predict which platforms and which products we develop will be successful also our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules due to product sales shortfalls we may not realize the future net cash flows necessary to recover our longlived assets which may result in an impairment charge being recorded in the future we did not record any asset impairment charges in fiscal 2005 during fiscal 2004 and 2003 we recognized less than 1 million and 66 million respectively of asset impairment charges 

25 income taxes 

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction where we operate these estimates involve complex issues require extended periods of time to resolve and require us to make judgments such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities we are also required to make determinations of the need to record deferred tax liabilities and the recoverability of deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is established to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction 

in addition changes in our business such as acquisitions changes in our international structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix of income as well as changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities valuation allowances applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate for future fiscal years for example in the three months ended march 31 2004 we resolved certain taxrelated matters with the internal revenue service which lowered our income tax expense by approximately 20 million and resulted in a 25 percent rate reduction for the fiscal year ended march 31 2004 by contrast adverse developments in audits or applicable law result in increases in our tax expense similarly we could experience an increase in our tax expense if we take advantage of a new election that we are entitled to make under the us income tax rules regarding the allocation between us and foreign jurisdictions of tax deductions attributable to employee stock option compensation 

results of operations 

our fiscal year is reported on a 5253week period that historically has ended on the final saturday of march in each year the results of operations for the fiscal years ended march 31 2005 2004 and 2003 each contain 52 weeks and ended on march 26 2005 march 27 2004 and march 29 2003 respectively for simplicity of presentation all fiscal periods are treated as ending on a calendar month end beginning with the fiscal year ending march 31 2006 we will end our fiscal year on the saturday nearest march 31 as a result our fiscal 2006 will be reported as a 53 week year with the first quarter containing 14 weeks although certain amounts presented have been rounded to the nearest million corresponding percentage changes have been calculated on the basis of amounts rounded to the nearest thousand 

 

 we principally derive net revenue from sales of packaged interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation 2 xbox and nintendo gamecube pcs and mobile platforms which include handheld game players such as the nintendo game boy advance nintendo ds and sony psp and cellular handsets additionally in europe and asia pacific we generate a significant portion of net revenue by marketing and selling thirdparty interactive software games through our established distribution network we also derive net revenue from selling subscriptions to some of our online games programming thirdparty web sites with our game content allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products and selling advertisements on our online web pages 

26 from a geographical perspective our total net revenue for the fiscal years ended march 31 2005 and 2004 was as follows in millions 

 

 for fiscal 2005 net revenue in north america increased by 34 percent as compared to fiscal 2004 from a franchise perspective the net revenue increase was primarily due to higher sales of products in our need for speed franchise the net revenue increase was also driven by sales of titles in our fight night and burnout franchises neither of which had corresponding titles released in the prior fiscal year together these items resulted in a net revenue increase of 180 million during the fiscal year ended march 31 2005 as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2004 this increase was partially offset by lower sales of products in our medal of honor ssx and lord of the rings franchises which reduced net revenue by 135 million in the fiscal year ended march 31 2005 as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2004 as part of this overall increase in net revenue we benefited from the launch of the nintendo ds and sony psp in november 2004 and march 2005 respectively 

 for fiscal 2005 net revenue in europe increased by 88 percent as compared to fiscal 2004 we estimate foreign exchange rates primarily the euro and the british pound sterling strengthened reported european net revenue by approximately 86 million or 7 percent for the fiscal year ended march 31 2005 excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates we estimate that european net revenue increased by approximately 18 million or 2 percent for the year ended march 31 2005 from a franchise perspective the net revenue increase was primarily due to 1 higher sales of products in our need for speed and the sims franchises 2 sales of products in our burnout franchise which did not have a corresponding title release in the prior fiscal year and 3 sales of uefa euro 2004  which was released during the three months ended june 30 2004 in conjunction with the uefa euro 2004 football tournament held in europe together these items resulted in a net revenue increase of 241 million during the fiscal year ended march 31 2005 as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2004 this increase was partially offset by lower sales of products in our medal of honor final fantasy ssx and lord of the rings franchises which reduced net revenue by 143 million in the fiscal year ended march 31 2005 as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2004 

 for fiscal 2005 net revenue from sales in asia pacific increased by 76 percent as compared to fiscal 2004 the increase in net revenue was driven primarily by higher sales of products in our need for speed franchise and sales of products in our burnout franchise which did not have a corresponding title release in the prior fiscal year partially offset by declines in our medal of honor franchise we estimate foreign exchange rates strengthened reported asia pacific net revenue by approximately 9 million or 5 percent for the fiscal year ended march 31 2005 excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates we estimate that asia pacific net revenue increased by approximately 4 million or 3 percent for the fiscal year ended march 31 2005 

27 our total net revenue by product line for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 was as follows in millions 

 

 net revenue from playstation 2 products increased from 1315 million in fiscal 2004 to 1330 million in fiscal 2005 as a percentage of total net revenue sales of playstation 2 products decreased by 19 percent in fiscal 2005 

 net revenue from xbox products increased from 384 million in fiscal 2004 to 516 million in fiscal 2005 as a percentage of total net revenue sales of xbox products increased by 35 percent in fiscal 2005 the increase in net revenue was primarily due to the continued growth in the xbox installed base driven by microsoft’s price reductions in the us in march 2004 and in europe in august 2004 as well as the overall greater demand for our products 

 net revenue from nintendo gamecube products increased from 200 million in fiscal 2004 to 212 million in fiscal 2005 the increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth in the installed base of the nintendo gamecube 

 net revenue from pcbased products increased from 470 million in fiscal 2004 to 531 million in fiscal 2005 as a percentage of total net revenue sales of pc products increased by 11 percent in fiscal 2005 the increase 

28 in pc net revenue was primarily due to higher sales of products in the sims lord of the rings and need for speed franchises partially offset by a decrease in sales of products in our command and conquer and simcity franchises 

 net revenue from mobile products increased from 78 million in fiscal 2004 to 118 million in fiscal 2005 mobile products include all mobile devices such as handhelds and cellular handsets the increase in mobility net revenue was primarily due to the release of titles in conjunction with the launch of the nintendo ds and psp platforms in north america and japan 

 in fiscal 2005 net revenue from copublishing and distribution products decreased by 115 million to 283 million as compared to fiscal 2004 the decrease was primarily due to a significant decrease in the number of copublishing and distribution titles we released in fiscal 2005 we released six copublishing titles in fiscal 2005 as compared to 11 titles in fiscal 2004 

 in fiscal 2005 net revenue from subscription services products increased by 6 million to 55 million as compared to fiscal 2004 the increase in net revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of paying subscribers to club pogo partially offset by a decrease in subscription net revenue from earth  beyond tm and the sims tm online subscription services 

 in fiscal 2005 net revenue from licensing advertising and other products increased by 41 million to 74 million as compared to fiscal 2004 the increase was primarily due to licensing revenue related to the nokia ngage platform

costs of goods sold for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 were in millions 

 in fiscal 2005 cost of goods sold as a percentage of total net revenue increased 09 percent from 373 percent to 382 percent as a percentage of total net revenue the increase was primarily due to a 23 percent increase for 1 pricing actions taken in both north america and europe due to higher than anticipated channel inventory 2 inventoryrelated costs due to nonrecurring rebates across several titles and 3 incremental costs incurred to produce our titles for the nintendo ds and sony psp in addition warranty and online costs increased by 08 percent 

29 offsetting these increases was a decrease of 22 percent primarily the result of lower copublishing and distribution royalties due to the lower mix of copublishing and distribution net revenue during the year ended march 31 2005 as compared to the year ended march 31 2004 

we expect cost of goods sold as a percentage of total net revenue to remain flat during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 we expect margin pressure as a result of a decrease in average selling prices as currentgeneration platforms mature and our industry transitions to nextgeneration technology and higher license royalty rates although there can be no assurance and our actual results could differ materially we expect this pressure to be essentially offset by lower manufacturing royalty rates lower outside development expense and to some extent product mix 

marketing and sales

 research and development expenses increased by 240 percent or 29 percent of net revenue in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to 

 we expect research and development spending to continue to increase in total dollars and as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2006 as we continue to invest in nextgeneration tools and technologies products for new platforms and to a lesser extent as we increase spending on titles for the pc and currentgeneration console products 

acquired inprocess technology

31 interest and other income net 

interest and other income net for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 was in millions 

 interest and other income net in fiscal 2005 increased from fiscal 2004 primarily due to 

 income taxes 

income taxes for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 were in millions 

 our effective income tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from significant operations outside the us which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate of 35 percent the effective income tax rate was 305 percent for fiscal 2005 and 275 percent for fiscal 2004 our increased effective income tax rate in fiscal 2005 primarily reflects the fact that we resolved certain taxrelated matters with the internal revenue service during fiscal 2004 which lowered our fiscal 2004 income tax expense by approximately 20 million and resulted in a 25 percent rate reduction additionally adjustments related to certain tax audit developments a change in valuation allowance and nondeductible acquisitionrelated costs partially offset by the geographic mix of taxable income subject to lower tax rates for fiscal 2005 increased our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2005 

we currently intend to indefinitely reinvest our accumulated foreign earnings outside the united states and accordingly have not provided for us taxes that would be incurred if such earnings were repatriated back to the us undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately 896 million as of march 31 2005 

our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2006 and future periods will depend on a variety of factors for example changes in our business including acquisitions changes in our international structure changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets changes in the geographic mix of income as well as changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities valuation allowances applicable accounting rules applicable tax laws and regulations rulings and interpretations thereof developments in tax audit and other matters and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate for future fiscal years in addition we may incur additional tax expense to the extent we undertake certain international restructurings that we are considering 

the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “jobs act” enacted on october 22 2004 provides for a temporary 85 percent dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated in fiscal 2005 or fiscal 2006 the deduction would result in an approximate 525 percent federal tax on a portion of the foreign earnings repatriated state local and foreign taxes could apply as well to qualify for this federal tax deduction the earnings must be reinvested in the united states pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by our chief executive officer and approved by the board of directors certain other criteria in the jobs act must be satisfied as well the maximum amount of our foreign earnings that we may repatriate subject to the jobs act deduction is 500 million 

we historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no us taxes have been provided thereon as a result of the jobs act we are in the process 

32 of evaluating whether we will change our intentions regarding a portion of our foreign earnings and take advantage of the repatriation provisions of the jobs act and if so the amount that we would repatriate we may not take advantage of the new law at all in addition to not having made a decision to repatriate any foreign earnings we are not yet in a position to accurately determine the impact of a qualifying repatriation should we choose to make one on our income tax expense for fiscal 2006 if we decide to repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings we would be required to recognize income tax expense related to the federal state local and foreign taxes that we would incur on the repatriated earnings when the decision is made we estimate that the reasonably possible amount of the income tax expense could be up to 35 million we expect to be in a position to finalize our analysis no later than february 2006 

net income 

net income for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 was in millions 

 reported net income decreased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to growth in our expenses especially research and development as we prepared for the adoption of nextgeneration technology within our industry while at the same time we continued to devote resources to the development of products for currentgeneration consoles

 for fiscal 2004 net revenue from sales in our asia pacific region remained flat as compared to fiscal 2003 although there were net revenue increases from our need for speed the sims and other franchises these increases were offset by declines in the sales of products in our harry potter world cup and final fantasy franchises we estimate foreign exchange rates strengthened reported asia pacific net revenue by approximately 21 million or 124 percent for the year ended march 31 2004 excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates we estimate that asia pacific net revenue decreased by approximately 21 million or 126 percent for the year ended march 31 2004

 in fiscal 2004 net revenue from subscription services products increased by 4 million to 49 million as compared to fiscal 2003 the increase in net revenue was primarily due to the number of subscribers to club pogo launched in july 2003 and purchasers of pogo downloadables launched in may 2003 partially offset by a decrease in subscription net revenue from the sims tm online  ultima online tm  and earth  beyond tm subscription services 

 in fiscal 2004 net revenue from licensing advertising and other products decreased by 17 million to 33 million as compared to fiscal 2003 the decrease was a result of expected declines in our advertising and programming net revenue following our renegotiation of the terms of our relationship with aol during the three months ended june 30 2003 

operations by segment 

in march 2003 we consolidated the operations of the eacom business segment into our core business because we began to consider online capability and gameplay as integral to our existing and future products accordingly beginning april 1 2003 we no longer managed our online products and services as a separate business segment and we consolidated the reporting related to our online products and services into reporting for the overall development and publication of our core products for all reporting periods ending after that date this change better reflected the way in which our chief executive officer our chief operating decision maker reviews and manages our business and reflects the importance of our online products and services relative to the rest of our business concurrently we eliminated separate reporting for our class b common stock for all reporting periods ending after april 1 2003 fiscal 2003 has been restated to conform with fiscal 2004 presentation see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report

 in fiscal 2004 cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 59 percentage points to 373 percent from 432 percent for fiscal 2003 primarily due to a 33 percent decrease in product costs and a 28 percent decrease in royalty rates

marketing and sales expenses for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 were in millions 

 marketing and sales expenses increased by 114 percent in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to

37 as a percentage of net revenue marketing and sales expenses declined from 134 percent in fiscal 2003 to 125 percent in fiscal 2004 marketing and sales expenses included vendor reimbursements for advertising expenses of 45 million in fiscal 2004 and 28 million in fiscal 2003

 general and administrative expenses increased by 412 percent or 10 percent of net revenue in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to

research and development expenses for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 were in millions 

 research and development expenses increased by 274 percent or 12 percentage points of net revenue in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to

amortization of intangibles 

amortization of intangibles for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 was in millions 

 amortization of intangibles resulted primarily from our acquisitions of westwood kesmai dreamworks interactive abc software pogo and other acquisitions the decline in amortization was a result of the impairment charges taken in fiscal 2003 

38 restructuring and asset impairment charges 

restructuring and asset impairment charges for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 were in millions 

 

 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we closed the majority of our leased studio facility in walnut creek california and our entire owned studio facility in austin texas in order to consolidate local development efforts in redwood city california we recorded total pretax charges of 9 million consisting of 7 million for consolidation of facilities net of expected future sublease income 2 million for workforce reductions of approximately 117 personnel and less than 1 million for the writeoff of noncurrent assets primarily leasehold improvements 

 during the third quarter of fiscal 2003 we closed our office located in san francisco california and our studio located in seattle washington in order to consolidate local development efforts in redwood city california and vancouver british columbia canada we recorded total pretax charges of 9 million consisting of 7 million for consolidation of facilities net of expected future sublease income 1 million for the writeoff of noncurrent assets primarily leasehold improvements and 1 million for workforce reductions of approximately 33 personnel 

additionally during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we approved a plan to consolidate the los angeles california irvine california and las vegas nevada studios into one major game studio in los angeles we recorded a total pretax restructuring charge of 5 million including 2 million for the shutdown of facilities and associated costs 2 million for the writeoff of noncurrent assets primarily leasehold improvements and 1 million for workforce reductions 

 in march 2003 we consolidated the operations of eacom into our core business and eliminated separate reporting for our class b common stock for all future reporting periods after fiscal 2003 we recorded restructuring charges including asset impairment of 67 million consisting of 2 million for workforce reductions of approximately 50 personnel 2 million for consolidation of facilities and 63 million for the writeoff of noncurrent assets the consolidation of facilities resulted in the closure of eacom’s chicago and virginia facilities and an adjustment for the closure of eacom’s san diego studio in fiscal 2002 

as part of the restructuring efforts we performed impairment tests under sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets”  to evaluate the recoverability of our longlived assets and remaining finitelived identifiable intangible assets utilized in the eacom business this test was performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 in conjunction with the overall valuation of the eacom legal entity and its class b common stock as of march 31 2003 the unit sales and the number of subscribers for the sims online our flagship eacom product and overall eacom performance were significantly below our expectations which we considered to be a triggering event under sfas no 144 these results caused us to cancel most of our plans to develop similar online products that would have utilized the longlived assets associated with the eacom business impairment charges on longlived assets amounted to 63 million and included 25 million relating to impaired customized internaluse software systems for the eacom infrastructure 26 million for other longlived assets and 12 million of finitelived intangibles impairment charges relating to eacom’s acquisitions of kesmai corporation and pogo corporation

interest and other income net 

interest and other income net for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 was in millions 

 interest and other income net in fiscal 2004 increased from fiscal 2003 primarily due to the following 

 40 income taxes 

income taxes for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 were in millions 

 our effective income tax rate reflected tax benefits derived from significant operations outside the us which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate of 35 percent the effective income tax rate was 275 percent for fiscal 2004 and 310 percent for fiscal 2003 the reduced effective income tax rate in fiscal 2004 primarily reflected the resolution of certain taxrelated matters with the internal revenue service in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 which lowered our income tax expense by 20 million and resulted in a 25 percent rate reduction and also reflected a change in the geographic mix of taxable income subject to lower tax rates 

net income 

net income for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 was in millions 

 reported net income increased in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to the reasons discussed above although the dollar amount of our expenses increased in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 net income as a percentage of net revenue increased to 195 percent as compared to 128 percent in fiscal 2003 as expenses including our cost of goods sold grew at a slower rate than did our net revenue 

 in march 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” ratified the otherthantemporary impairment measurement and recognition guidance and certain disclosure requirements for impaired securities as described in eitf issue no 031 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments”  in september 2004 the fasb issued a proposed staff position “fsp” eitf issue no 031a “implementation guidance for the application of paragraph 16 of eitf 031 ” the proposed fsp will provide measurement and recognition guidance with respect to debt securities that are impaired solely due to interest rates andor sector spreads in october 2004 the fasb delayed the effective date for the otherthantemporary impairment measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 1020 of eitf issue no 031 until fsp issue no 031a is issued however this delay does not suspend the requirement to recognize otherthantemporary impairments as required by existing authoritative literature nor does it delay the required disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as otherthantemporary impairments in paragraphs 2122 of eitf issue no 031 see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements management is unable to determine what impact the adoption of the measurement and recognition guidance in eitf issue no 031 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs — an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4”  sfas no 151 amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin “arb” no 43 chapter 4 “inventory pricing”  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage and requires that those items be recognized as currentperiod charges sfas no 151 also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities sfas no 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 management believes the adoption of sfas no 151 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 “exchange of nonmonetary assets — an amendment of apb opinion no 29”  sfas no 153 amends accounting principles board “apb” no 29 “accounting 

41 for nonmonetary transactions”  to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance sfas no 153 is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 management believes the adoption of sfas no 153 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sfas no 123r” “sharebased payment”  sfas no 123r requires that the cost resulting from all sharebased payment transactions be recognized in financial statements using a fairvaluebased method the statement replaces sfas no 123 supersedes apb no 25 and amends sfas no 95 “statement of cash flows”  while the fair value method under sfas no 123r is very similar to the fair value method under sfas no 123 with regards to measurement and recognition of stockbased compensation management is currently evaluating the impact of several of the key differences between the two standards on our consolidated financial statements for example sfas no 123 permits us to recognize forfeitures as they occur while sfas no 123r will require us to estimate future forfeitures and adjust our estimate on a quarterly basis sfas no 123r also will require a classification change in the statement of cash flows whereby a portion of the tax benefit from stock options will move from operating cash flow activities to financing cash flow activities total cash flows will remain unchanged 

in march 2005 the securities and exchange commission “sec” released sab no 107 “sharebased payment”  which provides the views of the staff regarding the interaction between sfas no 123r and certain sec rules and regulations for public companies in april 2005 the sec adopted a rule that amends the compliance dates of sfas no 123r under the revised compliance dates we will be required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 123r no later than the first interim period of fiscal 2007 while management continues to evaluate the impact of sfas no 123r on our consolidated financial statements we currently believe that the expensing of stockbased compensation will have an impact on our consolidated statements of operations similar to our pro forma disclosure under sfas no 123 as amended 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

 during the year ended march 31 2005 we generated 634 million of cash from operating activities as compared to 669 million for the year ended march 31 2004 this decline was primarily the result of 1 our 

42 overall decline in net income for fiscal 2005 2 higher accounts receivable balances due to the timing of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and 3 higher cash payments for income taxes these declines were partially offset by higher balances in our current liabilities we expect to continue to generate significant operating cash flow in fiscal 2006 for the year ended march 31 2005 our primary use of cash in nonoperating activities consisted of net purchases of 1446 million in shortterm investments 126 million in capital expenditures primarily related to the expansions of our los angeles and vancouver studios as well as upgrades to our worldwide erp systems 90 million for our purchase of a 199 percent investment in ubisoft 81 million for our acquisitions of 100 percent of criterion and an additional 44 percent of dice and 41 million towards the repurchase and retirement of our common stock these nonoperating expenditures were partially offset by 241 million in proceeds from the sale of our common stock through stock plans and 16 million in proceeds from the sale of property during the year ended march 31 2005 we anticipate making continued capital investments in our vancouver studio during fiscal 2006 as well as completing the remaining 709 million of our 750 million share repurchase program by september 30 2005 

 the composition of our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments changed from primarily cash equivalents which were 1991 billion as of march 31 2004 to primarily shortterm investments which were 1688 billion as of march 31 2005 and therefore our portfolio is more susceptible to changes in shortterm interest rates as of march 31 2005 our shortterm investments had gross unrealized losses of approximately 22 million or 13 percent of the total in shortterm investments from timetotime we may liquidate some or all of our shortterm investments to fund operational needs or other activities such as capital expenditures business acquisitions or stock repurchase programs depending on the shortterm investments that we liquidate to fund these activities we could recognize a portion of the gross unrealized losses 

marketable equity securities increased to 140 million as of march 31 2005 from 1 million as of march 31 2004 primarily due to our purchase of a 199 percent investment in ubisoft entertainment 

 our gross accounts receivable balance was 458 million and 367 million as of march 31 2005 and march 31 2004 respectively the increase in our accounts receivable balance was primarily due to an increase in our fourth quarter gross sales prior to reserve adjustments versus the prior year and the timing of those sales which occurred later in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 than in the prior year we expect to collect a substantial portion of these amounts in the three months ended june 30 2005 reserves for sales returns pricing allowances and doubtful accounts increased from 155 million as of march 31 2004 to 162 million as of march 31 2005 both the sales return and price protection reserves increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of trailing six month net revenue and remained relatively flat as a percentage of trailing nine month net revenue as of march 31 2005 we believe these reserves are adequate based on historical experience and our current estimate of potential returns and allowances 

 inventories increased to 62 million as of march 31 2005 from 55 million as of march 31 2004 primarily due to overall growth in europe we typically have a higher inventory balance as a percentage of net revenue on hand in europe than in north america due to the need to provide multiple language versions of each title in that region no single title represented more than 4 million of inventory as of march 31 2005 

 other current assets increased to 164 million as of march 31 2005 from 163 million as of march 31 2004 primarily due to the amortization of certain prepaid amounts and collections of advertising credits owed to us by our suppliers offset by higher prepaid royalties as we continue to invest in our product development 

 accounts payable increased to 134 million as of march 31 2005 from 114 million as of march 31 2004 primarily due to higher gross sales volumes and an extension of payment terms with our vendors in fiscal 2005 

 our accrued and other liabilities increased to 694 million as of march 31 2005 from 630 million as of march 31 2004 the increase was due to increases in income taxes payable accruals for pending litigation and increases to our deferred rent and deferred revenue offset by a decrease in royalties payable and accrued payroll and related expenses we anticipate our accrued and other liabilities balance will decline following our bonus payments during the three months ended june 30 2005 

 we believe that existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments marketable equity securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months including working capital requirements capital expenditures potential future acquisitions or strategic investments and funding of our stock repurchase program we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position facilitate expansion pursue strategic investments or to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise there can be no guarantee that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms if at all or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 

our two lease agreements with keybank national association described in the “offbalance sheet commitments” section below are scheduled to expire in june 2006 and july 2006 we currently are evaluating whether to extend the leases purchase the properties under lease or identify a third party buyer for the properties when the leases expire should we choose to renew the leases we would not expect a material change in our lease payments from the amounts under the current lease agreements should we choose to purchase the properties we could incur a cash outflow of at least 200 million we have not yet determined the course of action that we will take 

a portion of our cash that was generated from operations domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions approximately 987 million as of march 31 2005 is designated as indefinitely reinvested in the respective tax jurisdiction while we have no plans to repatriate these funds to the united states in the shortterm if we were required to do so in order to fund our operations in the united states we would accrue and pay additional taxes in connection with their repatriation we are in the process of evaluating whether we will repatriate foreign earnings under the repatriation provisions of the jobs act 

on october 18 2004 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to an aggregate of 750 million of shares of our common stock pursuant to the authorization we may repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions over the course of a twelvemonth period during the year ended march 31 2005 we repurchased and retired 805500 shares of our common stock for approximately 41 million 

we have a “shelf” registration statement on form s3 on file with the securities and exchange commission this shelf registration statement which includes a base prospectus allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings up to a total amount of 20 billion unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus we will use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes including for working capital financing capital expenditures research and development marketing and distribution efforts and if opportunities arise for acquisitions or strategic alliances pending such uses we may invest the net proceeds in interestbearing securities in addition we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time 

our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those related to customer demand and acceptance of our titles on new platforms and new 

44 versions of our titles on existing platforms our ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due successfully achieving our product release schedules and attaining our forecasted sales objectives the impact of competition the economic conditions in the domestic and international markets seasonality in operating results risks of product returns and the other risks described in the “risk factors” section below

45 the following table summarizes our minimum contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of march 31 2005 and the effect we expect them to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions

46 offbalance sheet commitments 

lease commitments 

we lease certain of our current facilities and certain equipment under noncancelable operating lease agreements we are required to pay property taxes insurance and normal maintenance costs for certain of our facilities and will be required to pay any increases over the base year of these expenses on the remainder of our facilities 

in february 1995 we entered into a buildtosuit lease with a third party for our headquarters facility in redwood city california which was refinanced with keybank national association in july 2001 and expires in july 2006 we accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with sfas no 13 “accounting for leases”  as amended existing campus facilities developed in phase one comprise a total of 350000 square feet and provide space for sales marketing administration and research and development functions we have an option to purchase the property land and facilities for a maximum of 145 million or at the end of the lease to arrange for i an extension of the lease or ii sale of the property to a third party while we retain an obligation to the owner for approximately 90 percent of the difference between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up to 129 million if the sales price is less than this amount subject to certain provisions of the lease

on march 24 2005 a purported class action lawsuit was filed against us and certain of our officers and directors the complaint which asserts claims under section 10b and 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 based on allegedly false and misleading statements was filed in the united states district court northern district of california by an individual purporting to represent a class of purchasers of ea common stock additional purported class action lawsuits have been filed in the same court by other individuals asserting the same claims against us we have not yet responded to any of the complaints in addition on april 12 2005 a shareholder derivative action was filed against certain of our officers and directors this suit asserts claims based on substantially the same factual allegations set forth in the federal class action lawsuits the complaint was filed in san mateo superior court on april 13 2005 a second shareholder derivative action was filed in san mateo superior court based on the same claims as the first complaint on may 16 2005 a shareholder derivative action based on substantially the same allegations was filed in the united states district court northern district of california we have not responded to the shareholder derivative complaints 

in addition we are subject to other claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business our management considers that any liability from any reasonably foreseeable disposition of such other claims and litigation individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

director indemnity agreements 

we have entered into indemnification agreement with the members of our board of directors to indemnify them to the extent permitted by law against any and all liabilities costs expenses amounts paid in settlement 

48 and damages incurred by the directors as a result of any lawsuit or any judicial administrative or investigative proceeding in which the directors are sued as a result of their service as members of our board of directors 

inflation 

we believe the impact of inflation on our results of operations has not been significant for each of the past three fiscal years 

risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs our business and financial performance could be harmed our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our securities could decline the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may harm our business and financial performance 

 we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play on video game platforms manufactured by third parties such as sony’s playstation 2 and microsoft’s xbox the success of our business is driven in large part by the availability of an adequate supply of currentgeneration video game platforms the timely release and success of new video game hardware systems our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be most successful in the marketplace and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of a new platform a new platform for which we are developing products may be delayed may not succeed or may have a shorter life cycle than anticipated if the platforms for which we are developing products are not released when anticipated are not available in adequate amounts to meet consumer demand or do not attain wide market acceptance our revenue will suffer we may be unable to fully recover the resources we have committed and our financial performance will be harmed 

 video game platforms have historically had a life cycle of four to six years which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well sony’s playstation 2 was introduced in 2000 and microsoft’s xbox and the nintendo gamecube were introduced in 2001 over the course of the next eighteen months we expect sony microsoft and nintendo to introduce new video game platforms into the market socalled “nextgeneration platforms” as a result we believe that the interactive entertainment industry has entered into a transition stage leading into the next cycle during this transition we intend to continue developing new titles for the currentgeneration of video game platforms while we also make significant investments preparing to introduce products upon the launch of the nextgeneration platforms we have and expect to continue to incur increased costs during the transition to nextgeneration platforms which are not likely to be offset in the near future we also expect development costs for nextgeneration video games to be greater on a pertitle basis than development costs for currentgeneration video games further we expect that as the currentgeneration of platforms reaches the end of its cycle and nextgeneration platforms are introduced into the market sales of video games for currentgeneration consoles may begin to decline consumers may defer game software purchases until the nextgeneration platforms become available this decline may not be offset by increased sales of products for the new platforms for example following the launch of sony’s playstation 2 platform we experienced a significant decline in revenue from sales of products for sony’s older playstation game console which was not immediately offset by revenue generated from sales of products for the playstation 2 

49 platform if the increased costs we have incurred and expect to continue to incur are not offset during the transition our operating results will suffer and our financial position will be harmed in addition during this transition we expect our operating results to be more volatile and difficult to predict which could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly 

 in the next eighteen months we expect our platform licensors to introduce new video game platforms into the market for example microsoft and sony have indicated that they plan to release nextgeneration successors to the xbox and playstation 2 respectively over the course of the next eighteen months in order to publish products for a new game machine we must take a license from the platform licensor which gives the platform licensor the opportunity to set the fee structure that we must pay in order to publish games for that platform similarly certain platform licensors have retained the flexibility to change their fee structures for online gameplay and features for their consoles the control that platform licensors have over the fee structures for their future platforms and online access makes it difficult for us to predict our costs and profitability in the medium to long term it is also possible that platform licensors will not renew our licenses because publishing products for video game consoles is the largest portion of our business any increase in fee structures or failure to secure a license relationship would significantly harm our ability to generate revenues andor profits 

 our business is highly seasonal with the highest levels of consumer demand and a significant percentage of our revenue occurring in the december quarter in addition we seek to release many of our products in conjunction with specific events such as the release of a related movie or the beginning of a sports season or major sporting event if we miss these key selling periods due to product delays or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have developed products our sales will suffer disproportionately our ability to meet product development schedules is affected by a number of factors including the creative processes involved the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams required by the increasing complexity of our products and the need to refine and tune our products prior to their release we have in the past experienced development delays for several of our products failure to meet anticipated production or “go live” schedules may cause a shortfall in our revenue and profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different from expectations 

 as a result of a more valueoriented consumer base caused by price reductions in currentgeneration platforms by microsoft sony and nintendo a greater number of currentgeneration titles being published and significant pricing pressure from our competitors we have experienced a decrease in the average price of our titles for currentgeneration platforms although we believe that a few of the most popular currentgeneration titles will continue to be launched at premium price points as the interactive entertainment industry transitions to nextgeneration video game platforms we expect there to be fewer currentgeneration titles able to command premium price points and we expect that even these titles will be subject to price reductions at an earlier point in their sales cycle than we have seen in prior years we expect the average price of currentgeneration titles to continue to decline which will have a negative effect on our margins and operating results 

 rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate sometimes years in advance which technologies we must implement and take advantage of in order to make our products and services competitive in the market therefore we usually start our product development with a range of technical 

50 development goals that we hope to be able to achieve we may not be able to achieve these goals or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly than we can in either case our products and services may be technologically inferior to our competitors’ less appealing to consumers or both if we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule of our products and services then we may delay their release until these technology goals can be achieved which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses alternatively we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies either to preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up with our competition which would increase our development expenses 

 competition in our industry is intense and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge while many new products are regularly introduced only a relatively small number of “hit” titles accounts for a significant portion of net revenue hit products published by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause our product sales to fall below our expectations if our competitors develop more successful products offer competitive products at lower price points or if we do not continue to develop consistently highquality and wellreceived products our revenue margins and profitability will decline 

 many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our ea sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players’ associations similarly many of our hit ea games tm franchises such as bond harry potter and lord of the rings are based on key film and literary licenses competition for these licenses is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses and obtain additional licenses with significant commercial value our revenues and profitability will decline significantly competition for these licenses may also drive up the advances guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor which could significantly increase our costs 

 many patents have been issued that may apply to widelyused game technologies additionally infringement claims under many recently issued patents are now being asserted against internet implementations of existing games several such claims have been asserted against us such claims can harm our business we incur substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims regardless of the merits of the claims in the event that there is a determination that we have infringed a thirdparty patent we could incur significant monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future which could negatively impact our operating results 

 many of our products include extremely realistic graphical images and we expect that as technology continues to advance images will become even more realistic some of the images and other content are based on realworld examples that may inadvertently infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement from time to time we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims existing or future infringement claims against us whether valid or not may be time consuming and expensive to defend such claims or litigations could require us to stop selling the affected products redesign those products to avoid infringement or obtain a license all of which would be costly and harm our business 

 we are currently and from time to time in the future may become subject to other claims and litigation which could be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations in addition the outcome of any claims or litigation may be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for further information regarding certain claims and litigation in which we are currently involved see “part i — item 3 legal proceedings” above 

 legislation is continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution for example privacy laws in the united states and europe impose various restrictions on our web sites those rules vary by territory although the internet recognizes no geographical boundaries other countries such as germany have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged goods and those transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current united states laws in the united states the federal and several state governments are considering content restrictions on products such as ours as well as restrictions on distribution of such products any one or more of these factors could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers and by requiring additional differentiation between products for different territories to address varying regulations this additional product differentiation would be costly 

 the market for technical creative marketing and other personnel essential to the development and marketing of our products and management of our businesses is extremely competitive our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of executives and key creative talent if we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need or replace key employees following their departure our ability to develop and manage our businesses will be impaired 

we annually review and evaluate with the compensation committee of our board of directors the compensation and benefits that we offer our employees to ensure that we are able to attract and retain our talent within our regular review we have considered recent changes in the accounting treatment of stock options the competitive market for technical creative marketing and other personnel and the evolving nature of job functions within our studios marketing organizations and other areas of the business any changes we make to our compensation programs could result in increased expenses and have a significant impact on our operating results 

 our agreements with hardware licensors such as sony for the playstation 2 microsoft for the xbox and nintendo for the nintendo gamecube typically give significant control to the licensor over the approval and manufacturing of our products which could in certain circumstances leave us unable to get our products approved manufactured and shipped to customers these hardware licensors are also our chief competitors in most events control of the approval and manufacturing process by the platform licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently while we believe that our relationships with our hardware licensors are currently good the potential for these licensors to delay or refuse to approve or manufacture our products exists such occurrences would harm our business and our financial performance 

we also require compatibility code and the consent of microsoft and sony in order to include online capabilities in our products for their respective platforms as online capabilities for video game platforms 

52 become more significant microsoft and sony could restrict our ability to provide online capabilities for our console platform products if microsoft or sony refused to approve our products with online capabilities or significantly impacted the financial terms on which these services are offered to our customers our business could be harmed 

 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2005 international net revenue comprised 47 percent of our total net revenue we expect foreign sales to continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue such sales are subject to unexpected regulatory requirements tariffs and other barriers additionally foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies which may fluctuate against the us dollar while we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate some foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities primarily certain intercompany receivables and payables and from time to time foreign currency option contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions primarily related to a portion of the revenue generated by our operational subsidiaries our results of operations including our reported net revenue and net income and financial condition would be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations particularly the euro and pound sterling 

 we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are also required to estimate what our taxes will be in the future although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the estimate process is inherently uncertain and our estimates are not binding on tax authorities our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in our business including the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the elections we make changes in applicable tax laws as well as other factors further our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should our ultimate tax liability exceed our estimates our income tax provision and net income could be materially affected 

we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under examination by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations changes in our business or changes in applicable tax rules will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

 we are in the process of examining our worldwide operating structure in light of changing tax laws our current and anticipated business operations and the pending expiration of an offshore advance pricing agreements with a foreign tax authority in december 2005 under which our current business operates certain changes that we are considering or a failure to make certain other changes to our operating structure would increase our tax expense 

in addition while our current intention is to invest indefinitely our undistributed foreign earnings offshore we are in the process of evaluating whether we will change our intentions regarding a portion of our foreign earnings and take advantage of the repatriation provision of the jobs act and if so the amount that we would intend to repatriate we may decide not to take advantage of the new law at all in addition to not having made a decision to repatriate any foreign earnings we are not yet in a position to determine the impact of a qualifying repatriation should we choose to make one on our income tax expense for fiscal 2006 

 as a result of the enactment of the sarbanesoxley act and the review of accounting policies by the sec and national and international accounting standards bodies the frequency of accounting policy changes may accelerate for example the fasb has issued a new standard that will require us to adopt a different method of determining and accounting for the compensation expense of our employee stock options this and other possible changes to accounting standards could adversely affect our reported results of operations although not necessarily our cash flows further accounting policies affecting software revenue recognition have been the subject of frequent interpretations which could significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

 in the us in fiscal 2005 over 80 percent of our us sales were made to six key customers two of which have recently announced plans to merge in europe our top ten customers accounted for over 30 percent of our sales in that territory in fiscal 2005 worldwide we had direct sales to one customer walmart stores inc which represented 14 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2005 though our products are available to consumers through a variety of retailers the concentration of our sales in one or a few large customers could lead to a shortterm disruption in our sales if one or more of these customers significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to carry our products and could make us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers became unable to pay for our products additionally our receivables from these large customers increase significantly in the december quarter as they stock up for the holiday selling season also having such a large portion of our total net revenue concentrated in a few customers reduces our negotiating leverage with these customers 

 we have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions including 1 acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets and 2 investments in new interactive entertainment businesses for example online and mobile games any of these strategic transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations although we regularly search for opportunities to engage in strategic transactions we may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities we may not be able to consummate potential acquisitions or investments or an acquisition or investment may not enhance our business or may decrease rather than increase our earnings in addition the process of integrating an acquired company or business or successfully exploiting acquired intellectual property or other assets could divert a significant amount of our management’s time and focus and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures additional risks we face include 

 54 future acquisitions and investments could involve the issuance of our equity securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or writeoffs of goodwill any of which could harm our financial condition our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

 in many countries around the world more pirated copies of our products are sold than legitimate copies though piracy has not had a material impact on our operating results to date highly organized pirate operations have been expanding globally in addition the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures we use in our products the availability of broadband access to the internet the ability to download pirated copies of our games from various internet sites and the widespread proliferation of internet cafes using pirated copies of our products all have contributed to ongoing and expanding piracy though we take steps to make the unauthorized copying and distribution of our products more difficult as do the manufacturers of consoles on which our games are played neither our efforts nor those of the console manufacturers may be successful in controlling the piracy of our products this could have a negative effect on our growth and profitability in the future 

 the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors above as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts’ earnings estimates to our results falling below the expectations of analysts and investors to factors affecting the computer software internet entertainment media or electronics industries or to national or international economic conditions

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market prices market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices foreign currency option and foreign exchange forward contracts are used to either hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to market risk we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements interest rate risk is the potential loss arising from changes in interest rates and credit ratings we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be exposed to significant interest rate risk because our portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

 from time to time we hedge some of our foreign currency risk related to anticipated foreigncurrencydenominated sales transactions by purchasing option contracts that generally have maturities of 15 months or less these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges the derivative assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of any tax effects in stockholders’ equity and subsequently reclassified into net revenue in the period when the forecasted transaction actually occurs the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value is reported in interest and other income net in the consolidated statements of operations our hedging programs reduce but do not entirely 

55 eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements the fair value of our foreign currency option contracts purchased and included in other current assets was 1 million as of both march 31 2005 and 2004 

we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities primarily intercompany receivables and payables the forward contracts generally have a contractual term of less than one month and are transacted near monthend therefore the fair value of the forward contracts generally is not significant at each monthend our foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 133 and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts are reported as other current assets or other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses from changes in fair value are reported in interest and other income net in the consolidated statements of operations the gains and losses on these forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying foreigncurrencydenominated assets and liabilities 

as of march 31 2005 we had foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell approximately 425 million of foreign currencies of this amount 379 million represents contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars 22 million to sell foreign currencies in exchange for british pounds and 24 million to purchase foreign currency in exchange for us dollars as of march 31 2004 we had foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell approximately 190 million of foreign currencies of this amount 173 million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and 17 million to sell foreign currency for british pounds the fair value of our forward contracts was approximately 0 and 2 million as of march 31 2005 and 2004 respectively 

the counterparties to these forward and option contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks the risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are not considered to be material 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurances that our mitigating activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations for example a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would not result in a material loss in fair value of our option contracts under either scenario as of march 31 2005 or 2004 a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would result in potential losses on our forward contracts of 40 million and 61 million respectively as of march 31 2005 and 17 million and 26 million respectively as of march 31 2004 this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift in foreign currency exchange rates which do not always move in the same direction actual results may differ materially 

 our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short average maturities additionally the contractual terms of the securities do not permit the issuer to call prepay or otherwise settle the securities at prices less that the stated par value of the securities we also do not use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio 

as of march 31 2005 and 2004 our shortterm investments were classified as availableforsale and consequently recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of any tax effects 

56 in stockholders’ equity our portfolio of shortterm investments consists of the following investment categories summarized by fair value as of march 31 2005 and 2004 in millions 

 notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations at any time a sharp rise in interest rates could have a significant adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value in our shortterm investment portfolio as of march 31 2005 arising from selected potential changes in interest rates the modeling technique measures the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps actual results may differ materially 

 during fiscal 2005 the composition of our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments changed significantly from mostly cash equivalents during fiscal 2004 to mostly shortterm investments during fiscal 2005 as illustrated above and is now more susceptible to changes in interest rates therefore we have changed our quantitative disclosures of interest rate risk from the tabular presentation used in prior years to the sensitivity analysis presented above as we believe this methodology better illustrates the effects on our portfolio caused by our primary risk of changes in interest rates we have not presented a similar sensitivity analysis for fiscal 2004 because of the relatively insignificant amount of shortterm investments in fiscal 2004 versus fiscal 2005 

 the values of our equity investments in publicly traded companies are subject to market price volatility as of march 31 2005 our marketable equity securities were classified as availableforsale and consequently were recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of any tax effects in stockholders’ equity the fair value of our marketable equity securities was 140 million and 1 million as of march 31 2005 and 2004 respectively 

57 at any time a sharp decrease in market prices in our investments in marketable equity securities could have a significant adverse impact on the fair value of our investments the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value in our marketable equity securities as of march 31 2005 arising from selected potential changes in market prices the modeling technique measures the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in market price plus or minus 25 percent 50 percent and 75 percent hypothetical changes in market prices of the same magnitude would not have resulted in material changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities as of march 31 2004 and accordingly are not presented

there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures these limitations include the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures and reasonable resource constraints in addition because we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions which we believe are reasonable about the likelihood of future events our system of controls may not achieve its desired purpose under all possible future conditions accordingly our disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance but not absolute assurance of achieving their objectives 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our chief executive officer and executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures believe that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing the requisite reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” 

our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting these limitations include the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of the system and reasonable resource constraints because of its inherent limitations our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate 

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our most recently completed fiscal year in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment our management believes that as of the end of our most recently completed fiscal year our internal control over financial reporting was effective 

100 kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting that report appears on page 99 

changes in internal controls 

in preparation for management’s report on internal control over financial reporting we documented and tested the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in connection with these efforts we implemented a number of enhancements to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended march 31 2005 including increased restrictions on access to our information technology systems and the documentation and augmentation of existing policies and procedures

2004 approximately 45 percent of our net revenue was generated by international operations compared to approximately 42 percent in fiscal 2003 and 37 percent in fiscal 2002 another strength of our business is that we have developed many of our products to become franchise titles that can be regularly iterated for example every year we release new versions of most of our ea sports titles likewise several of the ea games and ea sports big products listed above are part of new or continuing product franchises we also release products called “expansion packs” for pc titles that provide additional content characters storylines settings missions for games that we have previously published for example we have published expansion packs for battlefield 1942  including battlefield 1942 the road to rome and battlefield 1942 secret weapons of wwii each of which expands the characters settings and gameplay of the original battlefield 1942 game we consider titles that iterate sequel or spawn expansion packs to be franchise titles method of delivery the console pc and handheld games that we publish are made available to consumers on a disk usually cd or dvd format or a cartridge that is packaged and typically sold in retail stores and through our own online store we refer to these as packaged goods products in north america and europe our largest markets these packaged goods products are sold primarily to retailers that may be mass market retailers such as walmart electronics specialty stores such as best buy or game software specialty stores such as electronics boutique we also maintain a smaller business where we license to manufacturers of products in related industries for example makers of personal computers or computer accessories rights to include certain of our products with the manufacturer’s product or offer our products to consumers who have purchased the manufacturer’s product we call these combined products “oem bundles” there are three ways in which we publish games that are playable online by consumers first we include online capability features in certain of our pc and playstation 2 products and soon xbox which enable consumers to play against one another via the internet we also publish games that are playable only online one type of these onlineonly games is called “persistent state worlds” or massively multiplayer online games and is server based consumers experience these games as interactive virtual worlds where thousands of other consumers can interact with one another examples of our persistent state world products are ultima online tm and the sims online these persistent state world games are often sold to consumers in the form of a cd or dvd that contains much of the software necessary to play the game online other types of onlineonly games that we publish are available on the world wide web and include card games puzzle games and word games marketed under the “pogo” brand all of which are made available to consumers on our website wwwpogocom and on certain online services provided by america online inc 4 intellectual property like other entertainment companies our business is based on the creation acquisition exploitation and protection of intellectual property each of our products embodies a number of separately protected intellectual properties our products are copyrighted both as software and as audiovisual works our product names are trademarks of ours or others and our products may contain voices and likenesses of third parties or the musical compositions and performances of third

in our products through license agreements such as those with sports leagues and player associations movie studios and performing talent music labels music publishers and musicians these licenses are typically limited to use of the licensed rights in products for specific time periods in addition our products that play on videogame platforms such as the sony playstation 2 console include intellectual properties owned by the platform company and licensed nonexclusively to us for use while we may have renewal rights for some licenses our business and the justification for the development of many of our products is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain the intellectual property rights from third parties at reasonable rates our products are susceptible to unauthorized copying our primary protection against unauthorized use duplication and distribution of our products is copyright and trademark we typically own the copyright to the software code as well as the brand or title name trademark under which our products are marketed we register our copyrights in the united states and register our significant trademarks in multiple countries including the united states in addition console manufacturers such as sony typically incorporate security devices in their consoles in an effort to prevent unlicensed use of products market historically there have been multiple consoles available in our business segment and vigorous competition between console manufacturers while sony has for the past several years been the clear leader with its playstation and playstation 2 consoles microsoft and nintendo are large and viable competitors and pcs continue to be a strong interactive game platform we develop and publish products for multiple platforms and this diversification continues to be a cornerstone of our strategy the following table details select information on a sample of the console platforms for which we have published titles  we currently develop or publish products for ten different hardware platforms in fiscal 2004 our product releases were for playstation 2 xbox nintendo gamecube playstation pc game boy advance nokia ngage and online internet play our planned product introductions for fiscal 2005 are for the playstation 2 xbox nintendo gamecube playstation pc game boy advance nokia ngage sony psp nintendo dual screen and online internet play playstation 2 sony released the playstation 2 console in japan in march 2000 in north america in october 2000 and in europe in november 2000 the playstation 2 console is a 128bit dvdbased system 5 that with a network adaptor is internet ready as well as backward compatible with games published for its predecessor the playstation we have published and are currently developing numerous products for the sony playstation 2 

nintendo gamecube nintendo launched the nintendo gamecube console in japan in september 2001 north america in november 2001 and in europe in may 2002 the nintendo gamecube plays games that are manufactured on a proprietary optical disk we have published and are currently developing numerous products for the nintendo gamecube xbox microsoft launched the xbox console in north america in november 2001 in japan in february 2002 and in europe in march 2002 the microsoft xbox is a 128bit dvdbased system that is internet ready we have published and are currently developing numerous products for the microsoft xbox our early investment in products designed for play on 32bit pcs and consoles such as the playstation has been strategically important in positioning us for the current generation of 128bit machines we believe that such investment continues to be important during fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 the video and computer games industry experienced a platform transition from 32bit cdbased and 64bit cartridgebased consoles to the current generation of 128bit dvdbased game consoles and related software the transition to the current generation systems was initiated by the launch of sony’s playstation 2 in fiscal 2001 and continued with the launches of the nintendo gamecube and microsoft’s xbox in fiscal 2002 as consumers shifted to the current generation systems our sales of 32bit and 64bit products declined a trend we expect to continue in fiscal 2005 online games the online gaming component of our business is still in its early stages to date we have had limited success in finding ways of generating revenue and profits from online games including subscription fees “paytoplay” fees and advertising in addition we have had limited experience with developing optimal pricing strategies or predicting usage patterns for our online games in our history we have launched five persistent state world products with mixed results while we have achieved success with ultima online  our other persistent state world products most notably the sims online and earth  beyond   tm  have not met our expectations since the beginning of fiscal 2003 we have launched our free ea sports and ea games nation online offerings which can be accessed through certain of our pc and playstation 2 titles in fiscal 2004 we launched club pogo a subscription service for pogo offering exclusive games and premium features we had over 300000 paying subscribers as of march 31 2004 however the subscription fees to date have been immaterial the continued growth of the online sector of our industry will depend on the following key factors  competition we consider ourselves to be part of the entertainment industry at the most fundamental level our products compete with other forms of entertainment such as motion pictures television and music for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers we believe that large software companies and media companies are increasing their focus in the interactive entertainment software market and as a result stand to become more direct competitors several large software companies and media companies eg microsoft and sony are already established competitors in the software games segment and other diversified mediaentertainment companies eg time warner and disney have announced their intent to significantly expand their software game publishing efforts in the future therefore we believe that the software games segment is best viewed as a segment of the overall entertainment market 6 the software games business is highly competitive it is characterized by the continuous introduction of new titles and the development of new technologies our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large diversified corporations with greater financial and marketing resources than ours our business is driven by hit titles which requires us to invest significantly in production and in marketing therefore the availability of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in the software games segment primarily as a result of the costs associated with the development and marketing of game software competition in the software games segment is also based on product quality and features timing of product releases brandname recognition access to distribution channels effectiveness of marketing and price in the software games segment we compete with sony microsoft and nintendo each of which develop and publish software for their respective console platforms we also compete with numerous companies which are like us licensed by the console manufacturers to develop and publish software games that operate on their consoles these competitors include acclaim entertainment activision capcom eidos infogrames koei konami lucas arts midway namco sega square enix taketwo interactive thq ubi soft and vivendi universal games among others as discussed above diversified media companies such as time warner and disney have also indicated their intent to significantly expand their software game publishing efforts in the future in addition to competing for product sales we face heavy competition from other software game companies to obtain license agreements which allow us the right to use intellectual property included in our products and many of these content licenses are controlled by the diversified media companies many of which intend to expand their software game publishing divisions finally the market for our products is characterized by significant price competition and we regularly face pricing pressures from our competitors these pressures have from time to time required us to reduce our prices on certain products our experience has been that software game prices tend to decline once a generation of consoles has been in the market for a significant period of time due to the increasing number of software titles competing for acceptance by consumers and the anticipation of the next generation of consoles relationships with significant hardware platform companies sony under the terms of a licensing agreement we entered into with sony computer entertainment of america effective as of april 2000 and as subsequently amended we are authorized to develop and distribute dvdbased software products compatible with the playstation 2 pursuant to this agreement we engage sony to supply playstation 2 dvds for our products many of our playstation 2 products released during fiscal 2004 include the capability of online play customers who have an online adaptor which is manufactured and sold by sony for their playstation 2 consoles are able to play these products online in fiscal 2004 approximately 44 percent of our net revenue was derived from sales of ea studio software for the playstation 2 compared to 37 percent in fiscal 2003 we released 24 titles worldwide in fiscal 2004 for the playstation 2 compared to 19 titles in fiscal 2003 our top five playstation 2 releases for the year were need for speed underground madden nfl 2004 medal of honor rising sun the lord of the rings the return of the king and fifa soccer 2004 as expected playstation product sales decreased in fiscal 2004 primarily due to the transition to current generation console systems although our playstation products can be played on the playstation 2 console we expect sales of current playstation products to continue to decline in fiscal 2005 microsoft under the terms of a licensing agreement we entered into with microsoft in december 2000 as amended we are authorized to develop and distribute dvdbased software products compatible with the xbox in may 2004 we announced that we would make many of our games capable of being played online via microsoft’s xbox live service customers will be able to play these products online once they have paid the xbox live subscription fee in fiscal 2004 approximately 13 percent of our net revenue was derived from sales of ea studio software for the xbox compared to nine percent in fiscal 2003 we released 21 titles worldwide in fiscal 2004 for the 7 xbox compared to 16 titles in fiscal 2003 our top five xbox releases for the year were need for speed underground madden nfl 2004  medal of honor rising sun the lord of the rings the return of the king and fifa soccer 2004 

nintendo under the terms of a licensing agreement we entered into with nintendo of america effective as of november 2001 we are authorized to develop and distribute proprietary optical format disk products compatible with the nintendo gamecube pursuant to this agreement we engage nintendo to supply nintendo gamecube proprietary optical format disk products for our products in fiscal 2004 approximately seven percent of our net revenue was derived from sales of ea studio software for the nintendo gamecube compared to seven percent in fiscal 2003 we released 19 titles worldwide in fiscal 2004 for the nintendo gamecube compared to 17 titles in fiscal 2003 our top five nintendo gamecube releases for the year were need for speed underground the lord of the rings the return of the king medal of honor rising sun madden nfl 2004 and james bond 007 everything or nothing  products and product development in fiscal 2004 we generated approximately 69 percent of our net revenue from ea studioproduced products released during the year during fiscal 2004 we introduced 32 ea studios titles representing 97 stock keeping units or skus compared to 31 ea studios titles comprising 86 skus in fiscal 2003 in fiscal 2004 we had 27 titles that sold over one million units aggregated across all platforms in fiscal 2003 we had 22 titles and in fiscal 2002 we had 16 titles that sold over one million units aggregated across all platforms a sku is a version of a title designed for play on a particular platform and intended for distribution in a particular territory for fiscal 2004 no title represented more than 10 percent of our total fiscal 2004 net revenue for fiscal 2003 we had one title harry potter and the chamber of secrets tm  published on seven different platforms which represented approximately 10 percent of our total fiscal 2003 net revenue for fiscal 2002 harry potter and the sorcerer’s stone tm  published on four different platforms represented approximately 12 percent of our total fiscal 2002 net revenue the products produced by ea studios are designed and created by our employee designers and artists and by nonemployee software developers “independent artists” or “thirdparty developers” we typically advance development funds to the independent artists and thirdparty developers during development of our games which payments are considered advances against subsequent royalties based on the sales of the products these terms are typically set forth in written agreements entered into with the independent artists and thirdparty developers we publish products in a number of categories such as sports action strategy simulations role playing and adventure each of which is becoming increasingly competitive our sportsrelated products marketed under the ea sports brand name accounted for a significant percentage of net revenue in fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 the sports category is highly competitive and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our historical success in this category or that our licenses will be renewed the retail selling prices of our newly released products in north america excluding rereleases of older titles marketed as “classics” typically range from 3000 to 5000 “classics” titles have retail selling prices that range from 1000 to 2000 the retail selling prices of our titles outside of north america vary widely depending on factors such as local market conditions our goal is to maintain our position as a leading publisher of games sold for play on the current generation of 128bit video game consoles and to extend our success into the next generation of consoles and technology we will continue to invest in tools and technologies designed to facilitate development of our products for current generation platforms while also investing in tools and technologies for the next generation of consoles and technology these investments are recorded in research and development in our consolidated statement of operations we had research and development expenditures of 511 million in fiscal 2004 401 million in fiscal 2003 and 381 million in fiscal 2002 8 eacom web site free content we offer free games on our website under the following four brands pogo ea games ea sports and ea sports big the majority of these free games are original games designed solely for play on the web while some of the product offerings capitalize on our existing franchises adapted for online play as of march 31 2004 our online product offerings within each brand included the following

our eacom website offerings and persistent state world games focus on targeting and serving consumers by  marketing and distribution we market the products produced by ea studios under the ea games ea sports and ea sports big brands products marketed under the ea sports brand typically simulate professional and collegiate sports and include franchises such as madden nfl fifa soccer and nba live products marketed under the ea sports big brand typically feature extreme sports or modified traditional sports and include such titles as ssx 3 def jam vendetta and nfl street formerly known as electronic arts distribution our ea partners global business unit operates under a variety of deal types and structures with the intent of generating leveraging andor owning intellectual properties conceived by third party developers publishers or licensors worldwide through ea partners we provide direct development expertise to our partners via an internal production staff while also making available our publishing resources to provide sales marketing and distribution services on a global basis ea partners currently has relationships with dice lionhead krome studios black hole games free radical design gas powered games castaway entertainment and eurocom developments among others ea partners’ largest copublishing arrangement is with dice headquartered in stockholm sweden in which we hold an equity interest dice is the creator of the hit battlefield series of online multiplayer games which include worldwide bestsellers battlefield 1942 and battlefield vietnam on the pc ea partners also distributes finished goods on behalf of other thirdparty publishers these titles are developed and manufactured by other publishers and delivered to us as completed products for which we provide distribution services our distribution partners have included square enix capcom namco koei and novalogic the interactive software game business has become increasingly “hit” driven requiring significantly greater expenditures for marketing and advertising of our products particularly for television advertising there can be no assurance that we will continue to produce “hit” titles or that advertising for any product will increase sales sufficiently to recoup those advertising expenses we generated approximately 95 percent of our north american net revenue from direct sales to retailers through a field sales organization of professionals and a group of telephone sales representatives the remaining 5 percent of our north american sales were made through a limited number of specialized and regional distributors and rack jobbers in markets where we believe direct sales would not be economical we had direct sales to one customer walmart stores inc which represented 13 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2004 12 percent in fiscal 2003 and 14 percent in fiscal 2002 outside of north america we derive revenues primarily from direct sales to retailers our largest indirect sales relationship is with pinnacle in europe sales of our products through pinnacle make up approximately 12 percent of our total net revenue we use pinnacle to provide logistical and collection services to our retail customers under the terms of our agreement with pinnacle our products are held by pinnacle on consignment until shipment to the retailer in addition we authorize returns from or price protection to retailers and we are obliged to give pinnacle the corresponding credit in a few of our smaller markets we sell 10 our products through distributors with whom we have written agreements or informal arrangements depending on the business customs of the territories 

in north america we have stockbalancing programs for our pc products which allow for the exchange of pc products by resellers under certain circumstances in all of our major geographical markets we accept product returns on our pc products and we may decide to accept product returns or provide price protection under certain circumstances for our console products after we analyze inventory remaining in the channel the rate of inventory sellthrough in the channel and our remaining inventory on hand it is our policy to exchange products or give credits rather than give cash refunds we actively monitor and manage the volume of our sales to retailers and distributors and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel can result in high returns or the requirement for substantial price protection in subsequent periods the distribution channels through which our games are sold have been characterized by change including consolidations and financial difficulties of certain distributors and retailers the bankruptcy or other business difficulties of a distributor or retailer could render our accounts receivable from such entity uncollectible which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition in addition an increasing number of companies are competing for access to our distribution channels our arrangements with our distributors and retailers may be terminated by either party at any time without cause distributors and retailers often carry products that compete with ours retailers of our products typically have a limited amount of shelf space and promotional resources that they are willing to devote to the software games category and there is intense competition for these resources there can be no assurance that distributors and retailers will continue to purchase our products or provide our products with adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support inventory and working capital our management focuses considerable attention to managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers prior to the release of our products and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct and territorybyterritory basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that match this forecasted demand we do not maintain substantial inventories of our products because 1 historically a substantial portion of a particular product sales occur within the first 6090 days after the product’s release and 2 the lead times on reorders of our products are generally short approximately two to three weeks further as discussed in “marketing and distribution” and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we have practices in place with our customers such as stock balancing and price protection that reduce product returns international operations we conduct business and have whollyowned subsidiaries throughout the world including offices in australia austria brazil canada china the czech republic denmark england finland france germany greece hungary italy japan the netherlands new zealand norway poland portugal singapore south africa south korea spain sweden switzerland taiwan and thailand international net revenue increased by 29 percent to 1348 million or 45 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2004 compared to 1047 million or 42 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2003 although we expect international revenue to grow in fiscal 2005 we do not believe it will continue to grow at the same rate as fiscal 2004 the amounts of net revenue and identifiable assets attributable to each of our geographic regions for each of the last three fiscal years are set forth in note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 hereof 11 manufacturing and suppliers the suppliers we use to manufacture our games can be characterized in three types  in many instances we are able to acquire materials on a volumediscount basis we have multiple potential sources of supply for most materials except for the disk component of our playstation playstation 2 and nintendo gamecube disk products as discussed in “relationships with significant hardware platform companies” we also have alternate sources for the manufacture and assembly of most of our products to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in production of our software and related documentation and packaging however a shortage of components manufacturing delays by sony or nintendo or other factors beyond our control could impair our ability to manufacture or have manufactured our products backlog we typically ship orders immediately upon receipt to the extent that any backlog may or may not exist at the end of a reporting period it would be both coincidental and an unreliable indicator of future results of any period seasonality our business is highly seasonal we typically experience our highest revenue and profits in the holiday season quarter ending in december and a seasonal low in revenue and profits in the quarter ending in june however our results can vary based on title release dates and shipment schedules employees as of march 31 2004 we employed approximately 4800 people of whom over 2300 were outside the united states we believe that our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is a critical factor in the successful development of our products and that our future success will depend in large measure on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees to date we have been successful in recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified personnel to conduct our business successfully we believe that our relationships with our employees are strong none of our employees are represented by a union guild or other collective bargaining organization 12 executive officers the following table sets forth information regarding our executive officers who are appointed by and serve at the discretion of the board of directors  mr

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview the following overview is a toplevel discussion of our operating results as well as the trends and drivers of our business management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers is important in order to understand our results for fiscal 2004 as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form 10k including in “business” the remainder of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “risk factors” or the consolidated financial statements and related notes about electronic arts we develop market publish and distribute interactive software games that are playable by consumers on home videogame machines such as the sony playstation 2® microsoft xbox® and nintendo gamecube tm consoles personal computers handheld game machines such as the game boy® advance and online over the internet and other proprietary online networks many of our games are based on content that we license from others eg madden nfl football harry potter tm and fifa soccer and many of our games are based on our own whollyowned intellectual property eg the sims tm  medal of honor tm  our goal is to develop titles which appeal to the mass markets and as a result we develop market publish and distribute our games in over 100 countries often translating and localizing them for sale in nonenglish speaking countries our goal is to create software game “franchises” that allow us to publish new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the same property examples of this are the annual iterations of our sportsbased franchises eg ncaa football and fifa soccer titles based on longlived movie properties eg james bond tm and harry potter and whollyowned properties that can be successfully sequeled eg the sims and medal of honor overview of fiscal 2004 financial results net revenue for fiscal 2004 was 29571 million up 191 percent as compared with 24822 million for fiscal 2003 we had 27 platinum titles over one million units sold in fiscal 2004 as compared to 22 platinum titles in 2003 in fiscal 2004 six franchises sold more than five million units the sims need for speed tm  medal of honor fifa soccer the lord of the rings tm and madden nfl football  net income for fiscal 2004 was 5773 million an 821 percent increase over fiscal 2003 diluted earnings per share increased 731 percent to 187 as compared with 108 for fiscal 2003 the growth in earnings was primarily driven by higher sales volume and increased gross margin operating cash flow was 6693 million as compared with 7145 million for fiscal 2003 the decline was primarily a result of the timing of sales during the fourth quarter management’s overview of historical and prospective business trends sales of “hit” titles during fiscal 2004 sales of a number of “hit” titles contributed to our revenue growth several of which were top sellers across a number of international markets our topfiveselling titles across all platforms worldwide in fiscal 2004 were need for speed   tm underground madden nfl 2004 the lord of the rings tm  the return of the king tm  medal of honor tm rising sun and fifa soccer 2004  hit titles are important to our financial performance because they benefit from overall economies of scale we have developed and it is our objective to continue to develop many of our hit titles to become franchise titles that can be regularly iterated increased console installed base as consumers purchase the current generation of consoles either as first time buyers or by upgrading from a previous generation the console installed base increases as the installed base for a particular console increases we are generally able to increase our unit volume however as consumers anticipate the next generation of consoles unit volumes often decrease in the us and europe 21 we believe the installed base for the current generation of consoles — playstation2 xbox and nintendo gamecube — increased over 30 percent 60 percent and 80 percent respectively during fiscal 2004 accordingly we believe the significant increase in the installed base for these consoles was a contributing factor to our net revenue growth in fiscal 2004 in march 2004 microsoft reduced the retail price of its xbox consoles in the us and in may 2004 sony did the same with its playstation2 consoles as price reductions drive sales of consoles and the related installed base of these current generation consoles increases during fiscal 2005 we expect unit sales of current generation titles to remain strong 

software prices as current generation console prices decrease we expect more valueoriented consumers to become part of the interactive entertainment software market we experienced this trend several years ago when prices were reduced on previous generation consoles eg sony playstation and nintendo 64 we believe that hit titles will continue to be launched at premium price points and will maintain those premium price points longer than less popular games however as a result of a more valueoriented consumer base and a greater number of software titles being published we expect average software prices to gradually come down which we expect to negatively impact our gross margin international sales growth our fiscal 2004 net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately 45 percent of our worldwide net revenue up from 42 percent in fiscal 2003 our fiscal 2004 increase in international net revenue was driven primarily by increased sales in europe in fiscal 2005 we anticipate that international net revenue will continue to increase as a percentage of our worldwide net revenue although not at the same rate as in fiscal 2004 as we strengthen our presence in new territories and as the console installed base expands more rapidly outside of north america foreign exchange impact given that a significant portion of our business is conducted internationally in foreign currency fluctuations in currency prices can have a material impact on our results of operations for example the average exchange rate for one euro as compared to the us dollar increased from 099 in fiscal 2003 to 117 in fiscal 2004 we estimate that we had a total foreign exchange benefit on net revenue of approximately 156 million during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 although we intend to continue to utilize foreign exchange forward and option contracts to either mitigate or hedge against some foreign currency exposures we cannot predict the effect foreign currency fluctuations will have on us in fiscal 2005 increasing cost of titles hit titles have become increasingly more expensive to produce and market as the platforms on which they are played continue to advance technologically and consumers demand continual improvements in the overall gameplay experience we expect this trend to continue as we require larger production teams to create our titles the technology needed to develop titles becomes more complex we continue to develop and expand the online gaming capabilities included in our products and we develop new methods to distribute our content via the internet any increase in the cost of licensing thirdparty intellectual property used in our products would also make these products more expensive to publish expansion of studio resources and technology during fiscal 2004 as part of our effort to more efficiently utilize our resources and technology we expanded our studio facilities in los angeles and vancouver allowing us to consolidate several smaller studios and resources in fiscal 2005 we expect to devote significant resources primarily to the expansion of our studios in north america and europe as we move through the life cycle of current generation consoles we will devote increased resources to developing current generation titles and increase spending associated with tools and technologies for the next generation of consoles we expect to develop more titles internally as a result of our studio expansions we expect these activities to increase our research and development expenses and decrease our thirdparty development costs both as a percentage of net revenue in addition we expect the decrease in thirdparty development costs to positively impact our gross margin critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities contingent assets and 22 liabilities and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown as a result actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

sales returns and allowances and bad debt reserves we principally derive revenue from sales of packaged interactive software games designed for play on videogame platforms such as the playstation 2 xbox and nintendo gamecube pcs and handheld game machines such as the nintendo game boy advance product revenue is recognized net of sales allowances we also have stockbalancing programs for our pc products which allow for the exchange of pc products by resellers under certain circumstances we may decide to provide price protection for both our personal computer and videogame system products in making this determination we evaluate inventory remaining in the channel the rate of inventory sellthrough in the channel and our remaining inventory on hand it is our general practice to exchange products or give credits rather than give cash refunds we estimate potential future product returns price protection and stockbalancing programs related to currentperiod product revenue we analyze historical returns current sellthrough of distributor and retailer inventory of our products current trends in the videogame market and the overall economy changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and price protection allowances in addition management monitors and manages the volume of our sales to retailers and distributors and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel can result in high returns or substantial price protection requirements in subsequent periods in the past actual returns have not generally exceeded our reserves however actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms product updates or competing products for example the risk of product returns for our products may increase as the playstation 2 xbox and nintendo gamecube consoles pass the midpoint of their lifecycle and an increasing number and aggregate amount of competitive products heighten pricing and competitive pressures while management believes it can make reliable estimates regarding these matters these estimates are inherently subjective accordingly if our estimates changed our returns reserves would change which would impact the net revenue we report for example if actual returns were significantly greater than the reserves we have established our actual results would decrease our reported net revenue conversely if actual returns were significantly less than our reserves this would increase our reported net revenue similarly significant judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly we cannot predict customer bankruptcies or an inability of any of our customers to meet their financial obligations to us therefore our estimates could differ materially from actual results royalties  licenses our royalty expenses consist of payments to 1 copublishing andor distribution affiliates 2 content licensors and 3 independent software developers copublishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for delivery of product license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities professional sports organizations movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademark copyright personal publicity rights content andor other intellectual property royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games 23 royaltybased payments made to content licensors and distribution affiliates that are paid in advance are generally capitalized as prepaid royalties and expensed to cost of goods sold at the greater of the contractual or effective royalty rate based on net product sales with regard to payments made to independent software developers and copublishing affiliates we are generally subject to development risk prior to the general release of the product accordingly payments that are due prior to completion of the product are generally expensed as research and development as the services are incurred payments due after completion of the product primarily royaltybased in nature are generally expensed as cost of goods sold at the higher of the contractual or effective royalty rate based on net product sales each quarter we also evaluate the future realization of any prepaid royalties as well as minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales any impairments determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense impairments determined postlaunch are charged to cost of goods sold in either case we rely on estimated revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties if actual revenue or revised sales estimates fall below the initial sales estimate then the actual charge taken may be greater in any given quarter than anticipated as of march 31 2004 we had 227 million of prepaid royalty assets and approximately 1303 million in future obligations to our copublishing andor distribution affiliates and content licensors that could be impaired if our sales estimates changed valuation of longlived assets we evaluate both purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets in order to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in value exists this evaluation requires us to estimate among other things the remaining useful lives of the assets and future cash flows of the business these evaluations and estimates require the use of judgment our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates under current accounting standards we make judgments about the remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet in order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred management makes various assumptions about the future value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash flows our future net cash flows are primarily dependent on the sale of products for play on proprietary videogame consoles handheld game machines and pcs “platforms” the success of our products is affected by our ability to accurately predict which platforms and which products we develop will be successful also our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules due to product sales shortfalls we may not realize the future net cash flows necessary to recover our longlived assets which may result in an impairment charge being recorded in the future we recorded 05 million of impairment charges on longlived assets during fiscal 2004 663 million during fiscal 2003 and 128 million in fiscal 2002 income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction where we operate these estimates involve complex issues require extended periods of time to resolve and require us to make judgments such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns we are also required to make the determinations of the need to record deferred tax liabilities and the recoverability of deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is established to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction in addition changes in our business including the geographic mix of income as well as changes in valuation allowances the applicable accounting rules the applicable tax laws and regulations and interpretations 24 thereof developments in tax audit matters and estimated level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate for example in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we resolved certain taxrelated matters with the internal revenue service which lowered our income tax expense by 197 million and resulted in a 25 percent rate reduction

playstation in fiscal 2004 net revenue from playstation products decreased by 703 million to 296 million as compared to fiscal 2003 we anticipated the decline in net revenue from playstation products as we continued to transition away from that platform although our playstation products are playable on the playstation 2 console we expect sales of current playstation products to continue to decline in the future copublishing and distribution in fiscal 2004 net revenue from copublishing and distribution products increased by 225 million to 3982 million as compared to fiscal 2003 the increase was due to a 745 million increase in europe primarily from increased sales in the final fantasy freedom fighters and battlefield franchises partially offset by a decline in the kingdom hearts franchise in north america although copublishing and distribution net revenue increased it declined as a percentage of net revenue advertising programming licensing and other in fiscal 2004 net revenue from advertising programming licensing and other products decreased by 426 million to 338 million as compared to fiscal 2003 the decrease was a result of expected declines in our advertising and programming net revenue following our renegotiation of the terms of our relationship with aol during the three months ended june 30 2003 and an expected decline in our game boy color net revenue as we transitioned away from that platform operations by segment in march 2003 we consolidated the operations of the eacom business segment into our core business we now consider online capability and gameplay to be integral to our existing and future products accordingly beginning april 1 2003 we no longer manage our online products and services as a separate business segment and we have

development expenses in fiscal 2004 as we continued to support the global growth of our research and development capabilities in recent quarters we have developed a greater number of titles internally

additionally during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we approved a plan to consolidate the los angeles california irvine california and las vegas nevada studios into one major game studio in los angeles these measures were taken in order to maximize efficiencies and streamline the creative development process and operations of our studios in connection with these consolidation activities we recorded a total pretax restructuring charge of 51 million including 16 million for the shutdown of facilities related to noncancelable lease payments for permanently vacated properties and associated costs 20 million for the writeoff of abandoned equipment and leasehold improvements at facilities that were permanently vacated and 15 million for employee severance expenses related to involuntary terminations fiscal 2003 online restructuring in march 2003 we consolidated the operations of eacom into our core business and eliminated separate reporting for its class b common stock for all future reporting periods after fiscal 2003 we consider online functionality to be an integral component of our existing and future products 

during fiscal 2003 we recorded restructuring charges including asset impairment of 670 million consisting of 18 million for workforce reductions 23 million for consolidation of facilities and other administrative charges and 629 million for the writeoff of noncurrent assets the estimated costs for workforce reduction included severance charges for terminated employees costs for certain outplacement service contracts and costs associated with the tender offer to retire employee class b options the workforce reduction resulted in the termination of approximately 50 positions the consolidation of facilities resulted in the closure of eacom’s chicago and virginia facilities and an adjustment for the closure of eacom’s san diego studio in fiscal 2002 the estimated costs for consolidation of facilities and other administrative charges included contractual rental commitments under real estate leases for unutilized office space reduced by estimated future sublease income and costs to close the facilities as part of the restructuring efforts we performed impairment tests under sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets”  to evaluate the recoverability of our longlived assets and remaining finitelived identifiable intangible assets utilized in the eacom business this test was performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 in conjunction with the overall valuation of the eacom legal entity and its class b common stock in february 2003 our only outside holder of class b common stock aol exercised its right to exchange its class b shares for shares of class a common stock in late december 2002 eacom launched the sims online an online game based on our “the sims” line of pc games which have sold over 20 million units worldwide the sims online was expected to be eacom’s flagship online subscription offering as of march 31 2003 the number of units sold and the number of subscribers for this product along with other eacom revenue were significantly below our expectations we considered these developments to be a triggering event under sfas no 144 which caused us to cancel most of our plans to develop similar online products that would have utilized longlived assets associated with the eacom business impairment charges on longlived assets amounted to 629 million and included 249 million relating to impaired customized internaluse software systems for the eacom infrastructure 256 million for other longlived assets and 124 million of finitelived intangibles impairment charges relating to eacom’s acquisitions of kesmai corporation and pogo corporation now referred to as “kesmai” and “pogo” respectively studios as of march 31 2003 there were no finitelived intangible balances remaining related to kesmai and pogo studios in conjunction with our annual policy to reassess the remaining useful lives of goodwill and certain indefinitelived intangibles and test the recoverability of these longlived assets in accordance with sfas no 142 our fair value based tests did not indicate an impairment of our recorded goodwill and certain indefinitelived intangibles at the eacom reporting unit level as of january 1 2003 the remaining portion of kesmai goodwill assets as of march 31 2003 was 138 million the remaining portion of pogo goodwill assets as of march 31 2003 was 159 million there are no assurances that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings and a corresponding write down of goodwill and certain indefinitelived intangibles 32 the following table reflects our unaudited pro forma consolidated basic earnings per share for the fiscal years ended 2003 and 2002 as if the consolidation of the operations of our eacom business segment into our core

with emerging issues task force “eitf” no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring”

our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 hereof interest and other income net interest and other income net for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 in thousands  interest and other income net in fiscal 2004 increased from fiscal 2003 primarily due to  income taxes income taxes for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 in thousands  33 our effective income tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from significant operations outside the us which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate of 35 percent the effective income tax rate was 275 percent for fiscal 2004 and 310 percent for fiscal 2003 the reduced effective income tax rate in fiscal 2004 primarily reflects the resolution of certain taxrelated matters with the internal revenue service in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 which lowered our income tax expense by 197 million and resulted in a 25 percent rate reduction and a change in the geographic mix of taxable income subject to lower tax rates we intend to indefinitely reinvest our international earnings outside the us and accordingly have not provided us taxes that would be incurred if such earnings were repatriated back to the us undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately 7383 million at march 31 2004 we are currently projecting an effective income tax rate of approximately 29 percent for fiscal 2005 an effective income tax rate projection which is inherently uncertain is based on current tax law and current projections of the mix of income in various taxing jurisdictions and assumes no material changes in our business or the applicable tax or accounting rules our actual effective income tax rates for fiscal 2005 and future periods can differ from the projected effective income tax rates due to a variety of factors including changes in our business that were not taken into account in connection with our projection a variation between the projected and actual mix of income between international and domestic operations changes or interpretations to applicable tax laws and regulations changes in the applicable accounting rules or our ability to realize deferred tax assets or developments in tax audit matters with various tax authorities for example in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we resolved certain taxrelated matters with the internal revenue service which lowered our income tax expense by 197 million and resulted in a 25 percent rate reduction finally our projected effective income tax rate for fiscal 2005 does not take into account a new election that is available under the us income tax rules regarding the allocation between us and foreign jurisdictions tax deductions attributable to employee stock option compensation if we take advantage of this election it could detrimentally affect our effective income tax rate we have not yet determined the impact that the election would have on our reported results net income net income for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 in thousands  reported net income increased in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to the reasons discussed above although the dollar amount of our expenses increased in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 net income as a percentage of net revenue increased to 195 percent as compared to 128 percent in fiscal 2003 because expenses including our cost of goods sold grew at a slower rate than did our net revenue 34 comparison of fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2002 net revenue from a geographical perspective our net revenue for the fiscal years ended march 31 2003 and 2002 was as follows in thousands  north america for fiscal 2003 net revenue in north america increased by 313 percent as compared to fiscal 2002 from a franchise perspective the net revenue increase was primarily driven by sales of products released during the year ended march 31 2003 in the following nine franchises medal of honor lord of the rings kingdom hearts the sims need for speed harry potter ncaa football bond and tiger woods pga tour increased sales in these franchises resulted in increased net revenue of 4511 million for the year ended march 31 2003 as compared to the year ended march 31 2002 the increase was offset by decreases in net revenue in our final fantasy ssx and nba street franchises as none of these franchises had products released during fiscal 2003 together decreased

excluding japan increased by 641 percent compared to the year ended march 31 2002 our net revenue from sales of products on the playstation 2 and xbox platforms increased by 157 and 63 million respectively for the year ended march 31 2003 primarily due to the higher installed base on both platforms and the fact that 20 xbox titles were available in the asia pacific region in 2003 as compared to three in 2002 sales of copublishing and distribution titles increased 111 million primarily due to sales of final fantasy x and battlefield 1942 in fiscal 2003 japan for fiscal 2003 net revenue from sales in japan increased by 366 percent compared to fiscal 2002 the increase was due primarily to the higher playstation 2 installed base and strong sales of playstation 2 titles most notably medal of honor frontline tm  2002 fifa world cup and project fifa world cup which generated an additional 157 million in net revenue in fiscal 2003 we also had an increase in revenues from copublishing and distribution products of 110 million due in large part to sales of final fantasy 11 these increases were offset by a decrease in playstation revenue of 57 million 35 our worldwide net revenue by product line for fiscal 2003 and 2002 was as follows in thousands  playstation 2 net revenue from sales of playstation 2 products increased from 4829 million in fiscal 2002 to 9107 million in fiscal 2003 as a percentage of total net revenue sales of playstation 2 products increased by 87 percent in fiscal 2003 the increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth in the installed base and greater demand for our products for example in the us the installed base for the playstation 2 increased approximately 115 percent as compared to fiscal 2002 due in part to sony’s hardware price cut in north america in may 2002 pc net revenue from sales of titles for the pc increased in fiscal 2003 by 95 percent to 4996 million as compared to 4563 million in fiscal 2002 the increase was primarily due to strong sales of the sims franchise titles and the release of simcity 4   tm  for a combined increase of 710 million partially offset by lower net revenue from fiscal 2002 releases black and white   tm and dune emperor totaling 322 million although pc net revenue increased in fiscal 2003 pc net revenue declined as a percentage of net revenue as consumers migrated to console gameplay xbox net revenue from sales of xbox products increased from 784 million to 2194 million or 43 percent of net revenue in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 the increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth in the installed base and greater demand for our products  the installed base increased in fiscal 2003 due to the launch of xbox in the united states in november 2001 and in europe in march 2002 in fiscal 2002 there was only a short period five months in the united states and one month in europe during which the consoles were available as compared to twelve months in fiscal 2003 as a result we were able to release xbox products during all of fiscal 2003 nintendo gamecube net revenue from nintendo gamecube products increased from 517 million to 1767 million or 41 percent of net revenue in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 the increase in net revenue for fiscal 2003 was primarily due to growth in the installed base of the nintendo gamecube which was available in every 36 major market in which we operated during fiscal 2003 the nintendo gamecube was launched in japan in september 2001 and north america in november 2001 but not in europe until may 2002 

game boy advance net revenue from sales of game boy advance titles increased in fiscal 2003 by 812 percent to 791 million as compared to 437 million in fiscal 2002 primarily due to increased net revenue in the lord of the rings and harry potter franchises and the increased number of game boy advance titles available in fiscal 2003 in fiscal 2003 we released seven titles on the game boy advance platform compared to three in fiscal 2002 playstation in fiscal 2003 net revenue from playstation products decreased by 896 million to 1000 million as compared to fiscal 2002 the decrease in net revenue was attributable to the market transition to newer generation console systems and our transition away from that platform copublishing and distribution net revenue from copublishing products and distribution products increased 397 percent to 3758 million in fiscal 2003 compared to 2690 million in fiscal 2002 primarily due to strong sales of hit titles including kingdom hearts 1503 ad the new world and higher battlefield 1942 franchise net revenue advertising programming licensing and other in fiscal 2003 net revenue from advertising programming licensing and other products decreased by 425 million to 764 million as compared to fiscal 2002 the decrease was primarily a result of an expected decline in our game boy color and nintendo 64 net revenue as we transitioned away from those platforms in addition revenue derived from advertising on our online games sites decreased 16 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to 38 million in lower advertising revenue generated from aol and cobranded aol online properties and a 18 million decrease in online advertising purchased by online game companies that link their games sites to ours cost of goods sold costs of goods sold for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 in thousands  in fiscal 2003 cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 40 percent to 432 percent in fiscal 2003 from 472 percent in fiscal 2002 primarily due to  37 marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 in thousands  marketing and sales expenses increased by 379 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 primarily due to  as a percentage of net revenue marketing and sales expenses declined from 140 percent of net revenue in fiscal 2002 to 134 percent of net revenue in fiscal 2003 marketing and sales includes vendor reimbursements for advertising expenses of 282 million in fiscal 2003 and 89 million in fiscal 2002 general and administrative general and administrative expenses for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 in thousands  general and administrative expenses increased by 222 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 primarily due to an increase in payroll costs of 269 million to support the increased growth of these functions worldwide as a percentage of net revenue general and administrative expenses declined from 62 percent of net revenue in fiscal 2002 to 53 percent of net revenue research and development research and development expenses for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 in thousands  research and development expenses increased by 54 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 primarily due to additional headcountrelated expenses offset by lower advance writeoffs and development spending on discontinued products in fiscal 2003 as a percentage of revenue research and development expenses declined from 220 percent of net revenue in fiscal 2002 to 161 percent of net revenue in fiscal 2003 research and development includes vendor reimbursements for development expenses of 150 million in fiscal 2003 and 170 million in fiscal 2002 amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 in thousands  38 the decrease in amortization in fiscal 2003 of 179 million was primarily due to  in addition we recorded intangible impairment charges relating to our restructuring of the eacom business segment of 124 million in fiscal 2003 and 16 million in fiscal 2002 for further information please see our discussion under “restructuring and asset impairment charges” below restructuring and asset impairment charges restructuring and asset impairment charges for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 in thousands  for a discussion of our fiscal 2003 restructurings please refer to “comparison of fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2003” above fiscal 2002 restructuring in october 2001 we announced a restructuring plan for eacom the restructuring initiatives involved strategic decisions to discontinue certain product offerings and focus only on key online priorities that aligned with our fiscal 2003 operational objectives a concurrent workforce reduction resulted in the termination of approximately 270 positions

slower rate than did our net revenue impact of recently issued accounting standards in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued interpretation no 46 “fin 46” “consolidation of variable interest entities”  this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51 “consolidated financial statements ” addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities “vies” that either i do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or ii are owned by equity investors who lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest this interpretation applies immediately to vies created after january 31 2003 with regard to vies already in existence prior to february 1 2003 the implementation of fin 46 was delayed and currently applies to the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after december 15 2003 fin 46 requires disclosure of vies in financial statements issued after january 31 2003 if it is reasonably possible that as of the transition date i we will be the primary beneficiary of an existing vie that will require consolidation or ii we will hold a significant variable interest in or have significant involvement with an existing vie we adopted fin 46 in the quarter ended december 31 2003 however it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations in january 2003 the emerging issues task force reached consensus on issue no 0021 “eitf 0021” “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables”  eitf 0021 provides guidance on how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables requires that such deliverables be accounted for separately eitf 0021 allows for prospective adoption for arrangements entered into after june 15 2003 or adoption via a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle we adopted eitf 0021 in the quarter ended june 30 2003 however it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations in march 2004 the emerging issues task force ratified the consensus reached on paragraphs 6 through 23 of issue no 0301 “eitf 031” “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments”  eitf 031 requires that certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures should be required for debt and marketable equity securities classified as availableforsale or heldtomaturity under sfas no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” and sfas no 124 40 “accounting for certain investments held by notforprofit organizations” that are impaired at the balance sheet date but for which an otherthantemporary impairment

in march 2004 the fasb issued an exposure draft on the proposed statement of financial accounting standards “sharebased payment — an amendment of fasb statements no 123 and 95”  the proposed statement addresses the accounting for sharebased payment transactions with employees and other thirdparties the proposed standard would eliminate the ability to account for sharebased compensation transactions using accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees”  and generally would require that such transactions be accounted for using a fairvaluebased method if the final standard is approved as currently drafted in the exposure draft it would have a material impact on the amount of earnings we report management has not yet determined the impact that the proposed statement will have on our business liquidity and capital resources   changes in cash flow during the year ended march 31 2004 we generated 6693 million of cash from operating activities compared to 7145 million for the year ended march 31 2003 this decline was primarily the result of our fourth quarter sales in fiscal 2004 occurring later in the quarter as compared to fiscal 2003 particularly in europe we expect to continue to generate similar levels of operating cash flow in fiscal 2005 for the year ended march 31 2004 our primary use of cash in nonoperating activities consisted of 896 million in capital expenditures primarily related to the expansions of our los angeles and vancouver studios these nonoperating expenditures were offset by net proceeds of 3718 million in shortterm investments and 2278 million in proceeds from the sale of our common stock through stock plans during the year ended march 31 2004 

receivables net our gross accounts receivable balance was 3666 million and 2467 million as of march 31 2004 and march 31 2003 respectively the increase in our accounts receivable balance was primarily due to our fourth quarter sales in fiscal 2004 occurring later in the quarter as compared to fiscal 2003 particularly in europe we expect to collect a substantial portion of these amounts in the three months ended june 30 2004 reserves for sales returns pricing allowances and doubtful accounts decreased from 1646 million as of march 31 2003 to 1547 million as of march 31 2004 both the sales return and price protection reserves decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of trailing six and nine month net revenue as of march 31

inventories inventories increased to 551 million as of march 31 2004 from 397 million as of march 31 2003 primarily due to overall growth in europe we typically have a higher inventory balance as a percentage of net revenue on hand in europe compared to north america due to the need to provide multiple language versions of each title in that region no single title represented more than 40 million of inventory as of march 31 2004 

other current assets other current assets increased to 1439 million as of march 31 2004 from 835 million as of march 31 2003 primarily due to increases in volume rebates and advertising credits owed to us by our suppliers and vat receivable both relating to the growth of our business offset by lower prepaid royalties as we continue to increase internal title development 

accounts payable accounts payable increased to 1141 million as of march 31 2004 from 1063 million as of march 31 2003 primarily due to the higher sales volume we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 

accrued and other liabilities our accrued and other liabilities increased to 6082 million as of march 31 2004 from 4645 million as of march 31 2003 as a result of the overall increase in our sales and related operational expenses and profit the increase was due to increases in income taxes payable accrued compensation and benefits accrued development deferred revenue and vat payable we anticipate our accrued and other liabilities balance to decline following our tax and bonus payments during the three months ended june 30 2004

in april 2002 we agreed to pay certain taxes incurred by bruce mcmillan executive vice president group studio general manager worldwide studios arising from his temporary employment with us in the united kingdom mr mcmillan agreed to reimburse us for those payments upon receipt of his corresponding tax refund from the canadian taxing authorities we subsequently paid approximately 168704 and 32931 in october 2002 and april 2003 respectively to the uk inland revenue for taxes incurred by mr mcmillan in may 2003 mr mcmillan became an executive officer of electronic arts as of january 22 2004 mr mcmillan had repaid us the entire amount of the tax payments we made on his behalf offbalance sheet commitments lease commitments we lease certain of our current facilities and certain equipment under noncancelable operating lease agreements we are required to pay property taxes insurance and normal maintenance costs for certain of our facilities and will be required to pay any increases over the base year of these expenses on the remainder of our facilities 

in february 1995 we entered into a buildtosuit lease with a third party for our headquarters facility in redwood city california which was refinanced with keybank national association in july 2001 and expires in july 2006 we accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with sfas no 13 44 “accounting for leases”  as amended existing campus facilities developed in phase one comprise a total of 350000 square feet and provide space for sales marketing administration and research and development functions we have an option to purchase the property land and facilities for a maximum of 1450 million or at the end of the lease to arrange for i an extension of the lease or ii sale of the property to a third party while we retain an obligation to the owner for approximately 90 percent of the difference between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up to 1289 million if the sales price is less than this amount subject to certain provisions of the lease 

in december 2000 we entered into a second buildtosuit lease with keybank national association for a fiveyear term beginning december 2000 to expand our redwood city california headquarters facilities and develop adjacent property adding approximately 310000 square feet to our campus construction was completed in june 2002 we accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with sfas no 13 as amended the facilities provide space for marketing sales and research and development we have an option to purchase the property for a maximum of 1300 million or at the end of the lease to arrange for i an extension of the lease or ii sale of the property to a third party while we retain an obligation to the owner for approximately 90 percent of the difference between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up to 1188 million if the sales price is less than this amount subject to certain provisions of the lease we believe the estimated fair values of both properties under these operating leases are in excess of their respective guaranteed residual values as of march 31 2004 for the two lease agreements with keybank national association as described above the lease rates are based upon the commercial paper rate and require us to maintain certain financial covenants as shown below all of which we were in compliance with as of march 31 2004  in july 2003 we entered into a lease agreement with an independent third party “the landlord” for a studio facility in los angeles california which commenced in october 2003 and expires in september 2013 with two fiveyear options to extend the lease term additionally we have options to purchase the property after five and ten years based on the fair market value of the property at the date of sale a right of first offer to purchase the property upon terms offered by the landlord and a right to share in the profits from a sale of the property we have accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with sfas no 13 as amended existing campus facilities comprise a total of 243000 square feet and provide space for research and development functions our rental obligation under this agreement is 502 million over the initial tenyear term of the lease we are taking possession of the property over a period of 18 months as the facilities become available for use this commitment is offset by sublease income of 58 million for the sublet to an affiliate of the landlord of 18000 square feet of the los angeles facility which commenced in october 2003 and expires in september 2013 with options of early termination by the affiliate after five years and by ea after four and five years inflation we believe the impact of inflation on our results of operations has not been significant for each of the past three fiscal years 45 risk factors our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may harm our business and financial performance if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs our business and financial performance could be harmed our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our securities could decline the success of our business is highly dependent on being able to predict which new videogame platforms will be successful and on the market acceptance and timely release of those platforms we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play on videogame platforms manufactured by third parties such as sony’s playstation 2 therefore the success of our products is driven in large part by the success of new videogame hardware systems and our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be most successful in the marketplace we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of a new platform a new platform for which we are developing products may be delayed may not succeed or may have a shorter life cycle than anticipated if the platforms for which we are developing products are not released when anticipated or do not attain wide market acceptance our revenue growth will suffer we may be unable to fully recover the resources we have committed and our financial performance will be harmed our platform licensors set the royalty rates and other fees that we must pay to publish games for their platforms and therefore have significant influence on our costs if one or more of the platform licensors adopt a different fee structure for future game consoles or we are unable to obtain such licenses our profitability will be materially impacted in the next few years we expect our platform licensors to introduce new game machines into the market in order to publish products for a new game machine we must take a license from the platform licensor which gives the platform licensor the opportunity to set the fee structure that we must pay in order to publish games for that platform similarly the platform licensors have retained the flexibility to change their fee structures for online gameplay and features for their consoles the control that platform licensors have over the fee structures for their future platforms and online access makes it difficult for us to predict our costs and profitability in the medium to long term it is also possible that platform licensors will not renew our licenses because publishing products for videogame consoles is the largest portion of our business any increase in fee structures or failure to secure a license relationship would have a significant negative impact on our business model and profitability our business is both seasonal and cyclical if we fail to deliver our products at the right times our sales will suffer our business is highly seasonal with the highest levels of consumer demand and a significant percentage of our revenue occurring in the december quarter if we miss this key selling period due to product delays or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have developed products our sales will suffer disproportionately our industry is also cyclical videogame platforms have historically had a life cycle of four to six years as one group of platforms is reaching the end of its cycle and new platforms are emerging consumers often defer game software purchases until the new platforms are available causing sales to decline this decline may not be offset by increased sales of products for the new platform for example following the launch of sony’s playstation2 platform we experienced a significant decline in revenue from sales of products for sony’s older playstation game console which was not immediately offset by revenue generated from sales of products for the playstation2 platform 46 our business is intensely competitive and increasingly “hit” driven if we do not continue to deliver “hit” products our success will be limited competition in our industry is intense and new products are regularly introduced a relatively small number of “hit” titles accounts for a significant portion of total sales for example during calendar year 2003 approximately 19 percent of the sales of videogames in north america consisted of only 20 “hit” products if our competitors develop more successful products or if we do not continue to develop consistently highquality products our revenue and profitability will decline if we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to intellectual property we will publish fewer hit titles and our revenue profitability and cash flows will decline competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our ea sports products include rights licensed from the major sports leagues and players associations similarly many of our hit ea games franchises such as bond harry potter and lord of the rings are based on key film and literary licenses competition for these licenses is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses and obtain additional licenses with significant commercial value our revenues and profitability will decline significantly competition for these licenses may also drive up the advances guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor which could significantly increase our costs if patent claims continue to be asserted against us we may be unable to sustain our current business models or profits many patents have been issued that may apply to widely used game technologies additionally infringement claims under many recently issued patents are now being asserted against internet implementations of existing games several such claims have been asserted against us such claims can harm our business we incur substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims regardless of the merits of the claims in the event that there is a determination that we have infringed a thirdparty patent we could incur significant monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future other intellectual property claims may increase our product costs or require us to cease selling affected products many of our products include extremely realistic graphical images and we expect that as technology continues to advance images will become even more realistic some of the images and other content are based on realworld examples that may inadvertently infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement from time to time we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims existing or future infringement claims against us whether valid or not may be time consuming and expensive to defend such claims or litigations could require us to stop selling the affected products redesign those products to avoid infringement or obtain a license all of which would be costly and harm our business our business our products and our distribution are subject to increasing regulation in key territories of content consumer privacy and online delivery if we do not successfully respond to these regulations our business may suffer legislation is continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution for example privacy laws in the united states and europe impose various restrictions on our web sites those rules vary by territory although the internet recognizes no geographical boundaries other countries such as germany have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged goods and those transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current united states laws in the united states the federal and several state governments are considering content restrictions on products such as ours as well as restrictions on distribution of such products any one or more of these factors could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers and by requiring additional differentiation between 47 products for different territories to address varying regulations this additional product differentiation would be costly 

if we do not consistently meet our product development schedules we will experience fluctuations in our operating results our ability to meet product development schedules is affected by a number of factors including the creative processes involved the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams required by the increasing complexity of our products and the need to refine and tune our products prior to their release we have in the past experienced development delays for several of our products failure to meet anticipated production or “go live” schedules may cause a shortfall in our revenue and profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different from expectations delays that prevent release of our products during peak selling seasons or in conjunction with specific events such as the release of a related movie or the beginning of a sports season or major sporting event could adversely affect our financial performance technology changes rapidly in our business and if we fail to anticipate new technologies the quality timeliness and competitiveness of our products will suffer rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate sometimes years in advance which technologies our products must take advantage of in order to make them competitive in the market at the time they are released therefore we usually start our product development with a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve we may not be able to achieve these goals or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly than we can in either case our products may be technologically inferior to competitive products or less appealing to consumers or both if we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule of our products then we may delay products until these technology goals can be achieved which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses alternatively we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies either to preserve our product launch schedule or to keep up with our competition which would increase our development expenses if we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel we will be unable to effectively conduct our business the market for technical creative marketing and other personnel essential to the development and marketing of our products and management of our businesses is extremely competitive our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of executives and key creative talent if we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need or replace key employees following their departure our ability to develop and manage our businesses will be impaired our platform licensors are our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of andor access to our videogame products if they do not approve our products we will be unable to ship to our customers our agreements with hardware licensors such as sony for the playstation 2 microsoft for the xbox and nintendo for the nintendo gamecube typically give significant control to the licensor over the approval and manufacturing of our products which could in certain circumstances leave us unable to get our products approved manufactured and shipped to customers these hardware licensors are also our chief competitors in most events control of the approval and manufacturing process by the platform licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently while we believe that our relationships with our hardware licensors are currently good the potential for these licensors to delay or refuse to approve or manufacture our products exists such occurrences would harm our business and our financial performance 48 we compete directly with microsoft and sony for sales of products with online capabilities we also require compatibility code and the consent of each in order to include online capabilities in our products for their respective platforms as online capabilities for videogame platforms become more significant microsoft and sony could restrict our ability to provide online capabilities for our console platform products if microsoft or sony refused to approve our products with online capabilities or significantly impacted the financial terms on which these services are offered to our customers our business could be harmed our international net revenue is subject to currency fluctuations for the year ended march 31 2004 international net revenue comprised 45 percent of total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2003 international net revenue comprised 42 percent of total consolidated net revenue we expect foreign sales to continue to account for a significant and growing portion of our revenue such sales are subject to unexpected regulatory requirements tariffs and other barriers additionally foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies which may fluctuate against the dollar while we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities primarily certain intercompany receivables and payables and foreign currency option contracts to hedge some foreign currency forecasted transactions primarily related to revenue generated by our operational subsidiaries our results of operations and financial condition may nonetheless be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations our reported financial results could be affected if significant changes in current accounting principles are adopted recent actions and public comments from the sec have focused on the integrity of financial reporting generally similarly congress has considered a variety of bills that could affect certain accounting principles the fasb and other regulatory accounting agencies have recently introduced several new or proposed accounting standards such as accounting for stock options some of which represent a significant change from current practices for example changes in our accounting for stock options could materially increase our reported expenses our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of the factors discussed in this report general economic conditions and other factors that may arise in the future the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us to changes in analysts’ earnings estimates to factors affecting the computer software internet entertainment media or electronics businesses or to national and international economic conditions the majority of our sales are made to a relatively small number of key customers if these customers reduce their purchases of our products or become unable to pay for them our business could be harmed in the us in fiscal 2004 over 70 percent of our sales were made to six key customers in europe our top ten customers accounted for over 35 percent of our sales in that territory in fiscal 2004 worldwide we had direct sales to one customer walmart stores inc which represented 13 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2004 though our products are available to consumers through a variety of retailers the concentration of our sales in one or a few large customers could lead to shortterm disruption in our sales if one or more of these customers significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to carry our products and could make us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers became unable to pay for our products additionally our receivables from these large customers increase significantly in the december quarter as they stock up for the holiday selling season also having such a large portion of our total net revenue concentrated in a few customers reduces our negotiating leverage with these customers 49 acquisitions investments and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties dilution to our investors and other negative consequences we have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions including 1 acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets and 2 investments in new interactive entertainment businesses for example online and mobile games any of these strategic transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations although we regularly search for opportunities to engage in strategic transactions we may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities we may not be able to consummate potential acquisitions or investments or an acquisition or investment may not enhance our business or may decrease rather than increase our earnings in addition the process of integrating an acquired company or business or successfully exploiting acquired intellectual property or other assets could divert a significant amount of our management’s time and focus and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures additional risks we face include  future acquisitions and investments could involve the issuance of our equity securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or writeoffs of goodwill any of which could harm our financial condition our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments we have begun the implementation of a common set of financial information systems throughout our worldwide organization which if not completed in a successful and timely manner could impede our ability to accurately process prepare and analyze important financial data as part of our effort to improve efficiencies throughout our worldwide organization we have begun the implementation of a common set of practices processes and financial information systems the successful conversion from our current financial information systems to new financial information systems entails a number of risks due to the complexity of the conversion and implementation process such risks include verifying the accuracy of the business data and information prior to conversion the actual conversion of that data and information to the new systems and then using that business data and information in the new systems after the conversion in addition because the implementation is companywide there is a need for substantial and comprehensive companywide employee training while testing of these new systems and processes and training of employees are done in advance of implementation there are inherent limitations in our ability to simulate a fullscale operating environment in advance of implementation finally there can be no assurance that the conversion to and the implementation of the new financial information systems will not impede our ability to accurately and timely process prepare and analyze the financial data we use in making operating decisions and which form the basis of the financial information we include in the periodic reports we file with the sec 50 our products are subject to the threat of piracy by a variety of organizations and individuals if we are not successful in combating and preventing piracy our sales and profitability could be harmed significantly in many countries around the world more pirated copies of our products are sold than legitimate copies though piracy has not had a material impact on our operating results to date highly organized pirate operations have been expanding globally in addition the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures we use in our products the availability of broadband access to the internet the ability to download pirated copies of our games from various internet sites and the widespread proliferation of internet cafes using pirated copies of our products all have contributed to ongoing and expanding piracy though we take steps to make the unauthorized copying and distribution of our products more difficult as do the manufacturers of consoles on which our games are played neither our efforts nor those of the console manufacturers may be successful in controlling the piracy of our products this could have a negative effect on our growth and profitability in the future

from time to time we hedge some of our foreign currency risk related to anticipated future sales transactions by purchasing option contracts that generally have maturities of 15 months or less if qualified these transactions are designated as cash flow hedges for the year ended march 31 2004 we recognized a loss of 16 million in earnings associated with the time value of these option contracts the counterparties to these forward and options contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks the risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are not considered to be material notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign exchange risks there can be no assurances that our mitigating activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 51 the following table provides information about our foreign currency forward and option contracts as of march 31 2004 the information is provided in us dollar equivalents and presents the notional amount forward or option amount the weightedaverage contractual foreign currency exchange rates and fair value the fair value of our forward and option contracts is recorded in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets  52 interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short average maturities though we maintain sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that we are typically able to hold our investments to maturity currently the majority of our investments are callable by the issuer as there can be no assurance as to how long these investments will be held we classify these securities as shortterm investments based on call date 

as of march 31 2004 our cash equivalents and shortterm investments included 23 billion of debt securities consisting primarily of us agency bonds money market funds and municipal securities notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations the table below presents the amounts in thousands and related weightedaverage interest rates of our investment portfolio as of march 31 2004   53

item 1 business overview   electronic arts develops markets publishes and distributes interactive software games that are playable by consumers on the following platforms  one of our strengths is our ability to publish interactive software games for multiple platforms which provides cost efficiencies in developing and marketing our products our products designed to play on consoles and handhelds are published under license from the manufacturers of these platforms for example sony for the playstation and playstation 2 microsoft for the xbox and nintendo for the gamecube and game boy advance and we pay a fee to these console manufacturers for the right to publish products on their platforms since our inception we have published games for over 42 different platforms we publish our interactive software games under three major brands  another strength of our business is that we have developed many of our products to become franchise titles that can be regularly iterated for example every year we release new versions of most of our ea sports titles likewise several of the ea games products listed above are part of new or continuing product franchises we also release products called “expansion packs” that provide additional content characters storylines settings missions for games that we have previously published for example we have published several expansion packs for the sims including the sims unleashed expansion pack and the sims vacation expansion pack each of which expands the characters settings and gameplay of the original the sims game we consider titles that iterate sequel or spawn expansion packs to be franchise titles 3 our product development methods and organization are modeled on those used in other sectors of the entertainment industry employees whom we call “producers” are responsible for overseeing the development of one or more products the interactive software games that we publish under our brands are developed by    we invest in the creation of stateoftheart software tools that we use in product development these tools allow for more costeffective product development and the ability to more efficiently convert products from one platform to another we have also made investments in facilities and equipment that allow us to create and edit video and audio recordings that are used in our games   we also distribute interactive software games that are published by other companies which we refer to as “distribution products” an example of a recent distribution product is kingdom hearts which is published by square co ltd the console pc and handheld games that we publish are made available to consumers on a disk usually a cd or dvd format or a cartridge that is packaged and typically sold in retail stores and through our own online store we refer to these as packaged goods products in north america and europe our largest markets these packaged goods products are sold primarily to retailers that may be mass market retailers such as walmart electronics specialty stores such as best buy or game software specialty stores such as electronics boutique in japan we also sell a significant volume of our products through a distributor who in turn sells them to retailers our products are available in approximately 80000 retail locations worldwide we also maintain a smaller business in which we license to manufacturers of products in related industries for example makers of personal computers or computer accessories rights to include certain of our products with the manufacturer’s product or offer our products to consumers who have purchased the manufacturer’s product we call these combined products “oem bundles” there are three ways in which we publish games that are playable online by consumers first we include online features in our pc and playstation 2 products for example by enabling consumers to play against one another over the internet we also publish games that are playable only online one type of these onlineonly games is called “persistent state worlds” or massively multiplayer games consumers experience these games as interactive virtual worlds where thousands of other consumers can interact with one another examples of our persistent state world products are ultima online earth  beyond and the sims online  these persistent state world games are often sold to consumers in the form of a cd or dvd that contains much of the software necessary to play the game online the other type of onlineonly games that we publish are electronic card games puzzle games and word games marketed under the “pogo” brand that we make available to consumers on our website wwweacom and on certain online services provided by america online inc in fiscal 2003 we operated and reported our business in two business segments  as of april 1 2003 we are no longer managing these segments separately we consider online functionality to be integral to our existing and future products 4 during fiscal 2003 our business was comprised of the following    of the titles shipped in fiscal 2003 there were 22 titles that sold over one million units aggregated across all platforms in fiscal 2003 approximately 42 percent of our net revenue was generated by international operations compared to approximately 37 percent in both fiscal 2002 and 2001   we were initially incorporated in california in 1982 in september 1991 we were reincorporated under the laws of delaware our principal executive offices are located at 209 redwood shores parkway redwood city california 94065 and our telephone number is 650 6281500 we file various reports with or furnish them to the sec these reports are available free of charge on our website wwweacom as soon as reasonably practicable after

product names are trademarks of ours or others our products may contain voices and likenesses of third parties and the musical compositions and performances of third parties our products may also contain other content licensed from third parties such as trademarks fictional characters storylines and software code   we acquire intellectual property rights to include in our products through license agreements such as those with the sports leagues and player associations with movie studios and performing talent with music labels and musicians these licenses are typically limited to use of the licensed rights in specific products for specific time periods in addition our products for play on videogame platforms such as the sony playstation 2 console include intellectual properties owned by the platform company and licensed nonexclusively to us for use while we may have renewal rights for some licenses our business is significantly dependent on our ability to continue to obtain the intellectual property rights from third parties needed for many of our products   our products are susceptible to unauthorized copying our primary protection against unauthorized use duplication and distribution of our products is copyright and trademark we typically own the copyright to the software code as well as the brand or title name trademark under which our products are marketed we register our copyrights in the united states and register our significant trademarks in multiple countries including the united states in addition console manufacturers such as sony typically incorporate security devices in their consoles in an effort to prevent unlicensed use of products joint ventures and investments   joint ventures   in may 1998 we entered into a joint venture with square co ltd “square” a leading developer and publisher of entertainment software in japan 

 5  our joint venture agreements with square expired as of march 31 2003 as provided in the ea square kk joint venture agreement we have purchased square’s 30 percent interest in ea square kk for 25 million representing the return of their capital contribution and renamed the entity electronic arts kk electronic arts kk is now a wholly owned subsidiary of electronic arts see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 hereof as a further result of the termination of the joint venture agreements our distribution of square products in north america will terminate on june 30 2003 we generated 845 million 808 million and 1066 million in net revenue from sales of square products in north america during fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively   investments   we have made investments as part of our overall strategy and currently hold minority equity interests in several companies as of march 31 2003 our minority equity investments include investments in digital illusions ce novalogic inc and firaxis software inc 

market   historically there have been multiple consoles available in the market and vigorous competition between console manufacturers while sony has for the past several years been the clear market leader with its playstation and playstation 2 consoles microsoft and nintendo are large and viable competitors and pcs continue to be strong interactive game platform we develop and publish products for multiple platforms and this diversification continues to be a cornerstone of our strategy   the following table details select information on a sample of the console platforms for which we have published titles    playstation 2   sony released the playstation 2 console in japan in march 2000 in north america in october 2000 and in europe in november 2000 the playstation 2 console is a 128bit dvdbased system that is internet and cable ready as well as backward compatible with games published for its predecessor the playstation we have published and are currently developing numerous products for the sony playstation 2 

  gamecube   nintendo launched the nintendo gamecube console in japan in september 2001 north america in november 2001 and in europe in may 2002 the nintendo gamecube plays games that are manufactured on a proprietary optical disk we have published and are currently developing several products for the nintendo gamecube 

6   xbox   microsoft launched the xbox console in north america in november 2001 in japan in february 2002 and in europe in march 2002 the microsoft xbox is a 128bit dvdbased system we have published and are currently developing several products for the microsoft xbox 

  our early investment in products designed for play on 32bit pcs and consoles such as the playstation has been strategically important in positioning us for the current generation of 128bit machines we believe that such investment continues to be important during fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 the video and computer games industry has experienced a platform transition from 32bit cdbased and 64bit cartridgebased consoles to the current generation of 128bit dvdbased game consoles and related software the transition to the current generation systems was initiated by the launch of sony’s playstation 2 in fiscal 2001 and continued with the launches of the nintendo gamecube and microsoft’s xbox in fiscal 2002 as the market continues to shift to the current generation systems our sales of 32bit and 64bit products have been declining and we expect a continued significant decline in fiscal 2004   online games   the market for online games is still in its early stages to date we have had limited success in finding ways of generating revenue and profits from online games including subscription fees “paytoplay fees” and advertising in addition we have had limited experience with developing optimal pricing strategies or predicting usage patterns for our online games in our history we have launched five persistent state world products with mixed results while we have achieved success with ultima online the launch of our other persistent state world products most notably the sims online and earth  beyond have been below our expectations in fiscal 2003 we also launched a free ea sports online offering in connection with seven of our pc sports titles despite our limited success to date we believe that online functionality is integral to our existing and future products the continued growth of the online sector of our industry will depend on the following key factors 

 competition   the interactive entertainment software business is highly competitive it is characterized by the continuous introduction of new titles and the development of new technologies our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large diversified corporations with greater financial and marketing resources than ours our business is driven by hit titles which require everincreasing budgets for development and marketing therefore the availability of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in our industry primarily as a result of the costs associated with the development and marketing of game software competition in our industry is also based on product quality and features timing of product releases brandname recognition access to distribution channels effectiveness of marketing and price   we compete with sony microsoft and nintendo which each publish software for their respective console platforms we also compete with numerous companies which are like us licensed by the console manufacturers to develop and publish software games that operate on their consoles these competitors include acclaim entertainment activision capcom eidos infogrames konami lucas arts midway namco sega taketwo interactive thq 3do ubi soft and vivendi universal games among others in addition we believe that large software companies and media companies are increasing their focus in the interactive entertainment software market our titles also compete with other forms of entertainment such as motion pictures television and music for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers 7   in addition the market for our products is characterized by significant price competition and we face increasing pricing pressures from our competitors these pressures have from time to time required us to reduce our prices on certain products the experience of our industry is that software game prices decline once a generation of consoles have been in the market for a significant period of time because of the increasing number of software titles competing for acceptance by consumers accordingly we expect lower overall pricing of games for the playstation 2 xbox and nintendo gamecube during fiscal 2004 in comparison to fiscal 2003 however we believe that highlyanticipated “hit” titles based on popular sports and entertainment properties will maintain premium pricing in the market in fiscal 2004 as they have done in fiscal 2003   during calendar 2002 we were a market leader in sales of interactive entertainment software products for the sony playstation 2 the nintendo gamecube the microsoft xbox and personal computers in the aggregate in the us and european markets in the us together with our affiliates we published three of the top10selling titles for play on videogame consoles and five of the top10 pc titles according to npdfunworld and npd techworld our nearest competitors had two of the top10 videogame and pc titles for the same period according to npdfunworld and npd techworld while similar comprehensive data are not available for europe we believe that our titles had similar chart strength for the playstation 2 and pc in that territory in calendar year 2002 relationships with significant hardware platform companies   sony   in fiscal 2003 approximately 37 percent of our net revenue was derived from sales of ea studio software for the playstation 2 compared to 28 percent in fiscal 2002 we released 19 titles worldwide in fiscal 2003 for the playstation 2 compared to 18 titles in fiscal 2002 key releases for the year included medal of honor frontline ™  the lord of the rings ™  the two towers ™  harry potter and the chamber of secrets ™ and the sims  playstation 2 product revenue increased for fiscal 2003 due to the higher installed base of playstation 2 hardware net revenue on key titles released in multiple territories during the current fiscal year and higher net revenue on current year franchise title releases versus prior year releases of these titles we expect revenue from playstation 2 products to continue to grow in fiscal 2004 but as revenue for these products increase we expect our growth rates to decrease we expect that hit titles will continue to hold their current price points however we expect lower price points for other titles under the terms of a licensing agreement entered into with sony computer entertainment of america as of april 2000 as amended we are authorized to develop and distribute dvdbased software products compatible with the playstation 2 pursuant to this agreement we engage sony to supply playstation 2 dvds for our products 

  we also announced in may 2003 that we would make many of our sports games available for the playstation 2 online service through that service customers who have any online adaptor for their playstation 2 consoles will be able to play our playstation 2 sports products online   in fiscal 2003 approximately four percent of our net revenue was derived from sales of ea studio software for the playstation compared to 11 percent in fiscal 2002 during fiscal 2003 we released six playstation games compared to five in fiscal 2002 as expected playstation product sales decreased for fiscal 2003 compared to the prior year primarily attributable to the market transition to next generation console systems although our playstation products are playable on the playstation 2 console we expect sales of current playstation products to continue to decline in fiscal 2004 under the terms of a licensing agreement entered into with sony computer entertainment of america in july 1994 as amended we are authorized to develop and distribute cdbased software products compatible with the playstation pursuant to this agreement we engage sony to supply playstation cds for our products   nintendo   in fiscal 2003 approximately seven percent of our net revenue was derived from sales of ea studio software for the nintendo gamecube compared to three percent in fiscal 2002 we released 17 titles worldwide in fiscal 2003 for the nintendo gamecube compared to five titles in fiscal 2002 key releases 

8 for the year included harry potter and the chamber of secrets medal of honor frontline need for speed hot pursuit 2 and the lord of the rings the two towers  revenue from nintendo gamecube products increased for fiscal 2003 due to the higher installed base of the nintendo gamecube platform which is now available in every major market in which we operate in the prior fiscal year the nintendo gamecube platform was only available in north america beginning in november 2001 and in japan beginning in september 2001 we expect revenue from nintendo gamecube products to continue to grow in fiscal 2004 but as revenue for these products increases we expect our growth rates to decrease we expect that hit titles will continue to hold their current price points however we expect lower price points for other titles 

  under the terms of a licensing agreement entered into with nintendo of america effective as of november 1 2001 we are authorized to develop and distribute proprietary optical format disk products compatible with the nintendo gamecube pursuant to this agreement we engage nintendo to supply nintendo gamecube proprietary optical format disk products for our products   microsoft   in fiscal 2003 approximately nine percent of our net revenue was derived from sales of ea studio software for the xbox compared to five percent in fiscal 2002 we released 16 titles worldwide in fiscal 2003 for the xbox compared to ten titles in fiscal 2002 key releases for the year included medal of honor frontline ncaa football 2003 the lord of the rings the two towers and fifa 2003  revenue from xbox products increased for fiscal 2003 due to the higher installed base of the xbox platform which was available for a full twelve months versus five months in fiscal 2002 we expect net revenue from xbox products to continue to grow in fiscal 2004 but as net revenue for these products increases we expect our growth rates to decrease we expect that hit titles will continue to hold their current price points however we expect lower price points for other titles 

  under the terms of a licensing agreement entered into with microsoft as of december 8 2000 as amended we are authorized to develop and distribute dvdbased software products compatible with the xbox   in may 2003 we announced that we have no plans to support the online service for xbox it is unclear whether the absence of online functionality in our xbox products will be important enough to consumers to affect sales of our xbox products relationship with aol   our carriage agreement with aol establishes the basis for our creation and distribution of game sites on the world wide web that are available to aol subscribers via the games channel on aol’s flagship isp service and to other consumers who use other aol portals  aolcom compuserve netscape netcenter and icq  users can also access our online games website directly from the world wide web at wwweacom we are aol’s exclusive provider of a broad aggregation of online games and programs and we manage all of the games channel content within aol’s flagship isp service and other aol portals in the united states within any of these aol properties users will be able to find a games channel or area which will provide the user access to our online games see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 hereof for a discussion of the significant terms of our relationship with aol products and product development   in fiscal 2003 we generated approximately 68 percent of our revenue from ea studioproduced products released during the year as of march 31 2003 we were actively marketing approximately 70 titles comprising over 135 stock keeping units or skus that were produced by ea studios during fiscal 2003 we introduced 31 ea studios titles representing 86 skus compared to 32 ea studios titles comprising 64 skus in fiscal 2002 in fiscal 2003 we had 22 titles that sold over one million units aggregated across all platforms in fiscal 2002 we had 16 titles and in fiscal 2001 we had 14 titles that 9 sold over one million units aggregated across all platforms a sku is a version of a title designed for play on a particular platform and intended for distribution in a particular territory 

  the products produced by ea studios are designed and created by our employee designers and artists and by nonemployee software developers “independent artists” we typically advance development funds to the independent artists during development of our games which payments are considered advances against subsequent royalties based on the sales of the products these terms are typically set forth in written agreements entered into with the independent artists   for fiscal 2003 we had one title harry potter and the chamber of secrets published on seven different platforms which represented approximately 10 percent of our total fiscal 2003 net revenue for fiscal 2002 harry potter and the sorcerer’s stone™  published on four different platforms represented approximately 12 percent of our total fiscal 2002 net revenue for fiscal 2001 no title represented more than 10 percent of our total fiscal 2001 net revenue   we publish products in a number of categories such as sports action strategy simulations role playing and adventure each of which is becoming increasingly competitive our sportsrelated products marketed under the ea sports™ brand name accounted for a significant percentage of net revenue in fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our market share in the sports category   the frontline retail selling prices in north america of our products excluding older titles marketed as “classics” typically range from 3000 to 5000 “classics” titles have retail selling prices that range from 1000 to 3000 the retail selling prices of our titles outside of north america vary widely based on local market conditions   we currently develop or publish products for six different hardware platforms in fiscal 2003 our product releases were for playstation 2 pc xbox playstation nintendo gamecube game boy advance game boy color and online internet play our planned product introductions for fiscal 2004 are for the playstation 2 pc nintendo gamecube xbox playstation and game boy advance   our goal is to be the market leader of games played on the current generation of 128bit video game consoles we are investing in the development of tools and technologies designed to facilitate development of our products for these platforms we had research and development expenditures of 4010 million in fiscal 2003 3806 million in fiscal 2002 and 3762 million in fiscal 2001   eacom web site   free content we offer free games on our website under the following four brands pogo ea games™ ea sports™ and ea sports big™ the majority of these free games are original games designed solely for online play while some of the product offerings capitalize on our existing franchises adapted for online play as of march 31 2003 the product offerings within each brand incorporate some or all of the following 

 10   paid content in addition to free online games we offer premium paytoplay persistent state world games in order to access these premium games the player must purchase a cdrom through retail stores or through our online store after an initial free trial period the player must pay a subscription fee in order to continue playing these persistent state world games are designed to appeal to avid gamers teens and adults looking to participate in multiplayer online games made up of fantastic worlds characters adventures or activities – big or small real or imagined – as well as new forms of cuttingedge online entertainment targeted to mass market gamers current persistent state world game offerings include ultima online the sims online and earth  beyond    we launched both earth  beyond and the sims online in fiscal 2003 the sims online was expected to be our flagship online subscription offering through march 31 2003 however the number of units sold and number of subscribers for the sims online and earth  beyond have been below our expectations see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the restructuring and asset impairment charges included in item 8 hereof   each of the categories above focuses on targeting and serving its specific consumer group by  marketing and distribution   electronic arts distribution   ea studio products we market the products produced by our ea studios under the ea games ea sports and ea sports big brands products marketed under the ea sports brand typically simulate professional and collegiate sports and include titles such as madden nfl fifa and nba live  products marketed under the ea sports big brand typically simulates extreme sports and include such titles as ssx def jam vendetta and nba street  

  copublishing and distribution products copublishing products are games that are conceived and developed by independent developers and for which we provide production assistance and marketing and distribution services we publish some of these products under an ea brand distribution products are titles that are published by another publisher and delivered to us as completed products for which we provide distribution services as of march 31 2003 we distributed approximately 34 copublishing and distribution titles in north america   our largest relationship relating to distribution products is with square in may 1998 electronic arts and square formed a joint venture in north america creating square ea as discussed in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 hereof in conjunction with the formation of this joint venture we have since that time had the exclusive right in north america to distribute products published by this joint venture our joint venture agreements with square expired as of march 31 2003 and our distribution of square products in north america will cease on june 30 2003 in fiscal 2003 square ea published kingdom hearts for the playstation 2 which was a topten selling sku selling over one million units   the interactive software game business has become increasingly “hits” driven requiring significantly greater expenditures for marketing and advertising of our products particularly for television advertising there can be no assurance that we will continue to produce “hit” titles or that advertising for any product will increase sales sufficiently to recoup those advertising expenses   we generated approximately 95 percent of our north american net revenue from direct sales to retailers through a field sales organization of professionals and a group of telephone sales representatives the remaining 5 percent of our north american sales were made through a limited number of specialized 11 and regional distributors and rack jobbers in markets where we believe direct sales would not be economical we had sales to one customer walmart stores inc which represented 12 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2003 14 percent in fiscal 2002 and 12 percent in fiscal 2001 

  outside of north america we derive revenues primarily from direct sales to retailers our largest distributor relationship is with sony in japan sales of our playstation and playstation 2 products through sony make up approximately 60 percent of our net revenue in japan under the terms of our distribution agreement with sony we are not required to accept returns or grant price protection in a few of our smaller markets we also sell our products through distributors with whom we have written agreements or informal arrangements depending on the business customs of the territories   in north america we have stockbalancing programs for our pc products which allow for the exchange of pc products by resellers under certain circumstances in all of our major geographical markets other than japan we may decide to provide price protection under certain circumstances for both our pc and console products after we analyze inventory remaining in the channel the rate of inventory sellthrough in the channel and our remaining inventory on hand it is our policy to exchange products or give credits rather than give cash refunds moreover the risk of product returns for our products on mature platforms such as the playstation may increase as newer hardware platforms such as the xbox nintendo gamecube and playstation 2 become more popular we monitor and manage the volume of our sales to retailers and distributors and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel can result in high returns or the requirement for substantial price protection in subsequent periods we believe that we provide adequate reserves for returns and price protection which are based on estimated future returns of products taking into account historical returns current sellthrough of distributor and retailer inventory of our products current trends in the interactive game market and the overall economy changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors we believe our current reserves will be sufficient to meet return and price protection requirements for current inchannel inventory however we cannot be certain that actual returns or price protection will not exceed our reserves   the distribution channels through which our games are sold have been characterized by change including consolidations and financial difficulties of certain distributors and retailers the bankruptcy or other business difficulties of a distributor or retailer could render our accounts receivable from such entity uncollectible which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition in january 2002 one of our retail customers kmart declared bankruptcy we believe we have adequately reserved for our exposure to kmart in addition an increasing number of companies are competing for access to our distribution channels our arrangements with our distributors and retailers may be terminated by either party at any time without cause distributors and retailers often carry products that compete with ours retailers of our products typically have a limited amount of shelf space and promotional resources that they are willing to devote to the software games category and there is intense competition for these resources there can be no assurance that distributors and retailers will continue to purchase our products or provide our products with adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support   within our website we offer visitors the opportunity to purchase our packaged goods software products directly from us we use our existing distribution network to fulfill consumers’ online orders we also have a fulfillment group that sells product directly to consumers through a tollfree number and through our websites listed in advertising by us and our copublishing and distribution affiliates this group is also responsible for targeted directmail marketing and sells product backups and accessories to registered customers inventory and working capital   our management focuses considerable attention to managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers prior to the release of our products and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct and territorybyterritory basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that match this forecasted 12 demand we do not maintain substantial inventories of our products because 1 historically most of the sales of a particular product occur within the first 60 – 90 days after the product’s release and 2 the lead times on reorders of our products are generally short approximately two to three weeks further as discussed in “marketing and distribution” we have practices in place with our customers such as stock balancing and price protection that reduce product returns 

  as shown in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report we had approximately 9500 million in cash and cash equivalents and 6376 million in shortterm investments as of march 31 2003 we believe that this amount is sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the coming year segment reporting in fiscal 2003 we operated and reviewed our business in two business segments  as of april 1 2003 we are no longer managing these segments separately we consider online functionality to be integral to our existing and future products please see the discussion regarding segment reporting in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in items 7 and 8 hereof international operations   we have whollyowned subsidiaries throughout the world including offices in the united kingdom france spain germany australia canada south africa singapore sweden japan malaysia brazil and holland our joint venture in japan has recently been converted to a wholly owned subsidiary as a result of our buyout of our joint venture partner see the discussion under “joint ventures and investments” included above the amounts of net revenue operating profit and identifiable assets attributable to each of our geographic regions for each of the last three fiscal years are set forth in note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 hereof   international net revenue increased by 66 percent to 10465 million or 42 percent of consolidated fiscal 2003 net revenue compared to 6314 million or 37 percent of consolidated fiscal 2002 net revenue due to the following  13    although we expect international revenue to grow in fiscal 2004 we do not believe it will continue to grow at the same rate as in the prior year manufacturing and suppliers   the suppliers we use for manufacture of our games can be characterized in three types  in many instances we are able to acquire materials on a volumediscount basis we have multiple potential sources of supply for most materials except with respect to our playstation playstation 2 xbox and nintendo gamecube products as discussed in “relationships with significant hardware platform companies” above we also have alternate sources for the manufacture and assembly of most of our products to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in production of our software and related documentation and packaging however a shortage of components or other factors beyond our control could impair our ability to manufacture or have manufactured our products backlog   we typically ship orders immediately upon receipt to the extent that any backlog may or may not exist at the end of a reporting period it would be both coincidental and an unreliable indicator of future results of any period seasonality   our business is highly seasonal we typically experience our highest revenue and profits in the calendar yearend holiday season and a seasonal low in revenue and profits in the quarter ending in june employees   as of march 31 2003 we employed approximately 4000 people of whom over 1700 were outside the united states we believe that our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is an important factor in our growth and development and that our future success will depend in large measure on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees to date we have been successful in recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified personnel to conduct our business successfully we believe that our relationships with our employees are good none of our employees are represented by a union guild or other collective bargaining organization tracking stock   on march 22 2000 the stockholders of electronic arts authorized the issuance of a new series of common stock designated as class b common stock “tracking stock” the tracking stock was intended to reflect the performance of our online and ecommerce business segment when we adopted the tracking stock our intention was to provide liquidity for our online business through access to the 14 public markets however as a result of the disappointing performance of our online business we have no plans nor do we see meaningful prospects for the creation of a public market for our class b common stock therefore we will discontinue separate reporting of our tracking stock in future reporting periods we expect this decision to simplify our reporting and enable us to provide our online products and services more efficiently maintaining separate reporting for the tracking stock and managing our online business as a separate reporting business segment required a complex organization and management structure in addition a variety of intercompany agreements between electronic arts inc and eacom inc a wholly owned subsidiary of electronic arts inc that is the holder of all of our online business related assets have required us to maintain duplicate functions to routinely charge each organization for goods and services that it provided to the other organization and to manage our online business in a manner that is generally unlike the way in which we manage our other businesses we now consider online functionality to be integral to our existing and future products accordingly as of april 1 2003 we have consolidated the reporting related to our online products and services into that of our core business and now manage these online products and services as part of the overall development and publication of our other products we believe that this better reflects the way in which our chief operating decision maker reviews and manages our business and the importance of our online products and services relative to the rest of our business at the same time in light of the disappointing launch of the sims online we evaluated our online products and services and the assets associated with eacom for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we recorded a

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities contingent assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses during the reporting period the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown as a result actual results may differ materially from our estimates sales allowances and bad debt reserves we principally derive revenue from sales of packaged interactive software games designed for play on videogame consoles such as the playstation 2 xbox and nintendo gamecube pcs and handheld game machines such as the nintendo game boy advance product revenue is recognized net of sales allowances we also have stockbalancing programs for our personal computer products which allow for the exchange of personal computer products by resellers under certain circumstances we may decide to provide price protection for both our personal computer and video game system products in making this determination we evaluate inventory remaining in the channel the rate of inventory sellthrough in the channel and our remaining inventory on hand it is our policy to exchange products or give credits rather than give cash refunds 

we estimate potential future product returns price protection and stockbalancing programs related to current period product revenue we analyze historical returns current sellthrough of distributor and retailer inventory of our products current trends in the video game market and the overall economy changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and price protection allowances in addition management monitors and manages the volume of our sales to retailers and distributors and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel can result in high returns or the requirement for substantial price protection in subsequent periods in the past actual returns have not generally exceeded our reserves however actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms product updates or competing products for example the risk of product returns for our products may increase as the xbox nintendo gamecube and playstation 2 consoles pass the midpoint of their lifecycle and an increasing number and aggregate amount of competitive products heighten pricing and competitive pressures while management believes it can make reliable estimates for these matters if we changed our assumptions and estimates our returns reserves would change which would impact the net revenue we report for example if actual returns were significantly greater than the reserves we have established the actual results would decrease our reported revenue conversely if actual returns were significantly less than our reserves this would increase our reported revenue similarly significant judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers the amount and timing of our bad debt expense could change significantly we cannot predict customer bankruptcies or an inability of any of our customers to meet their financial obligations to us therefore our estimates could differ materially from actual results our gross accounts receivable balance was 2467 million and our allowance for product returns pricing allowances and doubtful accounts was 1646 million as of march 31 2003 as of march 31 2002 our gross accounts receivable balance was 3064 million and our allowance for product returns pricing 24 allowances and doubtful accounts was 1159 million reserves for bad debts and sales allowances increased 42 percent from 1159 million at march 31 2002 to 1646 million at march 31 2003 the increase in the overall reserves as of march 31 2003 is due to the increase in gross revenue in the six and 12 months ended march 31 2003 compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year net revenue increased 44 percent during fiscal 2003 due to the higher installed base of playstation 2 consoles and having a full year of sales of games for the xbox and nintendo gamecube the increase in price protection and sales returns is directly attributable to the increase in sales that occurred during fiscal 2003 sales return and price protection requirements as a percentage of gross revenue in the six and 12 months ended march 31 2003 have remained relatively constant compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year we have recorded reserves for returns of product and price protection credits issued for products sold in prior periods we believe these reserves are adequate based on historical experience and our current estimate of potential returns and allowances 

prepaid royalties prepaid royalties consist primarily of prepayments we make for manufacturing royalties advances paid to our copublishing andor distribution affiliates and license fees paid to celebrities professional sports organizations and other organizations for our use of their trade name and content also included in prepaid royalties are prepayments made to independent software developers under development arrangements that have alternative future uses prepaid royalties are expensed at the contractual or effective royalty rate as cost of goods sold based on actual net product sales we evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties quarterly and charge to cost of goods sold any product postlaunch amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales any impairments on prelaunch advances are charged to research and development expense we rely on forecasted revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties if actual revenue or revised sales forecasts fall below the initial forecasted sales the charge may be larger than anticipated in any given quarter once the charge has been taken that amount will not be expensed in future quarters when the product has shipped the current portion of prepaid royalties included in other current assets was 399 million at march 31 2003 and 655 million at march 31 2002 the longterm portion of prepaid royalties included in other assets was 74 million at march 31 2003 and 12 million at march 31 2002 

valuation of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate both purchased intangible assets and longlived assets in order to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate an otherthantemporary impairment in value this evaluation requires us to estimate among other things the remaining useful lives along with future estimates of cash flows of the business all require the use of judgment and estimates our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates 

under current accounting standards we make judgments about the remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an otherthantemporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet in order to determine if an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred management makes various assumptions about the future value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash flows our future net cash flows are primarily dependent on the sale of products for play on proprietary video game platforms the success of our products is affected by our ability to accurately predict which platforms and which products we develop will be successful also our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules due to product sales shortfalls we may not realize the future net cash flows necessary to recover our longlived assets which may result in an impairment charge recorded in the future we recorded asset impairment charges of 663 million during fiscal 2003 and 128 million during fiscal 2002 see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 hereof for a discussion of the asset impairment charges recorded on april 1 2002 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets”  as a result of adopting this standard we will continue to amortize finitelived intangibles but no longer amortize certain other intangible assets most notably goodwill in 25 lieu of amortization sfas no 142 requires a twostep approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit the first step which was required to be completed by september 30 2002 tests for impairment by applying fair valuebased tests at the company’s reporting unit level the second step if necessary required to be completed by march 31 2003 measures the amount of impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit we completed the first step of transitional goodwill impairment testing during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and found no indicators of impairment of our recorded goodwill as a result we have recognized no transitional impairment loss in fiscal 2003 in connection with the adoption of sfas no 142 we completed the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 with a measurement date of january 1 2003 and found no indicators of impairment of our recorded goodwill future impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings and there is a potential for a write down of goodwill in connection with the annual impairment test following adoption of sfas no 142 we continue to evaluate whether any event has occurred which might indicate that the carrying value of an intangible asset is not recoverable 

income taxes in the ordinary course of the company’s business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact if any of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations and making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is established to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve to determine the quarterly tax rate we are required to estimate fullyear income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction the estimated effective tax rate is adjusted for the tax related to significant unusual items changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective tax rate

playstation 2 titles increased in fiscal 2003 by 89 percent to 9107 million versus 4829 million in the prior fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the following  we expect revenue from

million versus 4563 million in the prior fiscal year the increase was primarily due to strong sales of the sims franchise titles and the release of simcity 4  for a combined increase of 710 million partially offset by lower net revenue on prior year releases black and white and dune emperor totaling 322 million  we expect revenue from pc products to be relatively flat in fiscal 2004  net revenue from sales of xbox products increased in fiscal 2003 by 180 percent to 2194 million versus 784 million in the prior fiscal period the increase was primarily due to the following  we expect net revenue

million versus 517 million in the prior fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the following  we expect net revenue from nintendo gamecube products to continue to grow in fiscal 2004 but for the rate of growth to decrease  as we expected the decrease in revenue from sales of playstation titles in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was attributable to the market transition to newer generation console systems although our playstation products are playable on the playstation 2 console we expect sales of current playstation products to continue to decline in fiscal 2004   31   we expected the sims online to be our flagship online subscription offering through march 31 2003 however the number of units sold and number of subscribers for the sims online and earth  beyond have been below our expectations as a result we canceled most of our plans to develop similar online products and have consolidated the operations of our online games business into our core business see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 hereof  net revenue from copublishing products and distribution products increased 40 percent to 3758 million in fiscal

consider online functionality to be integral to our existing and future products accordingly 32 beginning april 1 2003 we no longer manage our online products and services as a separate business segment and we will consolidate the reporting related to our online products and services into reporting for the overall development and publication of our core products for all reporting periods ending after that date we believe that this will better reflect the way in which our chief operating decision maker reviews and manages our business and reflects the importance of our online products and services relative to the rest of our business we believe we will only have one reportable segment in fiscal 2004 as a result of restructuring the eacom business concurrently we will also eliminate

vendor reimbursements received in fiscal 2001 general and administrative in thousands  general and administrative expenses increased 29 percent in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 primarily attributed to  research and development in thousands  46 research and development expenses increased slightly in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 primarily attributable to  these increases were offset by  amortization of intangibles in thousands  amortization of intangibles results primarily from amortizing purchased goodwill and intangibles associated with acquisitions including westwood kesmai dreamworks interactive abc software and pogo corporation amortization of purchased goodwill and intangibles was 129 million for the ea core business segment and 125 million for the eacom business segment for fiscal 2002 amortization of intangibles was 128 million for the ea core business segment and 65 million for the eacom business segment for fiscal 2001 the increase in amortization of intangibles in fiscal 2002 for the eacom business segment compared to the prior year was due to our acquisition of pogo corporation in february 2001 in addition we recorded intangible impairment charges of 16 million in fiscal 2002 relating to our restructuring of our online business charge for acquired inprocess technology in thousands  in connection with the acquisition of pogo corporation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 we allocated and expensed 27 million of the 433 million purchase price to acquired inprocess technology at the date of the closing of the acquisition this amount was expensed as a nonrecurring charge as the inprocess technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses pogo had various projects in progress at the time of the acquisition as of the acquisition date costs to complete pogo projects acquired were expected to be approximately 12 million in future periods during fiscal 2002 all of these development projects were completed and launched on our pogo online games sites in conjunction with the acquisition of pogo we accrued approximately 01 million related to direct transaction and other related costs we recorded this charge after concluding that the inprocess technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use after taking into consideration the potential for usage of the software in different products and resale of the software 47 restructuring and asset impairment charges in thousands  during fiscal 2002 we announced a restructuring plan for the eacom business segment to reduce its workforce and consolidate facilities the restructuring and resulting asset impairment charges were necessary in order to focus on key online priorities and reduce the eacom

administrative charges and 128 million for the writeoff of noncurrent assets as a direct result of the restructuring we will make adjustments to the restructuring reserves in future periods if necessary based upon events and circumstances that we encounter in the future the restructuring plan resulted in the termination of approximately 270 employees or onethird of the workforce of the eacom business segment which affected all departments across the organization the estimated costs for consolidation of facilities are comprised of contractual rental commitments under real estate leases for unutilized office space offset by estimated future sublease income included in these costs are estimated costs to close offices or consolidate facilities in various locations and costs to write off a portion of the assets from these facilities in addition the restructuring efforts required an evaluation of asset impairment in accordance with sfas no 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of”  to adjust these depreciable assets and certain intangibles to their estimated fair value management evaluated the impact of consolidating or abandoning certain online technologies and processes and reviewed the effect of changes to our subscription online product offerings in relation to the eacom segment’s asset base as a result it was determined that certain longlived assets would be abandoned or were related to products or services that had been discontinued and would therefore be writtendown to their estimated net disposal value we recorded impairment charges on longlived assets of 128 million including 112 million relating to consolidated or abandoned technologies for our online game site infrastructure and 16 million of goodwill and intangibles impairment charges relating to our san diego and kesmai online games development studios these impairment factors may change in subsequent periods and accordingly we may record additional impairment charges in future periods interest and other income net in thousands  interest and other income net decreased by 239 percent primarily due to lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2002 and an increase in the cost of utilizing foreign exchange hedge contracts income taxes in thousands  our effective tax rate was 310 percent for fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 at march 31 2002 we generated a federal income tax net operating loss this loss will be carried forward to future tax years at march 31 2001 we also generated a federal income tax net operating loss we used a substantial portion of this loss in a carryback claim with the remainder being carried forward the net operating losses for both fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 resulted from losses from our eacom business segment operations as well as stock 48 option deductions we did not establish a valuation allowance on these loss carryforwards or other net deferred tax assets as we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize them 

net income loss in thousands  reported net income loss increased in fiscal 2002 primarily due to higher net revenue partially offset by higher expenses compared to fiscal 2001 the increase in expenses was primarily due to increases in marketing and advertising costs to support a higher number of franchise titles expenses were also higher in fiscal 2002 due to restructuring and asset impairment charges discussed above 49 liquidity and capital resources   as of march 31 2003 our working capital was 134 billion compared to 6996 million at march 31 2002 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased by 7907 million in fiscal 2003 we generated 7145 million of cash from operations 1317 million of cash through the sale of equity securities under our stock plans and used 591 million of cash in capital expenditures during fiscal 2003   our principal source of liquidity is 159 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and 11 million in marketable securities at march 31 2003 we believe the existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and investment requirements for at least the next 12 months however our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those related to customer demand and acceptance of titles on new platforms and new title versions on existing platforms our ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due successfully achieving our product release schedules and attaining our forecasted sales objectives the impact of competition the economic conditions in the domestic and international markets seasonality in operating results risks of product returns and the other risks listed in the “risk factors” section eacom business segment   included in the amounts above is the following for the eacom business segment

53 in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” “fin 46” this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51 “consolidated financial statements ” addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities “vies” that either i do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or ii the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest this interpretation applies immediately to vies created after january 31 2003 it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june 15 2003 to vies in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february 1 2003 fin 46 requires disclosure of vies in financial statements issued after january 31 2003 if it is reasonably possible that as of the transition date i the company will be the primary beneficiary of an existing vie that will require consolidation or ii the company will hold a significant variable interest in or have significant involvement with an existing vie we do not believe that we will have any entities that will require disclosure or new consolidation as a result of adopting the provisions of fin 46 in january 2003 the emerging issues task force “eitf” reached consensus on issue no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables”  eitf 0021 provides guidance on how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables requires that such deliverables be accounted for separately eitf 0021 allows for prospective adoption for arrangements entered into after june 15 2003 or adoption via a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principal we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of eitf 0021 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 54  

risk factors   electronic arts’ business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance these risks and uncertainties are discussed below there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs our business and financial performance could be harmed and the market value of our securities could decline if we do not develop products for widelyaccepted new video game platforms our business will suffer   we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play on proprietary video game platforms of third parties such as sony’s playstation 2 therefore the success of our products is driven in large part by the success of new video game hardware systems and our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be most successful in the marketplace we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of a new platform a new platform for which we are developing products may be delayed may not succeed or may have a shorter life cycle than anticipated if the platforms for which we are developing products are not released when anticipated or do not attain wide market acceptance our revenue growth will suffer if we do not accurately predict the importance to consumers of online game play for different console products our sales may be limited in the future   sony and microsoft have introduced online game play for their respective playstation 2 and xbox consoles we anticipate that nintendo will do so for its gamecube console we have agreed to support online game features for our sony playstation 2 products but do not currently offer similar capability for our xbox products we currently cannot predict the importance to consumers of these features if consumers consider online play capability to be a significant component of games for the xbox our sales of products for the xbox would decline our business is both seasonal and cyclical if we fail to deliver our products at the right times our sales will suffer   our business is highly seasonal with the highest levels of consumer demand and a significant percentage of our revenue occurring in the december quarter the timing of hardware platform introduction is often tied to the yearend holiday season and is not within our control if we miss this key selling period due to product delays or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have developed products our sales will suffer disproportionately our industry is also cyclical video game platforms have historically had a life cycle of four to six years as one group of platforms is reaching the end of its cycle and new platforms are emerging consumers often defer game software purchases until the new platforms are available causing sales to decline this decline may not be offset by increased sales of products for the new platform for example the market for products for sony’s older playstation game console has dropped faster than expected since the launch of the playstation 2 platform our business is intensely competitive and increasingly “hit” driven if we do not continue to deliver “hit” products our success will be limited   competition in our industry is intense and new products are regularly introduced during calendar year 2002 approximately 22 percent of the sales of videogames in north america consisted of only 20 “hit” products out of thousands published these “hit” titles are increasingly expensive to produce if our competitors develop more successful products or if we do not continue to develop consistently highquality products our revenue will decline 55 if we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to intellectual property we will publish fewer hit titles and our revenue will decline   many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our ea sports products include intellectual property licenses from the major sports leagues and players associations similarly many of our hit ea games titles such as james bond harry potter and lord of the rings are based on key film and literary licenses competition for these licenses is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses and obtain additional licenses with significant commercial value we will be unable to increase our revenue in the future if patent claims continue to be asserted against us we may be unable to sustain our current business models or profits   many patents have been issued that may apply to widely used game technologies additionally infringement claims under many recently issued patents are now being asserted against internet implementations of existing games several such claims have been asserted against us such claims can harm our business we incur substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims regardless of the merits of the claims in the event that there is a determination that we have infringed a thirdparty patent we could incur significant monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future other intellectual property claims may increase our product costs or require us to cease selling affected products   many of our products include extremely realistic graphical images and we expect that as technology continues to advance images will become even more realistic some of the images and other content are based on realworld examples that may inadvertently infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement from time to time we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims existing or future infringement claims against us whether valid or not may be time consuming and expensive to defend such claims or litigations could require us to stop selling the affected products redesign those products to avoid infringement or obtain a license all of which would be costly and harm our business our business our products and our distribution are subject to increasing regulation in key territories of content consumer privacy and online delivery if we do not successfully respond to these regulations our business may suffer   legislation is continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution for example privacy laws in the united states and europe impose various restrictions on our web sites those rules vary by territory although the internet recognizes no geographical boundaries other countries such as germany have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged goods and those transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current united states laws in the united states the federal and several state governments are considering content restrictions on products such as ours as well as restrictions on distribution of such products any one or more of these factors could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers and by requiring additional differentiation between products for different territories to address varying regulations this additional product differentiation would be costly if we do not consistently meet our product development schedules we will experience fluctuations in our operating results   product development schedules particularly for new hardware platforms highend multimedia pcs and the internet are difficult to predict because they involve creative processes use of new development tools for new platforms and the learning process research and experimentation associated with 56 development for new technologies we have in the past experienced development delays for several of our products failure to meet anticipated production or “go live” schedules may cause a shortfall in our revenue and profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different from expectations delays that prevent release of our products during peak selling seasons may reduce lifetime sales of those products 

  technology changes rapidly in our business and if we fail to anticipate new technologies the quality timeliness and competitiveness of our products will suffer   rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate sometimes years in advance which technologies our products must take advantage of in order to make them competitive in the market at the time they are released therefore we usually start our product development with a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve we may not be able to achieve these goals or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly than we can in either case our products may be technologically inferior to competitive products or less appealing to consumers or both if we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule of our products then we may delay products until these technology goals can be achieved which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses alternatively we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies either to preserve our product launch schedule or to keep up with our competition which would increase our development expenses if we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel we will be unable to effectively conduct our business   the market for technical creative marketing and other personnel essential to the development of our products and management of our businesses is extremely competitive in the last fiscal year notwithstanding the downturn of the economy generally competitive recruiting efforts aimed at our employees and executives continued for example in fiscal 2003 a team of employees that developed one of our hit medal of honor products left the company to develop products for a competitor our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of executives and key creative talent in addition the cost of real estate in the san francisco bay area – the location of our headquarters and one of our largest studios – remains high and has made recruiting from other areas and relocating employees to our headquarters more difficult if we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need our ability to develop and manage our businesses will be impaired our platform licensors are our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of andor access to our video game products if they do not approve our products we will be unable to ship to our customers   our agreements with hardware licensors such as sony for the playstation 2 microsoft for the xbox and nintendo for the gamecube who are also our chief competitors typically give significant control to the licensor over the approval and manufacturing of our products which could in certain circumstances leave us unable to get our products approved manufactured and shipped to customers in most events control of the approval and manufacturing process by the platform licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently while we believe that our relationships with our hardware licensors are currently good the potential for delay or refusal to approve or manufacture our products exists such occurrences would harm our business and our financial performance   in addition as online capabilities for videogame platforms emerge our platform licensors will control our ability to provide online game capabilities for our console platform products currently both microsoft and sony provide online capabilities for xbox and playstation 2 products respectively in each case compatibility code and the consent of the licensor are required for us to include online capabilities in our products in addition the business model for microsoft’s and sony’s online businesses for their videogame 57 products may compete with our online business as these capabilities become more significant the failure or refusal of our licensors to approve our products or the successful deployment by these licensors of services competitive to ours may harm our business 

our international revenues are subject to currency fluctuations   for the year ended march 31 2003 international net revenue comprised 42 percent of total consolidated net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2002 international net revenue comprised 37 percent of total consolidated net revenue we expect foreign sales to continue to account for a significant and growing portion of our revenue such sales are subject to unexpected regulatory requirements tariffs and other barriers additionally foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies which may fluctuate against the dollar while we hedge against foreign currency fluctuations we cannot control translation issues our reported financial results could be affected if significant changes in current accounting principles are adopted   recent actions and public comments from the sec have focused on the integrity of financial reporting generally similarly congress has considered a variety of bills that could affect certain accounting principles the fasb and other regulatory accounting agencies have recently introduced several new or proposed accounting standards such as accounting for stock options some of which represent a significant change from current practices changes in our accounting for stock options could materially increase our reported expenses our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly   as a result of the factors discussed in this report and other factors that may arise in the future the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us to changes in analysts’ earnings estimates or to factors affecting the computer software internet entertainment media or electronics businesses 58 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks including the changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and prices foreign exchange contracts used to hedge foreign currency exposures and shortterm investments are subject to market risk we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be subject to interest rate risk due to their short maturities we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes foreign currency exchange rate risk we utilize foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures of underlying assets and liabilities primarily certain intercompany receivables that are denominated in foreign currencies thereby limiting our risk our foreign exchange contracts are accounted for as derivatives whereby the gains and losses on these contracts are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations gains and losses on open contracts at the end of each accounting period resulting from changes in the forward rate are recognized in earnings and are designed to offset gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities at march 31 2003 we had foreign exchange contracts all with maturities of less than one month to purchase and sell approximately 1555 million in foreign currencies primarily british pounds swedish krona european currency units “euro” and other currencies fair value represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate and the forward rate the counterparties to these contracts are substantial and creditworthy multinational commercial banks the risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are not considered to be material notwithstanding our efforts to manage foreign exchange risks there can be no assurances that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations the following table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts at march 31 2003 the information is provided in us dollar equivalents and presents the notional amount forward amount the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and fair value  59 while the contract amounts provide one measurement of the volume of these transactions they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk the amounts arising from the possible inabilities of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterparties’ obligations exceed our obligations as these contracts can be settled on a net basis at our option we control credit risk through credit approvals limits and monitoring procedures interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short average maturities we also manage our interest rate risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that we are typically able to hold our investments to maturity at march 31 2003 our cash equivalents and shortterm investments included debt securities of 12702 million notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations the table below presents the amounts and related weighted average interest rates of our investment portfolio at march 31 2003     60

market

          historically no hardware platform or video game system has achieved
longterm dominance in the interactive entertainment market in addition the
installed base of multimediaenabled home computers including those with
internet accessibility has continued to grow as personal computer or pc
prices have declined and the quality and choices of software have increased
dramatically we develop and publish products for multiple platforms and this
diversification continues to be a cornerstone of our strategy

console is a 128bit digital versatile disk dvd based system that is
internet and cable ready as well as backward compatible with the current
playstation console software we currently have various products under
development for the sony playstation 2 console see risk factors  new video

128bit dvd based system we currently have various products under development
for the microsoft xbox

          new entrants
          new entrants into the interactive entertainment and multimedia
industries such as cable television telephone and diversified media and
entertainment companies in addition to a proliferation of new technologies
such as online networks and the internet have increased the competition in our
markets our new product releases in fiscal 2003 will be primarily for the
playstation 2 pc nintendo gamecube and xbox we are also scheduled to release
two online network gaming products during fiscal 2003 see risk factors  new
video game platforms create additional technical and business model
uncertainties and the impact of ecommerce and online games on our business is
not known

          the early investment in products for the 32bit market including both
compact disk personal computer or pc and dedicated entertainment systems that
we call video game systems or consoles has been strategically important in
positioning us for the current generation of 128bit machines we believe that
such investment continues to be important during the fiscal years 2002 and
2001 the video and computer games industry has experienced a platform
transition from 32bit cdbased and 64bit cartridgebased consoles to the
current generation 128bit dvdbased game consoles and related software the
transition to the current generation systems was initiated by the launch of
sonys playstation 2 in fiscal 2001 and continued with the launches of the
nintendo gamecube and microsofts xbox in calendar year 2001 as the market
continues to shift to the current generation systems sales of 32bit and 64bit
products have been declining and we expect a continued significant decline in
fiscal 2003 in addition our revenues and earnings are dependent on our ability
to meet our product release schedule and our failure to meet those schedules
could result in revenues and earnings which fall short of analysts expectations
in any individual quarter see risk factors  product development schedules are
frequently unreliable and make predicting quarterly results difficult

          online games
          according to march 2002 media metrix results eacom continues to
retain its position as the 1 gamesite in terms of unique monthly visitors with
over 133 million unique visitors for the month of march across all public and
aol properties in addition eacom comprised approximately 42 of all time
spent on internet gamesites in march totaling 46 billion minutes we believe
the online gaming market will continue to grow due to the following factors

         increasing popularity of pc gaming
         growing interest in multiplayer games
         growth in the number of households with pcs and internet connections
         general growth in internet usage including the number of users
          communities and increased frequency of use by consumers
         rapid innovation of new online entertainment experiences
         mass market adoption of broadband technologies and
         future introduction of online gaming capabilities for nextgeneration
          consoles

competition

          ea core
          see risk factors  our platform licensors are our chief competitors
and frequently control the manufacturing of our video game products

          eacom

we believe eacom faces substantial competition from a number of existing and
potential competitors including

         console  pc game publishers other game publishers including sony
          computer entertainment of america sony nintendo sega

          develop games with online capabilities for the nintendo gamecube
          playstation 2 and xbox consoles each of these companies may compete
          with eacom for advertising subscription and ecommerce sales
         portals with respect to advertising and ecommerce sales eacom will
          also compete with general purpose consumer web sites such as yahoo
          lycos and microsoft network in addition many of these internet
          portals offer gaming sites such as yahoo games channel lycos
          gamesville and microsoft gaming zone although most of the game areas
          of these portals have attained modest reach their key placement on
          powerful portals makes them potentially significant competitors for
          gaming subscriptions as well
         family oriented game sites a number of sites such as stationcom
          uproarcom and iwincom have driven significant amounts of traffic to
          their sites by offering unique games and entertainment content in
          addition several of the sites offer frequent prizes with easy to play
          gamettes these sites are typically monetizing their traffic by
          selling advertising
         aggregators aggregators such as microsoft gaming zone provide an
          aggregation of various types of online games including aggregation of
          games developed by independent third parties while these sites have
          been primarily focused on serving the gaming community they have
          since adjusted their strategy to include games such as parlor games
          that reach a broader audience
         sports sites sports content sites such as espncom sportslinecom
          and foxsportscom typically feature fantasy league games and easy to
          play sports gamettes in addition to their editorial content such
          fantasy league games and sports gamettes typically appeal to the
          overall sports fan rather than the sports gamer however these sites
          have significant financial and content resources at their disposal and
          will provide competition for advertising and ecommerce sales
         microsoft gaming zone mgz microsoft falls into a number of the
          foregoing categories as it is a portal an aggregator and a
          publisher of pc software products including game products as such
          microsofts offerings are the closest parallel to the proposed
          offerings of eacom mgz currently offers both family games and games
          directed towards the more serious gamer and at the same time has the
          opportunity to leverage these experiences with games sold at retail

relationships with significant hardware platform companies

          sony

          in fiscal 2002 approximately 28 of our net revenues were derived
from sales of software for the playstation 2 compared to 20 in fiscal 2001 we
released 18 titles worldwide in fiscal 2002 for the playstation 2 compared to 15
titles in fiscal 2001 key releases for the year included madden nfltm 2002
james bond 007 inagent under firetm fifa 2002 nba street nba live 2002
ncaa football 2002 ssx tricky nhl 2002 and nascar thunder 2002 revenues
increased for fiscal 2002 due to the higher installed base of playstation 2
hardware and more titles including catalogue available on the platform
compared to the prior year we expect revenues from playstation 2 products to
continue to grow in fiscal 2003 but as revenues for these products increase we
do not expect to maintain these growth rates

          in fiscal 2002 approximately 11 of our net revenues were derived
from sales of software for the playstation compared to 23 in fiscal 2001
during fiscal 2002 we released five playstation games compared to 17 in fiscal
2001 as expected playstation sales decreased for fiscal 2002 compared to the
prior year primarily attributable to releasing fewer games and to the
playstation 2 platform transition most of our franchises experienced
significant decreases from prior year releases although our playstation
products are playable on the playstation 2 console we expect sales of current
playstation products to continue to decline significantly in fiscal 2003 see
risk factors  product development schedules are frequently unreliable and make
predicting quarterly results difficult

          under the terms of a licensing agreement entered into with sony
computer entertainment of america in july 1994 the sony agreement as
amended we are authorized to develop and distribute cdbased software products
compatible with the playstation furthermore under the terms of an additional
licensing agreement entered into with sony computer entertainment of america as
of april 2000 the playstation 2 agreement as amended we are authorized to
develop and distribute dvdbased software products compatible with the
playstation 2 pursuant to these agreements we engage sony to manufacture its
playstation and playstation 2 cds and dvds for us accordingly we have limited
ability to control our supply of playstation and playstation 2 cd and dvd
products or the timing of their delivery see risk factors  our platform
licensors are our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of
our video game products

madden nfl 2002 james bond 007 inagent under fire ssx tricky nba street
and fifa soccer 2002 following the platforms launch in japan in september 2001
and in north america in november 2001

          during fiscal 2002 we released one title for the nintendo 64
n64r compared to three titles in fiscal 2001 in fiscal 2002
approximately 1 of our net revenues were derived from the sale of n64 products
compared to 5 in 2001 the expected decrease in n64 revenues for the fiscal
year compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to fewer releases
the decrease was also due to the weaker market for n64 products in the current
year we do not intend to release any new n64 products in fiscal 2003

          microsoft

          during fiscal 2002 following the launch of the xbox platform in north
america in november 2001 in japan in february 2002 and in europe in march 2002

products and product development

          in fiscal 2002 we generated approximately 61 of our revenues from ea
studio products released during the year see risk factors  product
development schedules are frequently unreliable and make predicting quarterly
results difficult as of march 31 2002 we were actively marketing
approximately 90 titles comprising over 120 stock keeping units or skus that
were published by our development divisions and subsidiaries ea studios during
fiscal 2002 we introduced 32 ea studios titles representing 64 skus compared
to 35 ea studios titles comprising 55 skus in fiscal 2001 in fiscal 2002 we
had 16 titles that sold over one million units in both fiscal 2001 and 2000 we
had 14 titles that sold over one million units

          the products published by ea studios are designed and created by our
inhouse designers and artists and by independent software developers
independent artists we typically pay the independent artists royalties
based on the sales of the specific products as defined in the related
independent artist agreements

          for fiscal 2002 we had one title harry potter and the sorcerers
stonetm published on four different platforms which represented
approximately 12 of our total fiscal 2002 net revenues for fiscal 2001 and
2000 no title represented revenues greater than 10 of our total fiscal 2001
and 2000 net revenues

          we publish products in a number of categories such as sports action
strategy simulations role playing and adventure each of which is becoming
increasingly competitive our sportsrelated products marketed under the ea
sportstm brand name accounted for a significant percentage of net revenues in
fiscal years 2002 2001 and 2000 there can be no assurance that we will be able
to maintain our market share in the sports category

          the front line retail selling prices in north america of our products
excluding older titles marketed as classics typically range from 3000 to
5500 classics titles have retail selling prices that range from 1000 to
3000 the retail selling prices of ea titles outside of north america vary
based on local market conditions

                                       8

          we currently develop or publish products for eight different hardware
platforms in fiscal 2002 our product releases were for playstation 2 pc
xbox playstation nintendo gamecube game boy advance game boy color online
internet play and n64 our planned product introductions for fiscal 2003 are for
the playstation 2 pc nintendo gamecube xbox playstation game boy advance
online internet play and game boy color see risk factors  product development
schedules are frequently unreliable and make predicting quarterly results
difficult and new video game platforms create additional technical and
business model uncertainties

          our goal is to be the market leader on the next generation of video
game consoles we are investing in the development of tools and technologies
associated with the introduction of the next generation video game console
platforms our goal is to be the leading provider of interactive entertainment
on the internet we will invest in the development of tools and technologies
associated with the introduction of key online offerings in fiscal 2003
playstation has achieved significant market acceptance in all geographic
territories however as the playstation console market has reached maturity we
expect sales of playstation products to continue to decline significantly in
fiscal 2003 most of the console video game products are convertible for use on
multiple advanced hardware systems we had research and development expenditures
of 3877 million in fiscal 2002 3889 million in fiscal 2001 and 2620
million in fiscal 2000 see risk factors  product development schedules are
frequently unreliable and make predicting quarterly results difficult

          eacom web site
          free content in fiscal 2002 eacom eliminated its free games

marketing and distribution

          electronic arts distribution
          we distribute ea studio affiliated label and copublished products

          we market our ea studio products using the ea gamestm ea sportstm
and ea sports bigtm brands ea games consists of our separate brands
including electronic arts and maxis ea sports brand simulates professional and
collegiate sports and includes titles such as madden nfl fifa and nba live ea
sports big brand simulates extreme sports such as the ssx and nba street games

          affiliated label products are delivered to us as completed products
copublished products are titles we have assisted in developing with other
software publishers as of march 31 2002 we distributed approximately 30
affiliated label and copublished titles in north america no single affiliated
label publisher has accounted for more than 10 of our net revenues in any of
the last three fiscal years

          in may 1998 electronic arts and square co ltd formed a new joint
venture in north america creating square electronic arts llc square ea as
discussed in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included
in item 8 hereof in conjunction with the formation of this joint venture we
have the exclusive right in north america to distribute products published by
this joint venture either party may terminate the existence of square ea and
the distribution agreement effective march 31 2003 in fiscal 2002 square ea
published final fantasyr x for the playstation 2 which was a top ten selling
title for electronic arts

          we generated approximately 95 of our north american net revenues from
direct sales to retailers through a field sales organization of professionals
and a group of telephone sales representatives the remaining 5 of our north
american sales were made through a limited number of specialized and regional
distributors and rack jobbers in markets where we believe direct sales would not
be economical we had sales to one customer walmart stores inc which
represented 14 of total net revenues in fiscal 2002 and 12 in both fiscal 2001
and 2000

          the video game and pc businesses have become increasingly hits
driven requiring significantly greater expenditures for marketing and
advertising particularly for television advertising there can be no assurance
that we will continue to produce hit titles or that advertising for any
product will increase sales sufficiently to recoup those advertising expenses

          we have stockbalancing programs for our personal computer products
that under certain circumstances and up to a specified amount allow for the
exchange of personal computer products by resellers we may decide to provide
price protection under certain circumstances for our personal computer and video
game system products after we analyze inventory remaining in the channel the
rate of inventory sell through in the channel and our remaining inventory on
hand we maintain a policy of exchanging products or giving credits but do not
give cash refunds moreover the risk of product returns for our products on
mature platforms may increase as new hardware platforms such as xbox nintendo
gamecube and playstation 2 become more popular we monitor and manage the
volume of our sales to retailers and distributors and their inventories as
substantial overstocking in the distribution channel can result in high returns
or the requirement for substantial price protection in subsequent periods we
believe that we provide adequate reserves for returns and price protection which
are based on estimated future returns of products taking into account
historical returns current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory
of our products current trends in the video game market and the overall
economy changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other
related factors we believe our current reserves will be sufficient to meet
return and price protection requirements for current inchannel inventory
however there can be no assurance that actual returns or price protection will
not exceed our reserves

          within the eacom site we offer visitors the opportunity to purchase
electronic arts software products directly from us we utilize ea cores
distribution network to fulfill consumers online orders we also have a
fulfillment group that sells product directly to consumers through a tollfree
number and through our websites listed in advertising by us and our affiliated
labels this group is also responsible for targeted direct mail marketing and
sells product backups and accessories to registered customers

          the distribution channels through which consumer software products are
sold have been characterized by change including consolidations and financial
difficulties of certain distributors the bankruptcy or other business
difficulties of a distributor or retailer could render our accounts receivable
from such entity uncollectible which could have an adverse effect on our
operating results and financial condition in january 2002 one of our retail
customers kmart declared bankruptcy we have adequately reserved for our
exposure to kmart in addition an increasing number of companies are competing
for access to these channels our arrangements with our distributors and
retailers may be terminated by either party at any time without cause
distributors and retailers often carry products that compete with ours
retailers of our products typically have a limited amount of shelf space and
promotional resources

                                       10

for which there is intense competition there can be no assurance that
distributors and retailers will continue to purchase our products or provide our
products with adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support

we operate in two principal business segments globally

         ea core business segment creation marketing and distribution of
          entertainment software

international operations

          we have wholly owned subsidiaries throughout the world including
offices in the united kingdom france spain germany australia canada south
africa singapore sweden japan malaysia brazil and holland the amounts of
net revenues operating profit and identifiable assets attributable to each of
our geographic regions for each of the last three fiscal years are set forth in
note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8
hereof

          international net revenues increased by 29 to 631431000 or 37 of
consolidated fiscal 2002 net revenues compared to 490349000 or 37 of
consolidated fiscal 2001 net revenues due to the following

    europes net revenues increased 34 primarily due to higher playstation 2
     al and pc sales partially offset by the expected decrease of revenues from
     sony playstation playstation 2 launched in november 2000 consequently
     fiscal 2001 includes five months of revenues as compared to twelve months
     of revenues from the playstation 2 in fiscal 2002 resulting in an 80
     increase in playstation 2 revenues in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal
     2001
    asia pacifics net revenues increased by 5 compared to the prior year
     primarily due to higher playstation 2 game boy colorr and pc revenue
     partially offset by the expected decrease in playstation and nintendo 64
     sales and an unfavorable exchange rate comparison of approximately 10
     playstation 2 revenues increased by 46 partially offset by a 34 decrease
     in playstation revenues in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001
    japans net revenues increased by 11 compared to the prior year primarily
     due to higher al revenue and revenue generated from sales of playstation
     nintendo gamecube and xbox products offset by the strong sales of our
     first playstation 2 title fifa soccer world championship in the prior
     year and weakness in the yen currency during fiscal 2002 resulting in a
     rate decrease of approximately 14 from fiscal 2001 also japan did not
     benefit from our primary playstation 2 releases during the current fiscal
     year which have more appeal to the north american market playstation 2
     revenues decreased by 50 in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001

          though international revenues are expected to grow in fiscal 2003
international revenues may not grow at as high a rate as in prior years see
risk factors  our business our products and our distribution are subject to
increasing regulation of content consumer privacy and online delivery in key
territories and foreign sales and currency fluctuations

manufacturing and suppliers

          materials
          in many instances we are able to acquire materials on a
volumediscount basis we have multiple potential sources of supply for most
materials except with respect to our playstation playstation 2 xbox and
nintendo gamecube products as previously mentioned we also have alternate
sources for the manufacture and assembly of most of our products to date we
have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in production of our
software and related documentation and packaging however a shortage of
components or other factors beyond our control could impair our ability to
manufacture or have manufactured our products see risk factors  our
platform licensors are our chief competitors and frequently control the
manufacturing of our video game products

backlog

          we normally ship products within a few days after receipt of an order
however a backlog may occur for ea studio and affiliated label products that
have been announced for release but not yet shipped we do not consider backlog
to be an indicator of future performance

seasonality

          our business is highly seasonal we typically experience our highest
revenues and profits in the calendar yearend holiday season and a seasonal low
in revenues and profits in the quarter ending in june see risk factors  our
business is both seasonal and cyclical

employees

          as of march 31 2002 we employed approximately 3500 people of whom
over 1400 were outside the united states of this amount there were over 400
eacom fulltime employees we believe that our ability to attract and retain
qualified employees is an important factor in our growth and development and
that our future success will depend in large measure on our ability to
continue to attract and retain qualified employees to date we have been
successful in recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified personnel
to conduct our business successfully see risk factors  because of the
competition for qualified technical creative marketing and other personnel we
may not be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for our
businesses

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations

the following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations contains forwardlooking statements about circumstances
that have not yet occurred all statements trend analysis and other information
contained below relating to markets our products and trends in revenue as well
as other statements including words such as anticipate believe or expect
and statements in the future tense are forwardlooking statements these
forwardlooking statements are subject to business and economic risks and actual
events or our actual future results could differ materially from those set forth
in the forwardlooking statements due to such risks and uncertainties we will
not necessarily update information if any forwardlooking statement later turns
out to be inaccurate risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results
and performance include but are not limited to those discussed under the
heading risk factors at pages 45 to 50 of this annual report on form 10k

critical accounting policies

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations discusses our consolidated financial statements which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
united states of america the preparation of these consolidated financial
statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period the
policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because
they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results
of operations and their application places the most significant demands on
managements judgment with financial reporting results relying on estimates
about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain specific risks for
these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs
for all of these policies management cautions that actual results may differ
materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

sales allowances and bad debt reserves
we derive revenues from sales of our packaged goods product subscriptions of
online service sales of packaged goods through our online store and website
advertising product revenue is recognized net of an allowance for returns we
also have stockbalancing programs for our personal computer products that
under certain circumstances and up to a specified amount allow for the exchange
of personal computer products by resellers we may decide to provide price
protection under certain circumstances for our personal computer and video game
system products after we analyze inventory remaining in the channel the rate
of inventory sell through in the channel and our remaining inventory on hand
we maintain a policy of exchanging products or giving credits but do not give
cash refunds

we estimate potential future product returns price protection and
stockbalancing programs related to current period product revenue we analyze
historical returns current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory
of our products current trends in the video game market and the overall
economy changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other
related factors when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and price
protection allowances in addition management monitors and manages the volume
of our sales to retailers and distributors and their inventories as substantial
overstocking in the distribution channel can result in high returns or the
requirement for substantial price protection in subsequent periods in the past
actual returns have not generally exceeded our reserves however actual returns
in any future period are inherently uncertain as unsold products in the
distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences
market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms product
updates or competing products for example the risk of product returns for our
products on mature platforms may increase as new hardware platforms such as
xbox nintendo gamecube and playstation 2 become more popular while management
believes it can make reliable estimates for these matters if we changed our
assumptions and estimates our returns reserves would change which would impact
the net revenue we report in addition if actual returns were significantly
greater than the reserves we have established the actual results would decrease
our reported revenue conversely if actual returns were significantly less than
our reserves this would increase our reported revenue

similarly management must use significant judgment and make estimates in
connection with establishing allowances for doubtful accounts in any accounting
period management analyzes customer concentrations customer creditworthiness
and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for
doubtful accounts material differences may result in the amount and timing of
our bad debt expense for any period if management made different judgments or
utilized different estimates if our customers experience financial difficulties
and are not able to meet their ongoing financial obligations to us our results
of operations may be adversely impacted for example in january 2002 one of
our retail customers kmart declared bankruptcy we have adequately reserved
for our exposure to kmart our distribution channels have been characterized by
change including consolidations and financial difficulties of certain
distributors and retailers

                                       20

our gross accounts receivable balance was 306365000 and our allowance for
product returns pricing allowances and doubtful accounts was 115870000 as of
march 31 2002 as of march 31 2001 our gross accounts receivable balance was
264282000 and our allowance for product returns pricing allowances and
doubtful accounts was 89833000

prepaid royalties
prepaid royalties consist primarily of prepayments for manufacturing royalties
copublishing andor distribution affiliates and license fees paid to
celebrities professional sports organizations and other organizations for use
of their trade name and content also included in prepaid royalties are
prepayments made to independent software developers under development
arrangements that have alternative future uses prepaid royalties are expensed
at the contractual or effective royalty rate as cost of goods sold based on
actual net product sales we evaluate the future realization of prepaid
royalties quarterly and charge to research and development expense any amounts
that we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales we rely on
forecasted revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties if
actual revenues or revised forecasted sales fall below the initial forecasted
sales the charge to research and development expense may be larger than
anticipated in any given quarter once the charge has been taken to research and
development expense that amount will not be expensed in future quarters when
the product has shipped the current portion of prepaid royalties included in
other current assets was 65484000 at march 31 2002 and 46264000 at march
31 2001 the longterm portion of prepaid royalties included in other assets
was 1164000 at march 31 2002 and 9664000 at march 31 2001

valuation of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets
under current accounting standards we make judgments about the remaining useful
lives of goodwill purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an other than temporary
impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet
in order to judge the remaining useful life of an asset management makes
various assumptions about the value of the asset in the future this may include
assumptions about future prospects for the business that the asset relates to
and typically involves computations of the estimated future cash flows to be
generated by these businesses please refer to the operations by segment
discussion of the managements discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations for discussions of ea core and eacom for our ea core
division our future net cash flows are primarily dependent on the sale of
products for play on proprietary video game platforms the success of our
products is affected by the ability to accurately predict which platforms and
which products we develop will be successful also our revenues and earnings
are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules for our
eacom division the future net cash flows are dependent on the success of
online games offering games solely for online play is a substantial departure
from our traditional business of selling packaged software games because of our
inexperience in predicting usage patterns for our games we may not be effective
in achieving success that may otherwise be attainable from offering our games
online due to these and other factors described in our risk factors we may not
realize the future net cash flows necessary to recover our longlived assets
for example our product majestictm and our platinum offering which contained
certain browserbased entertainment games were launched with a monthly
subscription pricing model and obtained only limited commercial success
accordingly we did not realize our projected cash flows and discontinued these
offerings as part of eacoms restructuring plan

based on these judgments and assumptions management determines whether we need
to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our
balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value judgments and assumptions
about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective
they can be affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to
significant negative industry or economic trends significant changes in the
manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business and
significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future
operating results although we believe the judgments and assumptions management
has made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate there is nonetheless
a high degree of uncertainty and judgment involved for example as part of a
restructuring plan to reduce eacoms workforce and consolidate facilities in
the fiscal year ended march 31 2002 we recorded impairment charges to write
down certain of eacoms depreciable assets and certain intangibles to their
estimated fair value and to write off certain assets which were abandoned the
impairment charges were based on managements projections regarding the assets
remaining useful lives and future values the eacom business is still in the
growing stages therefore evaluating its business and prospects is more
difficult than would be the case for a more mature business we continue to
encounter the risks and difficulties faced with launching a new business we
continue to look for ways to streamline the business by consolidating systems
and reducing infrastructure costs different judgments and assumptions could
materially impact our reported financial results more conservative assumptions
of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses would result in greater
impairment charges which would decrease net income and result in lower asset
values on our balance sheet conversely less conservative assumptions would
result in smaller impairment charges higher net income and higher asset values
impairment charges on longlived assets amounted to 12818000 for the fiscal
year ended march 31 2002 there were no impairment charges on longlived assets
for the years ended march 31 2001 and 2000

on april 1 2002 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 142
sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets which supersedes
accounting principles board opinion no 17 intangible assets as a result of
adopting this standard we will continue to amortize finitelived intangibles
but will no longer amortize certain other intangible assets most notably
goodwill

                                       21

and acquired workforce which had a net book value at march 31 2002 of
69050000 amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce totaled
approximately 13125000 for fiscal 2002 approximately 9182000 for fiscal
2001 and approximately 6411000 for fiscal 2000 based on intangible assets as
of march 31 2002 we estimate that amortization of finitelived intangibles
will total approximately 8700000 for fiscal 2003 following adoption of sfas
142 we will continue to evaluate whether any event has occurred which might
indicate that the carrying value of an intangible asset is not recoverable in
addition sfas 142 requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual
assessment for impairment by applying a fair valuebased test

income taxes
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are
required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we
operate this process involves estimating our current tax exposures in each
jurisdiction including the impact if any of additional taxes resulting from
tax examinations as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of
deferred tax assets to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely
based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction a
valuation allowance is established tax exposures can involve complex issues and
may require an extended period to resolve to determine the quarterly tax rate
we are required to estimate fullyear income and the related income tax expense
in each jurisdiction the estimated effective tax rate is adjusted for the tax
related to significant unusual items changes in the geographic mix or estimated
level of annual pretax income can effect the overall effective tax rate

comparison of fiscal 2002 to 2001

revenues
we derive revenues primarily from shipments of entertainment software which
includes ea studio products for dedicated entertainment systems that we call
video game systems or consoles such as playstation playstation 2 xbox and
nintendo gamecube and handheld systems such as game boy advance ea studio
personal computer products or pc copublishing products that are copublished
and distributed by us and affiliated label or al products that are published
by third parties and distributed by us we also derive revenues from licensing
of ea studio products and al products through hardware companies or oem
selling subscriptions on our online gaming service selling advertisements on
our online web pages and selling our packaged goods through our online store

north america net revenues
the increase in north america net revenues for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal
2001 was primarily attributable to

    a 111 increase in playstation 2 revenues for the year due to the shipment
     of key titles such as madden nfl 2002 james bond 007 in agent under
     fire nba street nba live 2002 and ssx tricky a higher installed base of
     hardware and a strong catalogue business playstation 2 launched in
     october 2000 consequently fiscal 2001 includes six months of revenues as
     compared to twelve months of revenues for the playstation 2 in fiscal
     2002
    the launch of the xbox platform in north america in november 2001 which
     generated 73609000 in revenues from titles such as madden nfl 2002 nba
     live 2002 james bond 007 inagent under fire nascar thunder 2002 nhl
     2002 and ssx tricky
    the launch of nintendo gamecube in north america in november 2001 which
     generated 48744000 for the year from key titles such as madden nfl
     2002 james bond 007 inagent under fire ssx tricky nba street and fifa
     soccer 2002

    new revenues were generated by game boy advance of 25989000 for the year
     from key titles including harry potter and the sorcerers stone madden nfl
     and nhl 2002 also game boy color generated new revenues of 16870000
     for the year from titles such as harry potter and the sorcerers stone
     madden nfl 2002 and the world is not enough
    advertising revenues increased by 31849000 for the twelve months ended
     march 31 2002 as we commenced generating advertising revenues immediately
     following the launch of our gamesite on the world wide web in october 2000
     in addition advertising revenues were generated from pogo corporations
     pogo websites subsequent to the february 2001 acquisition
    these increases were partially offset by the continued expected decreases
     in sony playstation and nintendo 64 n64 revenues due to those declining
     markets and fewer titles shipping compared to the same period in the prior
     year

international net revenues
the increase in international net revenues for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal
2001 was attributable to the following

    europes net revenues increased by 34 compared to the prior year primarily
     due to higher playstation 2 al and pc sales partially offset by the
     expected decrease of revenues from sony playstation playstation 2 launched
     in november 2000 consequently fiscal 2001 includes five months of
     revenues as compared to twelve months of revenues from the playstation 2 in
     fiscal 2002 resulting in an 80 increase in playstation 2 revenues
    asia pacifics net revenues increased by 5 compared to the prior year
     primarily due to higher playstation 2 game boy color and pc revenue
     partially offset by the expected decrease in playstation and nintendo 64
     sales and an unfavorable exchange rate comparison of approximately 10
     playstation 2 revenues increased by 46 partially offset by a 34 decrease
     in playstation revenues in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001
    japans net revenues increased by 11 compared to the prior year primarily
     due to higher al revenue and revenue generated from sales of playstation
     nintendo gamecube and xbox products offset by the strong sales of our
     first playstation 2 title fifa soccer world championship in the prior
     year and weakness in the yen currency during fiscal 2002 resulting in a
     rate decrease of approximately 14 from fiscal 2001 also japan did not
     benefit from our primary playstation 2 releases during the current fiscal
     year which have more appeal to the north american market playstation 2
     revenues decreased by 50 in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001

and fewer titles released for the product during the current year

although our playstation products are playable on the playstation 2 console we
expect sales of current playstation products to continue to decline
significantly in fiscal 2003

under the terms of a licensing agreement entered into with sony computer
entertainment of america in july 1994 the sony agreement as amended we are
authorized to develop and distribute cdbased software products compatible with
the playstation furthermore under the terms of an additional licensing
agreement entered into with sony computer entertainment of america as of april
2000 the playstation 2 agreement as amended we are authorized to develop
and distribute dvdbased software products compatible with the playstation 2
pursuant to these agreements we engage sony to manufacture its playstation and
playstation 2 cds and dvds for us accordingly we have limited ability to
control our supply of playstation and playstation 2 cd and dvd products or the
timing of their delivery

advertising revenues
we commenced generating advertising revenues in the third quarter of fiscal year
2001 following the launch of our gamesite on the world wide web and the aol
games channel in october 2000 in addition we generated advertising revenue
from pogos websites subsequent to the purchase of pogo in february 2001 as a
result of establishing our ad business in late fiscal 2001 we experienced
significant revenue growth in fiscal 2002 due to this and continuing
uncertainties in the ad market we will not be able to sustain the same annual
growth rate as experienced in fiscal 2002

online subscription net revenues
the increase in online revenues for fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was
primarily attributable to the following

    an increase in the number of paying customers for ultima online to 207000
     as of march 31 2002 as compared to 203000 as of march 31 2001 this
     increase was primarily due to the continued strong sales of ultima online
     third dawn and the release of ultima online lord blackthorns revenge in
     february 2002 in addition the launch of motor city online in october
     2001 which contributed 1500000 in subscription revenues for fiscal
     2002

                                       24

   offset by a decrease in subscription revenues of 5000000 for gamestorm
    kesmai corporation kesmai and worldplay online games most of which were
    transferred to our free service when the eaaol site went live in october
    2000 in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001

license oem and other revenues
the increase in license oem and other revenues for the twelve months ended
march 31 2002 was primarily due to a new oem agreement with a customer in
europe and higher revenues in north america

nintendo 64 product net revenues
we released one n64 title in fiscal 2002 compared to three titles during fiscal
2001 the expected decrease in n64 revenues for the fiscal year compared to the
prior fiscal year was primarily due to the declining market for n64 products
and fewer titles released on this platform in the current fiscal year we do not
intend to release any new n64 products in fiscal 2003

online packaged goods net revenues
online packaged goods revenues for fiscal 2002 were slightly higher than fiscal
2001 primarily due to the release of motor city online in october 2001

affiliated label product net revenues
al product sales increased for fiscal 2002 compared to the prior fiscal year
primarily due to strong sales of hit titles including devil may cry and resident
evil code veronica resulting from new distribution deals with capcom as well as
the simpsonstm road rage in the current year this was partially offset by
lower revenues from shipment of square ea products due to fewer titles released
in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001

the following table shows our pro forma results reconciled to the generally
accepted accounting principles gaap consolidated statements of operations
our pro forma results do not include unusual events or transactions such as
restructuring and asset impairment costs and charge for acquired inprocess
technology and also excludes amortization of intangibles and noncash stock
compensation charges in addition income taxes are allocated to ea core and
eacom at the consolidated effective tax rate 31 on a pro rata basis we
believe the disclosure of the pro forma net income loss and operating profit
loss which excludes the items noted in the table below helps investors more
meaningfully evaluate the results of our ongoing operations however we urge
investors to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of
this annual report on form 10k and compare gaap financial information with the

research and development expenses excluding network development and support and
customer relationship management research and development expenses excluding
network development and support and customer relationship management decreased

  headcount reductions in eacom in october 2001 see charge for restructuring

  replacement of eacoms free games channel with pogo free games
  offset by increased payroll costs due to higher headcount in ea studios net
   of codevelopment arrangements
  offset by increased spending on eacom online projects in development
   primarily the sims online and earth  beyondtm

we expect research and development spending to increase in fiscal 2003 due to an
increase in development spending for next generation console products including
the playstation 2 xbox and nintendo gamecube as well as extending our
investment in the pc platform

network development and support network development and support expenses
increased in absolute dollars by 148 for fiscal 2002 primarily due to

  increased depreciation related to both hardware and internally developed
   software that began when the site went live in october 2000
  increased headcount and networkrelated costs associated with pogo
  partially offset by reduced consultant costs related to project and site
   enhancements
the expense run rate has been reduced as a result of the restructuring we do
not expect expenses to increase in fiscal 2003

customer relationship management customer relationship management expenses
decreased in absolute dollars by 67 for fiscal 2002 primarily due to headcount
reductions in eacom that occurred in october 2001 as part of the restructuring

the amortization of intangibles results primarily from the acquisitions of
westwood kesmai dreamworks interactive abc software pogo and other
acquisitions amortization of intangibles was 12888000 for ea core and
12530000 for eacom for fiscal 2002 amortization of intangibles was
12829000 for ea core and 6494000 for eacom for fiscal 2001 the increase
in fiscal year 2002 for eacom compared to the prior year was due to the
acquisition of pogo in february 2001

with the implementation of new accounting pronouncements see impact of recently
issued accounting standards on page 43 as of april 2002 we will continue to
amortize finitelived intangibles but will no longer amortize goodwill and
acquired workforce amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce totaled
approximately 13125000 for fiscal 2002 and approximately 9182000 for
fiscal 2001 based on intangible assets as of march 31 2002 we estimate that
amortization of finitelived intangibles will total approximately 8700000 for
fiscal 2003 following adoption of sfas 142 we will continue to evaluate
whether any event has occurred which might indicate that the carrying value of
an intangible asset is not recoverable in addition sfas 142 requires that
goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying
a fair valuebased test we are in the process of completing an evaluation for
impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas 142 we believe the
implementation of sfas 142 will not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements

in connection with the acquisition of pogo in the fourth fiscal quarter of
fiscal 2001 we allocated and expensed 2719000 of the 43333000 purchase
price to acquired inprocess technology at the date of acquisition this amount
was expensed as a nonrecurring charge as the inprocess technology had not yet
reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses pogo had
various projects in progress at the time of the acquisition as of the
acquisition date costs to complete pogo projects acquired were expected to be
approximately 1200000 in future periods during fiscal 2002 all of these
development projects were completed and launched on pogo gamesites in
conjunction with the acquisition of pogo we accrued approximately 100000
related to direct transaction and other related costs

this charge was made after we concluded that the inprocess technology had not
reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use after taking
into consideration the potential for usage of the software in different products
and resale of the software

during fiscal 2002 we announced a restructuring plan for eacom to reduce its
workforce and consolidate facilities these restructuring and resulting asset
impairment charges were necessary in order to focus on key online priorities and
reduce eacoms operating cost structure a pretax charge of 20303000 was
recorded in fiscal 2002 consisting of 4173000 for workforce reductions
3312000 for consolidation of facilities and other administrative charges and
12818000 for the writeoff of noncurrent assets as a direct result of the
restructuring the pretax charge of 20303000 consisted of 6836000 in cash
outlays and 13467000 in noncash charges related to the writeoffs of
noncurrent assets and facilities as of march 31 2002 an aggregate of
4016000 in cash had been paid out under the restructuring plan of the
remaining cash outlay of 2820000 1590000 is expected to occur in fiscal
2003 while the remaining 1230000 related to future lease payments will occur
is fiscal years 2004 and beyond adjustments to the restructuring reserves will
be made in future periods if necessary based upon current events and
circumstances

the restructuring plan resulted in the termination of approximately 270
personnel or one third of eacoms workforce which affected all departments
across the organization the estimated costs for consolidation of facilities are
comprised of contractual rental commitments under real estate leases for
unutilized office space offset by estimated future sublease income included in
these costs

                                       31

are estimated costs to close offices or consolidate facilities in various
locations and costs to write off a portion of the assets from these facilities

in addition the restructuring efforts required an evaluation of asset
impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no
121 sfas 121 accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for
longlived assets to be disposed of to adjust these depreciable assets and
certain intangibles to their estimated fair value management evaluated the
impact of consolidating or abandoning certain eacom technologies and processes
and reviewed the effect of changes to eacoms subscription product offerings in
relation to eacoms asset base impairment charges on longlived assets
amounted to 12818000 and included 11177000 relating to consolidated or
abandoned technologies for the eacom infrastructure and 1641000 of goodwill
and intangibles impairment charges relating to the eacoms san diego and kesmai
studios there are no assurances that the impairment factors evaluated by
management will not change in subsequent periods and accordingly this could
result in additional impairment charges in future periods

we will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of products departments
technology and processes and look for ways to consolidate and streamline eacom
operations in an effort to further reduce operating expenses

interest and other income net decreased in absolute dollars by 239 primarily
due to lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates in the current
year and an increase in the cost of utilizing foreign exchange hedge contracts

our effective tax rate was 310 for fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 at march 31
2002 we generated a federal income tax net operating loss this loss will be
carried forward to future tax years at march 31 2001 we also generated a
federal income tax net operating loss a substantial portion of this loss was
utilized in a carryback claim with the remainder being carried forward the net
operating losses for both fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 resulted from losses from
eacoms operations as well as stock option deductions a valuation allowance
has not been established on these loss carryforwards or other net deferred tax
assets as we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future
operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize them

in absolute dollars reported net income loss increased in fiscal 2002
primarily related to higher net revenues partially offset by higher expenses
compared to the same period last year the increase in expenses was primarily
due to increases in marketing and advertising costs to support a higher number
of franchise titles in addition higher expenses were due to the charge for
restructuring and impairment in fiscal 2002

we believe the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and operating profit
loss which does not include unusual events or transactions such as
restructuring and asset impairment costs and charge for acquired inprocess
technology and also excludes amortization of intangibles and noncash stock
compensation charges helps investors more meaningfully evaluate the results of
our ongoing operations however we urge investors to carefully review the gaap
financial information included as part of this annual report on form 10k and
compare gaap financial information with the pro forma financial results
disclosed in this annual report on form 10k

pro forma net income excluding the items noted above was 135195000 for the
fiscal year ended march 31 2002 and 5995000 for the fiscal year ended march
31 2001 the increase in pro forma net income for the fiscal year ended march
31 2002 was due to higher revenues and gross profits as compared to the same
periods last year this was partially offset by an increase in marketing and
sales expenses to support programs for key titles shipped in the current year

with the implementation of new accounting pronouncements relating to goodwill
and intangible assets see impact of recently issued accounting standards on
page 43 as of april 2002 we will continue to amortize finitelived
intangibles but will no longer amortize goodwill and acquired workforce
amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce totaled approximately
13125000 for fiscal 2002 and approximately 9182000 for fiscal 2001 based
on intangible assets as of march 31 2002 we estimate that amortization of
finitelived intangibles will total approximately 8700000 for fiscal 2003
following adoption of sfas 142 we will continue to evaluate whether any event
has occurred which might indicate that the carrying value of an intangible asset
is not recoverable in addition sfas 142 requires that goodwill be subject to
at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair valuebased
test we are in the process of completing an evaluation for impairment of
goodwill in accordance with sfas 142 we believe the implementation of sfas 142
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

north america net revenues
the decrease in north america net revenues for fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal
2000 was primarily attributable to

   expected declines in sales of playstation and n64 titles due to the
    beginning of the transition to next generation consoles playstation net
    revenues decreased 49 and n64 net revenues decreased 46 also due to fewer
    titles shipping in fiscal 2001 for both platforms
   a 6 decrease in al revenues primarily due to the acquisition of an
    affiliate dreamworks interactive by us in the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2000
   offset partially by the launch of playstation 2 platform in north america
    which generated 171034000 in revenue for fiscal 2001 from titles such as
    madden nfl 2001 ssx nba live 2001 and nhl 2001 playstation 2 revenues in
    fiscal 2001 did not offset the decrease in playstation revenues due to a
    reduced number of hardware units reaching the market due to hardware
    component shortages according to sony
   offset by a 21 increase in pc revenues due to the shipment of key releases
    including command  conquer red alerttm 2 and the sims livin large and
    continued strong catalog sales of the sims in fiscal 2001

international net revenues
the decrease in international net revenues for fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal
2000 was attributable to the following

   europes net revenues decreased 21 primarily due to the console transition
    lower al sales due to product release slips and fewer hit titles released in
    fiscal 2001 lower pc sales with fewer titles shipping in fiscal 2001 the
    strong sales of command  conquer tiberian suntm for the pc in fiscal
    2000 and weakness in the euro currency in addition playstation revenues
    decreased 43 due to fewer titles shipping during the console transition
    period in fiscal 2001 with most franchise titles showing significant
    decreases from fiscal 2000 releases playstation 2 revenues did not offset
    the decrease in playstation revenues due to fewer hardware units reaching
    the market and the weighting of titles specifically appropriate for the
    north american market rather than the european market
   asia pacifics net revenues decreased 4 mainly due to the decrease in
    playstation revenues as there were no significant new titles released in
    fiscal 2001 this was offset by sales of playstation 2 titles such as ssx
    and fifa 2001
   offset by japans net revenues which increased 58 compared to fiscal 2000
    primarily due to the shipment of playstation 2 titles such as fifa soccer
    world championship fifa 2001 and ssx in fiscal 2001

personal computer product net revenues
the increase in sales of pc products for fiscal 2001 was primarily attributable
to the continued strong sales of the sims which shipped in fiscal 2000 key
fiscal 2001 releases were command  conquer red alert 2 and the sims livin
large we released 20 pc titles in fiscal 2001 compared to 31 titles in fiscal
2000 the sims continued to be the number one pc title

playstation product net revenues
we released 17 playstation titles in fiscal 2001 compared to 30 in fiscal 2000
as expected playstation sales decreased for fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000
primarily attributable to the playstation 2 platform transition with the
exception of madden nfl all of our franchises experienced significant decreases
from fiscal 2000 releases

playstation 2 product net revenues
we released 15 titles worldwide in fiscal 2001 for the playstation 2 key
releases for fiscal 2001 included madden nfl 2001 ssx fifa 2001 nba live 2001
and nhl 2001 revenue was lower than expected due to the shortage of playstation
2 hardware in fiscal 2001 resulting from component shortages which limited the
number of units that could be manufactured according to sony

affiliated label product net revenues
the decrease in affiliated label net revenues for fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal
2000 was primarily due to the strong sales of final fantasyr viii in fiscal
2000 our acquisition of dreamworks interactive formerly an al in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2000 fewer hit al product releases and product release slips
in europe

n64 product net revenues
we released three n64 titles in fiscal 2001 compared to eight titles during
fiscal 2000 the expected decrease in n64 revenues for fiscal 2001 compared to
fiscal 2000 was primarily due to fewer releases the decrease was also due to
the weaker market for n64 products in fiscal 2001 the key release for fiscal
2001 was the world is not enough

online net revenues
the increase in online revenues for fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 was
attributable to the following

       the average number of paying customers for ultima online increased to
          approximately 200000 for fiscal 2001 as compared to over 140000 for
          fiscal 2000 this increase was due to continued strong sales of
          ultima online the addition of new events and parties within the
          ultima worlds and the release of ultima online renaissance in april
          2000
       we generated over 5100000 in subscription revenues for kesmai and
          worldplay online games for fiscal 2001 these products were not part
          of eacom in fiscal 2000 due to the kesmai acquisition in the fourth
          quarter of fiscal 2000

license oem and other revenues
the decrease in license oem and other revenues for fiscal 2001 as compared to
fiscal 2000 was primarily a result of lower license revenue of certain titles on
the game boy platform

the following table shows our pro forma results reconciled to the gaap
consolidated statements of operations our pro forma results do not include
unusual events or transactions such as restructuring and asset impairment costs
and charge for acquired inprocess technology and also excludes amortization of
intangibles and noncash stock compensation charges in addition income taxes
are allocated to ea core and eacom at the consolidated effective tax rate 31
on a pro rata basis we believe the disclosure of the pro forma net income
loss and operating profit loss which excludes the items noted in the table
below helps investors more meaningfully evaluate the results of our ongoing
operations however we urge investors to carefully review the gaap financial
information included as part of this annual report on form 10k and compare gaap
financial information with the pro forma financial results disclosed in this

marketing and sales expenses for fiscal 2001 increased as a percentage of
revenue primarily attributed to

    higher eacom marketing and sales expenses due to increased staff required
     to support the live game site and advertising campaigns run on the aol
     service promoting the games channel
    the amortization of the aol carriage fee which began with the launch of
     eacom in october 2000
    offset by lower television and print advertising in north america and

attributed to

    the expansion of the eacom staff and additional administrativerelated
     costs required to support the growth of the eacom business
    increase in bad debts due to a write off of a receivable as a result of the
     default of payment from a customer in europe for approximately 1000000

research and development excluding network development and support and customer
relationship management research and development expenses excluding network
development and support and customer relationship management increased in
absolute dollars by 354 for fiscal 2001 primarily attributed to

    increase in research and development expenses by eacom including expenses
     incurred by ea core on behalf of eacom due to an increase in the number
     of online projects in development and increased development staff to
     support these products
    an increase in development spending for next generation console products
     including development for the playstation 2 console xbox and nintendo
     gamecube
    the increase is also due to research and development expenses related to
     the acquisition of dreamworks interactive a software development company
     in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000

we released a total of 55 new packaged goods products in fiscal 2001 compared to
69 new products in fiscal 2000 in addition the eacom website launched in
october 2000 and had over 80 live games

network development and support the increase in network development and support
expenses was primarily due to increased spending for the network infrastructure
and the games channel on the aol service and the amortization of capitalized

fiscal 2001
in connection with the acquisition of pogo in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001
we allocated and expensed 2719000 of the 43333000 purchase price to
acquired inprocess technology at the date of acquisition this amount was
expensed as a nonrecurring charge as the inprocess technology had not yet
reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses pogo had
various projects in progress at the time of the acquisition as of the
acquisition date costs to complete pogo projects acquired were expected to be
approximately 1200000 in future periods during fiscal 2002 all of these
development projects were completed and launched on pogo gamesites in
conjunction with the acquisition of pogo we accrued approximately 100000
related to direct transaction and other related costs

fiscal 2000
    in connection with the acquisition of kesmai by eacom in the fourth
     quarter of fiscal 2000 we allocated and expensed 3869000 of the
     purchase price to acquired inprocess technology
    in connection with the acquisitions of two development companies by ea
     core made in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2000 we allocated
     and expensed 2670000 of the purchase price to acquired inprocess
     technology

these charges were made after we concluded that the inprocess technology had
not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use after
taking into consideration the potential for usage of the software in different
products and resale of the software

interest and other income net increased in absolute dollars primarily due to
higher interest income as a result of higher average cash balances and investing
in higher yielding taxable securities in fiscal 2001 those gains were partially
offset by realized gains on sales of marketable securities in fiscal 2000

portion of this loss was utilized in a carryback claim with the remainder being
carried forward a valuation allowance was not established on this loss
carryforward or other net deferred tax assets as we believed it was more likely
than not that the results of future operations would generate sufficient taxable
income to realize them

in absolute dollars reported net income loss decreased in fiscal 2001
primarily related to lower revenues as well as higher costs and expenses
compared to fiscal 2000 the decrease in revenues was primarily due to the
beginning of the transition period to next generation console systems the
increase in expenses was primarily due to increases in development of next
generation console products in the core business and the investment in eacom
including expenses to build network and online game products and to launch our
game sites in october 2000

cash equivalents shortterm investments marketable securities and cash
generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and investment
requirements on both a shortterm and longterm basis however our ability to
maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and
uncertainties including but not limited to those related to customer demand
and acceptance of titles on new platforms and new title versions on existing
platforms our ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due
successfully achieving our product release schedules and attaining our
forecasted sales objectives the impact of competition the economic conditions

          accounted for as capital contributions from electronic arts excess

          funding procedures will continue in the nearterm however electronic

impact of recently issued accounting standards

in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas 142
goodwill and other intangible assets which supersedes accounting principles
board opinion no 17 apb 17 intangible assets sfas 142 addresses the
accounting treatment for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired
individually or with a group of other assets upon their acquisition but not
acquired in a business combination this statement also addresses how goodwill
and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been
initially recognized in the financial statements with the adoption of sfas 142
goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life
rather goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment
by applying a fairvaluebased test also if the benefit of an intangible asset
is obtained through contractual or other legal rights or if the intangible
asset can be sold transferred licensed rented or exchanged an acquired
intangible asset should be separately recognized the terms of sfas 142 are
effective as of the beginning of the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning
after december 15 2001 certain provisions of sfas 142 shall be applied to
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets for which the acquisition date is
after june 30 2001 on april 1 2002 we adopted sfas 142 as a result of
adopting this standard we will continue to amortize finitelived intangibles
but will no longer amortize certain other intangible assets most notably
goodwill and acquired workforce which had a net book value at march 31 2002 of
69050000 amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce totaled
approximately 13125000 for fiscal 2002 approximately 9182000 for fiscal
2001 and approximately 6411000 for fiscal 2000 based on intangible assets as
of march 31 2002 we estimate that amortization of finitelived intangibles
will total approximately 8700000 for fiscal 2003 following adoption of sfas
142 we will continue to evaluate whether any event has occurred which might
indicate that the carrying value of an intangible asset is not recoverable in
addition sfas 142 requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual
assessment for impairment by applying a fair valuebased test we are in the
process of completing an evaluation for impairment of goodwill in accordance
with sfas 142 we believe the implementation of sfas 142 will not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements

in june 2001 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no
143 sfas 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 143
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible longlived assets and the associated asset retirement
costs this statement applies to legal obligations associated with the
retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction
development or normal use of the asset sfas 143 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after june 15 2002 we do not expect the adoption of sfas 143 to have
a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of
operations

in october 2001 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no
144 sfas 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived
assets which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment
or disposal of longlived assets sfas 144 supersedes sfas 121 accounting for
the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed
of and also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion
no 30 reporting the results of operationsreporting the effects of disposal
of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and infrequently
occurring events and transactions for the disposal of a segment of a business
sfas 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 and
interim periods within those fiscal years we are in the process of determining
the impact of this new accounting standard we believe the implementation of
sfas 144 will not have a material impact to our consolidated financial
statements

risk factors

     electronic arts business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which
may affect our future financial performance some of those important risks and
uncertainties which may cause our operating results to vary or which may
materially and adversely affect our operating results are as follows

                   risk factors relating to our core business

new video game platforms create additional technical and business model
uncertainties

     large portions of our revenues are derived from the sale of products for
play on proprietary video game platforms such as the sony playstation the
success of our products is significantly affected by acceptance of the new video
game hardware systems and the life span of older hardware platforms and our
ability to accurately predict which platforms will be most successful

     sometimes we will spend development and marketing resources on products
designed for new video game systems that have not yet achieved large installed
bases or will continue product development for older hardware platforms that may
have shorter life cycles than we expected conversely if we do not develop for
a platform that achieves significant market acceptance or discontinue
development for a platform that has a longer life cycle than expected our
revenue growth may be adversely affected

     for example the sega dreamcast console launched in japan in early 1999 and
in the united states in september of 1999 we have developed no products for
this platform had this platform achieved wide market acceptance our revenue
growth would have been adversely affected similarly we are developing products
for the xbox and nintendo gamecube if these platforms do not achieve wide
commercial acceptance our revenue growth will be adversely impacted

product development schedules are frequently unreliable and make predicting
quarterly results difficult

     product development schedules particularly for new hardware platforms and
highend multimedia personal computers or pcs are difficult to predict because
they involve creative processes use of new development tools for new platforms
and the learning process research and experimentation associated with
development for new technologies for example emperor battle for dune for the
pc which was expected to ship in fiscal 2001 was not released until the first
quarter of fiscal 2002 due to development delays also james bond 007
inagent under fire for the ps2 which was expected to ship in fiscal 2001
released in october of fiscal 2002 due to development delays additionally
development risks for cdrom and dvd products can cause particular difficulties
in predicting quarterly results because brief manufacturing lead times allow
finalizing products and projected release dates late in a quarter our revenues
and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules
and our failure to meet those schedules could result in revenues and earnings
which fall short of analysts expectations for any individual quarter and the
fiscal year

our business is both seasonal and cyclical

     our business is highly seasonal with a significant percentage of our
revenues occurring in the december quarter in fiscal 2002 these seasonal
trends were magnified by general industry factors including the platform
transition the fall 2001 launches of the xbox and nintendo gamecube in north
america and the economic slowdown in the united states and other territories
our business is also cyclical video game platforms have historically had a life
cycle of four to six years and decline as more advanced platforms are being
introduced as one group of platforms is reaching the end of its cycle and new
platforms are emerging buying patterns may change purchases of products for
older platforms may slow at a faster rate than sales of new platforms we have
been going through a platform transition during the last 18 months and are now
well into a new platform cycle sony shipped its playstation 2 console in japan
in march 2000 in north america in october 2000 and in europe in november 2000
nintendo launched the nintendo gamecube console in japan in september 2001
north america in november 2001 and in europe in may 2002 microsoft launched the
xbox console in north america in november 2001 in japan in february 2002 and in
europe in march 2002 sales of our products for the n64 and sony playstation
platforms have already been adversely affected and we expect this trend to
continue

the impact of ecommerce and online games on our business is not known

     while we do not currently derive significant revenues from online sales of
our packaged products we believe that such form of distribution will become a
more significant factor in our business in the future ecommerce is becoming an
increasingly popular method for conducting business with consumers how that
form of distribution will affect the more traditional retail distribution at

                                       45

which we have historically had success and over what time period is uncertain
in addition we expect the number and popularity of online games to increase and
become a significant factor in the interactive games business generally we do
not know how that increase generally or the emerging business of eacom
specifically will affect the sales of packaged goods

our business our products and our distribution are subject to increasing
regulation of content consumer privacy and online delivery in key territories

     legislation is increasingly introduced which may affect the content of our
products and their distribution for example privacy rules in the united states
and europe impose various restrictions on our web sites those rules vary by
territory while of course the internet recognizes no geographical boundaries
other countries such as germany have adopted laws regulating content transmitted
over the internet that are stricter than current united states laws in the
united states in response to recent events the federal and several state
governments are considering content restrictions on products such as those made
by us as well as restrictions on distribution of such products any one or more
of these factors could harm our business

our platform licensors are our chief competitors and frequently control the
manufacturing of our video game products

     our agreements with hardware licensors which are also our chief
competitors typically give significant control to the licensor over the
approval and manufacturing of our products this fact could in certain
circumstances leave us unable to get our products approved manufactured and
shipped to customers in most events control of the approval and manufacturing
process by the platform licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times
and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently for example in
prior years we experienced delays in obtaining approvals for and manufacturing
of playstation products which caused delays in shipping those products the
potential for additional delay or refusal to approve or manufacture our products
continues with our platform licensors such occurrences would harm our business
and adversely affect our financial performance additionally we have not
negotiated a final publishing agreement with nintendo for the nintendo gamecube
platform and although we are currently operating under an understanding with
nintendo we cannot be assured that the final terms of the formal agreement will
be favorable

proliferation and assertion of patents poses serious risks to our business

     many patents have been issued that may apply to widely used game
technologies additionally many recently issued patents are now being asserted
against internet implementations of existing games several such patents have
been asserted against us such claims can harm our business we will incur
substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims regardless
of the merits of the claims in the event that there is a determination that we
have infringed a third party patent we could incur significant monetary
liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future

                  risk factors relating to our online business

because of eacoms limited operating history it will be difficult to evaluate
its business and prospects

     eacoms business is still in the developing stages so evaluating its
business and prospects will be more difficult than would be the case for a more
mature business we will continue to encounter the risks and difficulties faced
in launching a new business and we may not achieve our goals or may be
compelled to change the manner in which we seek to develop the business these
uncertainties as to the future operations of eacom will increase the difficulty
we face in completing and pursuing the essential plans for the development of
the business and will also make it more difficult for our stockholders and
securities analysts to predict the operating results of this business

eacom has a history of losses and expects to continue to incur losses and may
never achieve profitability

     eacom has incurred substantial losses to date including the current
fiscal year we expect eacom to continue to incur losses as it builds its
business eacom will be required to maintain the significant support service
and product enhancement demands of online users and we cannot be certain that
eacom will produce sufficient revenues from its operations to support these
costs even if profitability is achieved eacom may not be able to sustain it
over a period of time

our agreements with america online may not prove successful to the development
of eacoms business

     we have a series of agreements with america online aol for the offering
of our games for online play these agreements require that we make substantial
guaranteed payments to aol and that we commit our resources to the pursuit of
the online game opportunity we cannot be assured that the substantial costs
associated with the aol agreements will be justified by the revenues

                                       46

page

generated from that relationship in addition restrictions included in the aol
agreements limiting other channels we may develop for offering online games may
limit our ability to diversify our online distribution strategies the success
for us of the aol agreements will also be a result of aols performance under
the agreements a factor over which we will have very little control

we have limited experience with online games and may not be able to operate this
business effectively

     offering games solely for online play is a substantial departure from our
traditional business of selling packaged software games we have employed
various revenue models including subscription fees pay to play fees and
advertising we have limited experience with developing optimal pricing
strategies for online games for example our product majestic and our platinum
offering which contained certain browserbased entertainment games were
launched with a monthly subscription pricing model and obtained only limited
commercial success accordingly we did not realize our projected cash flows and
discontinued these offerings as part of eacoms restructuring plan similarly
we have limited experience in predicting usage patterns for our games because
of our inexperience in this area we may not be effective in achieving success
that may otherwise be attainable from offering our games online

online games have risks that are not associated with our traditional business

     online games particularly multiplayer games pose risks to player
enjoyment that do not generally apply to packaged goods games players
frequently would not be acquainted with other players which may adversely
affect the playing experience social issues raised by a players conduct may
impact the experience for other players it is difficult to monitor player
behavior that impairs the game experience in addition there are substantial
technical challenges to be met both in the introduction of our games online and
in maintaining an effective game playing environment over time also hacking
and spamming has become a serious problem for online sites and significant
hacking and spamming could seriously interfere with online game play if these
risks are not successfully controlled and technical challenges resolved
potential customers for our games may be unwilling to play in sufficient volume
to allow us to attain or sustain profitability

proliferation and assertion of patents poses serious risks to the business of
eacom

     many patents have been issued that may apply to widely used internet
technologies additionally many recently issued patents are now being asserted
against internet implementations of older technologies several such patents
have been asserted against us such claims can harm our business we will incur
substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims regardless
of the merits of the claims in the event that there is a determination that we
have infringed a third party patent we could incur significant monetary
liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future

development of eacoms business will require significant capital and we cannot
be assured that it will be available

     eacom will not be successful if it does not continue to receive
substantial financing that is required to continue to build its business
electronic arts has agreed to provide a limited amount of funding to eacom but
this financing alone may not be sufficient for the development of eacoms
business any additional funding that is obtained from electronic arts may
either be treated as a debt arrangement or would increase electronic arts
retained interest in eacom and correspondingly decrease the interest of the
holders of outstanding shares of class b common stock the attraction of
additional equity or debt financing for eacom from third parties may not be
possible or may only be possible on terms that result in significant dilution to
class a and class b common stockholders or incremental interest payments and
debtrelated restrictions on the operation of the business to date nearly all
funding except warrants and cash from revenues has been provided by electronic
arts

if use of the internet does not continue to develop and reliably support the
demands placed on it by electronic commerce eacoms business will be harmed

     eacoms success depends upon growth in the use of the internet as a medium
for playing games the use of the internet for sophisticated games like ours is
relatively new our business would be seriously harmed if

         use of the internet does not continue to increase or increases more
          slowly than expected

         the infrastructure for the internet does not effectively support
          online game play

         concerns over the secure transmission of confidential information over
          public networks inhibit the growth of the internet as a means of
          conducting commercial transactions or

                                       47

page

         government regulations regarding internet content privacy or other
          conditions impede the effectiveness of the internet to users

capacity restraints may restrict the use of the internet as a forum for game
play resulting in decreased demand for our products

     the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed
on it by increased usage or the limited capacity of networks to transmit large
amounts of data other risks associated with commercial use of the internet
could slow its growth including

         outages and other delays resulting from the inadequate reliability of
          the network infrastructure

         slow development of enabling technologies and complementary products
          and

         limited availability and adoption by consumers of costeffective high
          speed access

     delays in the development or adoption of new equipment standards or
protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity or increased
governmental regulation would cause the internet to fail to gain or lose
viability as a means of game playing if these or any other factors cause use of
the internet for commerce to slow or decline the internet may not prove viable
as a commercial marketplace this in turn would result in decreased demand for
eacoms products and services

to become and remain competitive eacom must continually develop new content
this is inherently risky and expensive

     eacoms success depends on our ability to develop new products and
services for the eacom site our agreement with aol requires us to develop new
games for the eacom site we cannot assure you that products will be developed
on time in a cost effective manner or that they will be commercially
successful currently the release of several products such as the sims online
and earth  beyond for which we expect to generate subscription revenue have
been delayed due to longer than anticipated development schedules similarly
the online product majestic achieved only limited commercial success due in part
to the length of time it took to download the online software component
accordingly we discontinued majestic on may 1 2002

we may not be able to respond to rapid technological change

     the market for internet products and services is characterized by rapid
technological change and evolving industry standards we will be required to
continually improve performance features reliability and capacity of our
network infrastructure we cannot assure you that we will be successful in
responding rapidly or in a cost effective manner to such developments

increasing governmental regulation of the internet could limit the market for
our products

     as internet commerce continues to evolve we expect that federal state and
foreign governments will adopt laws and regulations covering issues such as user
privacy taxation of goods and services provided over the internet pricing
content and quality of products and services it is possible that legislation
could expose companies involved in electronic commerce to liability taxation or
other increased costs any of which could limit the growth of electronic
commerce generally legislation could dampen the growth in internet usage and
decrease its acceptance as a communications and commercial medium if enacted
these laws and regulations could limit the market for eacoms products

our revenues have been heavily dependent on a single product and would be
adversely affected if that products popularity were to decline

     in the near term eacoms subscription revenues to date have consisted
primarily of revenues from sales of our online product ultima online and we
would be adversely affected if revenues from that product were to decline for
any reason and not be replaced we expect the online game market to become
increasingly competitive and it is possible that competing products could cause
revenues from ultima online to decline in addition popularity of ultima online
could decline over time simply because of consumer preference for new game
experiences

                                       48

we continue to invest in research and development and network technology and
operations for eacom and we cannot be assured that we will achieve revenues
that support this level of spending

     we have invested heavily and expect to continue to invest in research and
development and network technology and operations for our website and online
games while we have reduced the overall level of spending for eacom we will
continue to invest in the technologies tools and network infrastructure that
are necessary for us to launch and support our key products earth  beyond and
the sims online accordingly there are no assurances that the revenues from
these products will exceed the associated costs in order for eacom to achieve
profitability if we cannot increase revenues to profitable levels the value of
eacom will be impaired in order to develop the broad game offerings that we
envision for our online operations it will continue to be necessary to engage in
significant developmental efforts both to adapt existing electronic arts games
to the online format and to create new online games our agreements with aol
require us to maintain a substantial commitment to online game development and
we cannot be assured that we will realize acceptable returns from this
investment

online product development schedules are unreliable and make predicting
quarterly results difficult

     online product development schedules particularly for internet based games
are difficult to predict because they involve creative processes use of new
development tools internet latency issues a learning process to better
understand internet based game mechanics and research and experimentation
associated with development for new online technologies additionally
development risks for internet based products can cause particular difficulties
in predicting quarterly results because of the challenges associated with game
testing live beta testing integration into network servers and integration on
to the games web site and may impact the release go live dates of products
during a particular quarter several online products currently under development
such as the sims online and earth  beyond have experienced development delays
and will be released later than planned our revenues and operating costs are
dependent on our ability to meet our product go live schedules and our
failure to meet those schedules could result in revenues falling short of
analysts expectations resulting in increased operating losses for eacom

we are heavily dependent on a few internet infrastructure service providers to
host and manage our servers at colocation facilities and our operating results
may be adversely affected if we must change service providers

     we are dependent on a few third party internet infrastructure service
providers to host and manage the majority of our servers that support our online
games the performance of these service providers are outside of our control
many of the service providers in the internet infrastructure space require
substantial financial resources to build maintain and manage colocation
facilities to the extent that industry economic financial or competitive
factors influence the level of performance that we expect from service providers
we currently use for colocation space bandwidth and rack we may need to
relocate our servers to another colocation facility which would increase our
expenses and may result in delays or reduced shipments of our online products
thereby adversely impact our operating results

                              general risk factors

because of the competition for qualified technical creative marketing and
other personnel we may not be able to attract and retain the personnel
necessary for our businesses

     the market for technical creative marketing and other personnel essential
to the development of online businesses and management of our online and core
businesses continues to be competitive although current market conditions have
made it less difficult to attract and retain the employees we need in the last
fiscal year notwithstanding the downturn of the economy generally competitive
recruiting efforts aimed at electronic arts employees and executives continued
electronic arts leading position within the interactive entertainment industry
makes us a prime target for recruiting of executives and key creative talent to
assist in the consolidation that the interactive entertainment industry is
experiencing in addition the cost of real estate in the san francisco bay area
 the location of our headquarters and largest studio remains relatively high
and has made recruiting from other areas and relocating employees to our
headquarters more difficult if we cannot successfully recruit and retain the
employees we need our ability to develop and manage our businesses will be
impaired

foreign sales and currency fluctuations

     for the fiscal years ended march 31 2002 and 2001 international net
revenues comprised 37 of total consolidated net revenues we expect foreign
sales to continue to account for a significant and growing portion of our
revenues such sales are subject to unexpected regulatory requirements tariffs
and other barriers additionally foreign sales are primarily made in local
currencies which may fluctuate while we hedge against foreign currency
fluctuations we cannot control translation issues for example our

                                       49

page

japan and asia pacific revenues in fiscal 2002 were adversely impacted by a
devaluation of the yen and australian dollar as compared to the prior year the
devaluation had an adverse effect for the year on our net revenues and net
income any of these factors may significantly harm our business

increased difficulties in forecasting results

     during platform transition periods where the success of our products is
significantly impacted by the changing market for our products forecasting our
revenues and earnings is more difficult than in more stable or rising product
markets the demand for our products may decline during a transition faster than
we anticipate negatively impacting both revenues and earnings at launch sony
shipped only half of the number of playstation 2 units to retail in north
america than it had originally planned and it shipped significantly fewer units
than planned at launch in europe as well shortages were announced as being
caused by shortages of components for manufacturing due to these shortages our
results of operations for fiscal 2001 were adversely affected consequently if
microsoft or nintendo do not ship the number of units planned for the xbox and
nintendo gamecube our sales of these products may be adversely affected in
fiscal 2002

the current legislative and regulatory environment affecting generally accepted
accounting principles is uncertain and volatile and significant changes in
current principles could affect our financial statements going forward

     recent actions and public comments from the sec have focused on the
integrity of financial reporting generally similarly congress has considered a
variety of bills that could affect certain accounting principles in addition
the fasb and other regulatory accounting agencies have recently introduced
several new or proposed accounting standards some of which represent a
significant change from current industry practices while we do not anticipate
that such proposals will affect the actual conduct of our business and we
believe that our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles we cannot predict the impact of the
adoption of any such proposals on our financial statements going forward

fluctuations in stock price

     due to analysts expectations of continued growth and other factors any
shortfall in earnings could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on
the trading price of our common stock in any given period as a result of the
factors discussed in this report and other factors that may arise in the future
the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will
continue to be subject to significant fluctuations over a short period of time
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us to changes in analysts
earnings estimates or to factors affecting the computer software internet
entertainment media or electronics businesses in addition fluctuations may be
due to uncertainties in the securities markets in general for example during
the fiscal year ended march 31 2001 the price per share of our class a common
stock ranged from 2659 to 5613 and 4240 to 6601 during the fiscal year
ended march 31 2002

world events

     the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 in the unites states the
subsequent us military action and the continuing concerns over potential
additional terrorist attacks against us interests and citizens pose serious
uncertainties in our business consumer spending consumer preferences in
entertainment and the securities markets generally may be affected on an
ongoing and unpredictable basis by these events all of which may make
prediction of our results more difficult

because of these and other factors affecting our operating results and financial
condition past financial performance should not be considered a reliable
indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends
to anticipate results or trends in future periods

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risk

we are exposed to various market risks including the changes in foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates market risk is the potential loss
arising from changes in market rates and prices foreign exchange contracts used
to hedge foreign currency exposures and shortterm investments are subject to
market risk we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be subject to
interest rate risk due to their short maturities we do not enter into
derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes

foreign currency exchange rate risk

we utilize foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures of
underlying assets and liabilities primarily certain intercompany receivables
that are denominated in foreign currencies thereby limiting our risk gains
and losses on foreign exchange contracts are reflected in the consolidated
statement of operations at march 31 2002 we had foreign exchange contracts
all with maturities of less than three months to purchase and sell approximately
226330000 in foreign currencies primarily british pounds european currency
units euro canadian dollars and other currencies

fair value represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate
and the forward rate the counterparties to these contracts are substantial and
creditworthy multinational commercial banks the risks of counterparty
nonperformance associated with these contracts are not considered to be
material notwithstanding our efforts to manage foreign exchange risks there
can be no assurances that our hedging activities will adequately protect us
against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations

while the contract amounts provide one measurement of the volume of these
transactions they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk
the amounts arising from the possible inabilities of counterparties to meet the
terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts if any by which
the counterparties obligations exceed our obligations as these contracts can be
settled on a net basis at our option we control credit risk through credit
approvals limits and monitoring procedures

interest rate risk

our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily
to our investment portfolio we do not use derivative financial instruments in
our investment portfolio we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an
investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments of high credit
quality and relatively short average maturities we also manage our interest
rate risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that
we are typically able to hold our investments to maturity at march 31 2002

         sony

         sony  released  the  playstation  2 console in japan in march 2000  in
north  america in october 2000 and in europe in november  2000  compared to the
initial  forecast for  playstation 2 hardware  shipments from sony  there was a
significant  shortage of  playstation 2 hardware  units during the year in north
america and europe according to sony this was due to component shortages which
limited  the number of units  that  could be  manufactured  the  playstation  2
console is a 128bit  digital  versatile

disk dvd based system that is internet and cable ready  as well as backward
compatible  with the current  playstation  console  software  we currently have
various products under development for the sony playstation 2 console  see risk
factors  new video game  platforms  create  additional  technical and business
model uncertainties

         nintendo

         nintendo  announced that it expects to release the nintendo gamecube in
north america in november 2001  nintendo  gamecube will provide for games to be
delivered and played using a proprietary optical format

         microsoft

         microsoft  announced  that it expects to release  its first  video game
system xboxtm in north america in november 2001

         new entrants

         new  entrants  into  the  interactive   entertainment   and  multimedia
industries  such as cable  television  telephone  and  diversified  media and
entertainment  companies  in addition to a proliferation  of new  technologies
such as online networks and the internet  have increased the competition in our
markets  we are scheduled to release  several online  network  gaming  products
during  fiscal  2002  see risk  factors   new  video  game  platforms  create
additional  technical  and  business  model  uncertainties  and the  impact of
ecommerce and online games on our business is not known 

         the early investment in products for the 32bit market  including both
compact disk personal computer or pc and dedicated entertainment systems that
we call video game systems or  consoles  has been  strategically  important in
positioning us for the current  generation of 128bit machines  we believe that
such  investment  continues to be  important  during the fiscal year 2001  the
video and computer games  industry has  experienced a platform  transition  from
32bit and 64bit cdbased consoles to the current  generation 128bit dvdbased
game consoles and related  software  the  transition to the current  generation
systems was initiated by the launch of sonys  playstation 2 in fiscal 2001 and
continues with the anticipated  launch in north america of the nintendo gamecube
and microsofts  xbox in the fall of calendar year 2001 as the market continues
to shift to the current generation  systems  sales of current 32bit and 64bit
products have been declining and we expect a significant decline in fiscal 2002
in addition  our revenues and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our
product release schedule and our failure to meet those schedules could result in
revenues  and  earnings  which  fall  short  of  analysts  expectations  in any
individual  quarter  see risk  factors   product  development  schedules  are
frequently unreliable and make predicting quarterly results difficult

         online games

         according to the market research firm  international  data corporation
idc  online  gamers  defined as  individuals  who have played online games
within the past year are  expected to grow to 747 million by 2004 up from 394
million in 2000  idc expects total online gaming market revenue to grow to 17
billion by 2002  we believe the  expected  increases  in online  gaming will be
primarily attributable to the following factors

 o       increasing popularity of pc gaming

 o       growing interest in multiplayer games

 o       growth in the number of households with pcs and internet connections

 o       general  growth  in  internet  usage  including  the  number of users
         communities and increased frequency of use by consumers

 o       rapid innovation of new online entertainment experiences

 o       mass market adoption of broadband technologies and

 o       future  introduction of online gaming  capabilities for nextgeneration
         consoles


competition

         ea core

         see risk factors  our platform  licensors  are our chief  competitors
and frequently control the manufacturing of our video game products

         eacom

we believe eacom faces  substantial  competition  from a number of existing and
potential competitors including

 o       console  pc game  publishers  other game  publishers  including  sony
         computer  entertainment of america sony  nintendo  sega acclaim
         havas microsoft  lucasarts interplay infogrames and eidos are each
         developing  individual  online games and games with online  components

         operates the sony station a site that offers not only  familyoriented
         game shows but also online game offerings  including the online game
         everquest  a virtual world that directly competes with eacoms ultima
         online  game  in  addition  sony has made public its  intentions  for
         online connectivity via its nextgeneration console the playstation 2
         though detailed plans have not been disclosed in 2000 sega introduced
         seganet an online gaming internet subscriptionbased service optimized
         for  use  with  its  dreamcast  video  game  console  however  segas
         subsequent decision to discontinue the dreamcast will impact this plan
         in  2001  sega  executives  have  made  public  statements  about  the
         companys  plans for  supporting  the online  gaming  functionality  of
         consoles produced by sony and microsoft  each of these competitors may
         compete with eacom for advertising subscription and ecommerce sales

 o       portals  with respect to advertising and ecommerce sales eacom will
         also  compete with  general  purpose  consumer web sites such as yahoo
         excite  lycos  and  microsoft  network  in  addition  many of these
         internet portals offer gaming sites such as yahoo games channel excite
         games channel  lycos gamesville  and microsoft gaming zone although
         most of the game areas of these  portals have  attained  modest  reach
         their  key  placement  on  powerful   portals  makes  them  potentially
         significant competitors for gaming subscriptions as well

 o       family  oriented  game  sites  a number of sites  such as  uproarcom
         gamescom and shockwavecom have driven significant amounts of traffic
         to their sites by offering unique games and entertainment  content  in
         addition  several of the sites offer frequent prizes with easy to play
         gamettes  these  sites are  typically  monetizing  their  traffic by
         selling advertising

 o       aggregators  aggregators  such as microsoft  gaming zone  provide an
         aggregation of various types of online games  including aggregation of
         games  developed by independent  third parties  while these sites have
         been primarily focused on serving the gaming community they have since
         adjusted their strategy to include  games  such as parlor games  that
         reach a broader audience

 o       sports sites sports content sites such as espncom sportslinecom and
         foxsportscom  typically  feature fantasy league games and easy to play
         sports gamettes in addition to their editorial content  such fantasy
         league  games and sports  gamettes  typically  appeal to the  overall
         sports fan  rather than the sports  gamer  however  these sites have
         significant  financial and content resources at their disposal and will
         provide competition for advertising and ecommerce sales

 o       microsoft  gaming zone  mgz  microsoft  falls into a number of the
         foregoing categories as it is a portal an aggregator and a publisher
         of pc software products  including game products as such microsofts
         offerings are the closest parallel to the proposed offerings of eacom
         mgz currently  offers both family games and games directed  towards the
         more  serious  gamer and  at the same  time  has the  opportunity  to
         leverage these experiences with games sold at retail  at present  mgz
         offers  matchmaking  for about 80 games  and  offers  approximately  30
         playable  online  games  which  consist  primarily  of card and parlor
         games in addition  microsoft could utilize this site in some way with
         its forthcoming xbox console to develop an online gaming service

relationships with significant hardware platform companies

         sony

         in fiscal 2001 approximately 20 of our net revenues were derived from
sales of software  for the  playstation  2 we released 15 titles  worldwide  in
fiscal 2001 for the playstation 2 key releases for the year included madden nfl
2001  ssx  fifa  2001  nba live 2001 and nhl 2001  revenues  were lower than
expected due to the  shortage of  playstation  2 hardware in the year  resulting
from  component  shortages  which  limited  the  number of units  that  could be
manufactured  according to sony we expect sony to correct these issues for the
next fiscal year  and expect  revenues  from  playstation 2 products to grow in
fiscal 2002

         in fiscal 2001 approximately 23 of our net revenues were derived from
sales of software for the  playstation  compared to 41 in fiscal  2000  during
fiscal 2001 we released 17 playstation  games compared to 30 in fiscal 2000 as
expected playstation sales decreased for fiscal 2001 compared to the prior year
primarily  attributable  to  releasing  fewer  games  and to the  playstation  2
platform  transition  with the  exception of madden nfl all of our  franchises
experienced  significant  decreases  from  prior  year  release   although  our
playstation  products are playable on the playstation 2 console we expect sales
of current playstation  products to continue to decline  significantly in fiscal
2002  see  risk  factors    product  development   schedules  are  frequently
unreliable and make predicting quarterly results difficult

         under  the  terms of a  licensing  agreement  entered  into  with  sony
computer  entertainment  of  america  in july 1994 the  sony  agreement  as
amended  we are authorized to develop and distribute cdbased software products
compatible with the playstation  furthermore  under the terms of an additional
licensing agreement entered into with sony computer  entertainment of america as
of april 2000 the playstation 2 agreement  as amended we are authorized to
develop  and  distribute   dvdbased  software  products   compatible  with  the

playstation  2 cds and  dvds  for  distribution  by us  accordingly  we have
limited  ability to control our supply of playstation  and  playstation 2 cd and
dvd products or the timing of their  delivery  see risk factors  our platform
licensors are our chief competitors and frequently  control the manufacturing of
our video game products

         nintendo

         during fiscal 2001 we released three titles for the n64r compared to
eight  titles  in  fiscal  2000  in fiscal  2001  approximately  5 of our net
revenues were derived from the sale of n64 products  compared to 8 in 2000 the
expected  decrease in n64 revenues  for the fiscal  year  compared to the prior
fiscal year was primarily due to fewer  releases  the decrease was also due to
the weaker  market for n64  products  in the  current  year  with the  expected
release of nintendo gamecube in north america in november 2001 per nintendo we
expect revenues for n64 products to continue to decline  significantly in fiscal
2002 the key release for the year was the world is not enough

         under the terms of the n64 agreement we engage nintendo to manufacture
our n64 cartridges for distribution by us accordingly  we have limited ability
to control  our supply of n64  cartridges  or the  timing of their  delivery  a
shortage of  microchips  or other  factors  outside our control could impair our
ability to obtain an  adequate  supply of  cartridges  see risk  factors  our
platform  licensors  are  our  chief  competitors  and  frequently  control  the

products and product development

         in fiscal 2001  we generated  approximately  59 of our revenues  from
products  released  during the year  see risk  factors   product  development
schedules  are  frequently  unreliable  and make  predicting  quarterly  results
difficult  as of march 31 2001 we were actively  marketing  over 100 titles
comprising  over 150 stock keeping units  or skus  that were published by our
development  divisions  and  subsidiaries  ea studios  during  fiscal 2001 we
introduced over 35 ea studios titles representing over 55 skus compared to 48
ea studios titles comprising over 69 skus in fiscal 2000

         the  products  published  by ea studios are designed and created by our
inhouse   designers  and  artists  and  by  independent   software   developers
independent  artists  we typically pay the  independent  artists  royalties
based  on  the  sales  of the  specific  products  as  defined  in the  related
independent artist agreements

         for fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 no title  represented  revenues greater
than 10 of our total fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 net revenues

         we publish  products in a number of categories such as sports  action
strategy  simulations  role playing and  adventure  each of which is becoming
increasingly  competitive  our sportsrelated  products  marketed under the ea
sportstm brand name accounted for a significant percentage of net revenues in
fiscal years 2001 2000 and 1999 there can be no assurance that we will be able
to maintain our market share in the sports category

         the front line retail  selling prices in north america of our products
excluding older titles marketed as classics  typically range from 3500 to
5500  classics  titles have retail selling prices that range from 1000 to
3000  the retail  selling  prices of ea titles  outside of north america vary

published   titles  in  north  america  and  over  4000  affiliated  label  and
copublished  titles  in the  rest of the  world  no  single  affiliated  label
publisher has accounted for more than 10 of our net revenues in any of the last
three fiscal years

         in may 1998  electronic  arts and square co ltd  formed a new joint
venture in north america  creating square electronic arts llc square ea as
discussed  in note 14 of the  notes to the  consolidated  financial  statements
included  in item 8 hereof  in  conjunction  with the  formation  of this joint
venture  we have the exclusive  right in north  america to distribute  products
published  by this joint  venture  in fiscal 2001  square ea  published  final
fantasy 9 for the playstation  which was a top ten selling title for electronic
arts

         we generated  approximately 95 of our north american net revenues from
direct sales to retailers  through a field sales  organization of  professionals
and a group of telephone  sales  representatives  the remaining 5 of our north
american sales were made through a limited  number of  specialized  and regional
distributors and rack jobbers in markets where we believe direct sales would not
be economical for each of the fiscal years ended march 31 2001 2000 and 1999
we had sales to one customer  walmart stores  inc which  represented 12 of
total net revenues

         the  video  game and pc  businesses  have  become  increasingly  hits
driven   requiring   significantly   greater  expenditures  for  marketing  and
advertising  particularly for television advertising there can be no assurance
that we will  continue to produce  hit  titles  or that  advertising  for any
product will increase sales sufficiently to recoup those advertising expenses

         we have  stockbalancing  programs for our personal  computer  products
that under certain  circumstances and up to a specified  amount  allow for the
exchange of personal computer  products by resellers  we also typically provide
for price  protection for our personal  computer and video game system  products
that  under certain  conditions  allows the reseller a price reduction from us
for unsold  products  we  maintain a policy of  exchanging  products  or giving
credits but do not give cash refunds moreover the risk of product returns may
increase as new hardware  platforms  become more popular or market factors force
us to make changes in our distribution  system we monitor and manage the volume
of our sales to retailers and distributors and their  inventories as substantial
overstocking  in the  distribution  channel  can  result in high  returns or the
requirement for substantial price protection in subsequent  periods  we believe
that we provide  adequate  reserves for returns and price  protection  which are
based on estimated future returns of products  taking into account  promotional
activities  the timing of new product  introductions  distributor and retailer
inventories of our products and other factors  we believe our current  reserves
will be sufficient to meet return and price protection  requirements for current
inchannel inventory  however there can be no assurance that actual returns or
price protection will not exceed our reserves

         within the eacom site we offer  visitors the  opportunity to purchase
electronic  arts  software  products  directly  from us  we  utilize  ea cores
distribution  network  to  fulfill  consumers  online  orders  we also  have a
fulfillment  group that sells product directly to consumers  through a tollfree
number and through our websites  listed in  advertising by us and our affiliated
labels  this group is also  responsible  for targeted direct mail marketing and
sells product backups and accessories to registered customers

         the distribution  channels through which consumer software products are
sold have been characterized by change  including  consolidations and financial
difficulties  of certain  distributors  and  retailers  and the emergence of new
retailers  such as general mass  merchandisers  the  development  of remote and
electronic delivery systems will create further changes the bankruptcy or other
business  difficulties  of a distributor  or retailer  could render our accounts
receivable from such entity uncollectible which could have an adverse effect on
our operating results and financial condition in addition an increasing number
of companies  are  competing  for access to these  channels  in fiscal 2001 we
wrote off approximately 1000000 of a receivable as a result of the default of
payment from a customer in europe  our  arrangements  with our distributors and
retailers  may be  terminated  by  either  party  at  any  time  without  cause
distributors  and  retailers  often  carry  products  that  compete  with  ours
retailers of our  products  typically  have a limited  amount of shelf space and
promotional  resources for which there is intense  competition  there can be no
assurance that distributors and retailers will continue to purchase our products
or provide our  products  with  adequate  levels of shelf space and  promotional
support

         international net revenues decreased by 14 to 490349000  or 37 of
consolidated  fiscal  2001 net  revenues  compared  to  573374000  or 40 of
consolidated fiscal 2000 net revenues due to the following

 o   europes  net  revenues   decreased   21  primarily  due  to  the  console
     transition  lower  affiliated label sales due to product release slips and
     fewer hit titles  released in the current  year  lower pc sales with fewer
     titles  shipping  in the  period  the  strong  sales of command  conquer
     tiberian  sun tm for the pc in the  comparable  prior  year  period  and
     weakness in the euro currency in addition  playstation revenues decreased
     43 due to fewer titles shipping during the console  transition period with
     most  franchise  titles showing  significant  decreases from the prior year
     releases playstation 2 revenues did not offset the decrease in playstation
     revenues due to fewer  hardware units reaching the market and the weighting
     of titles  specifically  appropriate  for the north american  market rather
     than the european market

 o   asia  pacifics  net revenues  decreased  4 mainly due to the decrease in
     playstation  revenues as there were no significant  new titles  released in
     the current year  this was offset by sales of playstation 2 titles such as
     ssx and fifa 2001

 o   offset by japans net revenues  which  increased  58 compared to the prior
     year  primarily  due to the shipment of  playstation  2 titles such as fifa
     world soccer championship fifa 2001 and ssx

         though  international  revenues  are  expected to grow in fiscal  2002
international  revenues  may not grow at as high a rate as in prior  years  see
risk factors  our business  our products and our distribution are subject to
increasing  regulation  in key  territories  and  foreign  sales and  currency
fluctuations


manufacturing and suppliers

         materials

         in  many   instances   we  are  able  to   acquire   materials   on  a
volumediscount  basis  we have multiple  potential  sources of supply for most
materials  except  with  respect  to our  playstation  playstation  2 and  n64
products  as  previously  mentioned  we also have  alternate  sources  for the
manufacture  and  assembly  of most  of our  products  to  date  we  have  not
experienced  any material  difficulties  or delays in production of our software
and related  documentation and packaging  however  a shortage of components or
other  factors  beyond our control could impair our ability to  manufacture  or
have manufactured  our products see risk factors  our platform licensors are
our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of our video game
products


backlog

         we normally ship products  within a few days after receipt of an order
however  a backlog may occur for ea studio and  affiliated  label products that
have been announced for release but not yet shipped  we do not consider backlog
to be an indicator of future performance


seasonality

         our business is highly  seasonal  we typically  experience our highest
revenues and profits in the calendar  yearend holiday season and a seasonal low
in revenues and profits in the quarter  ending in june in our 2002 fiscal year
and  particularly in the june and september  quarters  we expect these seasonal
trends to be  magnified  by general  industry  factors  including  the  current
platform  transition  the  concentration  of our product releases in the second
half of fiscal 2002 and uncertain  economic  conditions in the united states in
addition  we are continuing to invest  significantly  in our online  operation
eacom accordingly we expect significant operating losses in the first half of
fiscal  2002  see risk  factors    platform  transitions  such as the one now
occurring  typically

                                       11
page

depress the market for video game software  until new  platforms  achieve a wide
market acceptance and our business is both seasonal and cyclical


employees

         as of march 31 2001 we employed  approximately  3500 people of whom
over  1400  were  outside  the  united  states  of  this  amount  there  were
approximately  700 eacom  fulltime  employees  we believe that our ability to
attract and retain qualified  employees is an important factor in our growth and
development  and that our future success will depend  in large measure  on our
ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees  to date we have
been  successful in recruiting  and  retaining  sufficient  numbers of qualified
personnel  to conduct our  business  successfully  see risk  factors  we face
intense  competition  for talent from  competitors  and because of the intense
competition for qualified technical creative marketing and other personnel we
may not be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for our business

north america net revenues

the decrease in north  america net  revenues for fiscal 2001  compared to fiscal
2000 was primarily attributable to

 o   expected  declines in sales of  playstation  and nintendo 64 n64 titles
     due to the  beginning  of  the  transition  to  next  generation  consoles
     playstation net revenues  decreased 49 and n64 net revenues  decreased 46
     also due to fewer titles shipping in the current year for both platforms

 o   a 6  decrease  in al  revenues  primarily  due  to the  acquisition  of an
     affiliate dreamworks interactive by electronic arts in the fourth quarter
     of the prior fiscal year

 o   offset  partially by the launch of  playstation 2 platform in north america
     which  generated  171034000  in revenue for the year from titles such as
     madden nfl 2001  ssx nba live 2001 and nhl 2001  playstation  2 revenues
     did not offset the decrease in playstation revenues due to a reduced number
     of hardware units reaching the market due to hardware component  shortages
     according to sony

 o   offset by a 21 increase in pc revenues due to the shipment of key releases
     including  command  conquer  red alert 2 and the sims  livin  large and
     continued strong catalog sales of the sims

international net revenues

the decrease in  international  net revenues for fiscal 2001  compared to fiscal
2000 was attributable to the following

 o   europes  net  revenues   decreased   21  primarily  due  to  the  console
     transition  lower al sales  due to  product  release  slips  and fewer hit
     titles  released  in the  current  year  lower pc sales with fewer  titles
     shipping in the  period  the strong  sales of command  conquer  tiberian
     suntm for the pc in the comparable prior year period and weakness in the
     euro currency in addition playstation revenues decreased 43 due to fewer
     titles  shipping during the console  transition  period with most franchise
     titles  showing  significant   decreases  from  the  prior  year  releases
     playstation 2 revenues did not offset the decrease in playstation  revenues
     due to fewer hardware units reaching the market and the weighting of titles
     specifically  appropriate  for the north  american  market  rather than the
     european market

 o   asia  pacifics  net revenues  decreased  4 mainly due to the decrease in
     playstation  revenues as there were no significant  new titles  released in
     the current year  this was offset by sales of playstation 2 titles such as
     ssx and fifa 2001

 o   offset by japans net revenues  which  increased  58 compared to the prior
     year  primarily  due to the shipment of  playstation  2 titles such as fifa
     soccer world championship fifa 2001 and ssx

personal computer product net revenues

the increase in sales of pc products for fiscal 2001 was primarily  attributable
to the continued  strong sales of the sims which shipped in the prior year key
current year releases were command  conquer  red alert 2 and the sims  livin
large  we released 20 pc titles in fiscal 2001  compared to 31 titles in fiscal
2000  the sims  continues to be the number one pc title and has now sold over 4
million copies  due to the sales of the sims in fiscal 2001 we expect revenues
from pc products to be flat or lower in fiscal 2002

playstation product net revenues

we released 17 playstation  titles in fiscal 2001 compared to 30 in fiscal 2000
as expected  playstation  sales decreased for fiscal 2001 compared to the prior
year primarily  attributable to the playstation 2 platform  transition and fewer
titles  with the  exception  of madden nfl all of our  franchises  experienced
significant  decreases  from the prior year  release  although our  playstation
products are playable on the  playstation 2 console  we expect sales of current
playstation products to continue to decline significantly in fiscal 2002

under the  terms of a  licensing  agreement  entered  into  with  sony  computer
entertainment of america in july 1994 the sony agreement as amended we are
authorized to develop and distribute  cdbased software products compatible with
the  playstation  furthermore  under  the  terms  of an  additional  licensing
agreement  entered into with sony computer  entertainment of america as of april
2000 the playstation 2 agreement  as amended  we are authorized to develop
and distribute  dvdbased  software products  compatible with the playstation 2
pursuant  to these  agreements  we engage  sony to supply its  playstation  and
playstation 2 cds for distribution by us accordingly  we have limited ability
to control our supply of playstation and playstation 2 cd products or the timing
of their delivery

playstation 2 product net revenues

we  released  15 titles  worldwide  in fiscal  2001 for the  playstation  2 key
releases for the year included  madden nfl 2001  ssx fifa 2001  nba live 2001
and nhl 2001 revenue was lower than expected due to the shortage of playstation
2 hardware in the year  resulting  from  component  shortages  which limited the
number of units that could be manufactured according to sony we expect sony to
correct  these  issues  for the next  fiscal  year  and  expect  revenues  from
playstation 2 products to grow in fiscal 2002

affiliated label product net revenues

the decrease in  affiliated  label net revenues for fiscal 2001  compared to the
prior fiscal year was primarily due to the strong sales of final fantasyr viii
in the prior year our acquisition of dreamworks interactive formerly an al in
the fourth quarter of the prior year  fewer hit al product releases and product
release slips in europe

n64 product net revenues

we released  three n64 titles in fiscal 2001  compared  to eight  titles  during
fiscal 2000 the expected decrease in n64 revenues for the fiscal year compared
to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to fewer releases  the decrease was
also due to the weaker  market for n64  products in the current  year  with the
expected  release of nintendo  gamecube in north america in november  2001  per
nintendo   we  expect   revenues  for  n64  products  to  continue  to  decline
significantly  in fiscal 2002 the key release for the year was the world is not
enough

under the terms of the n64 agreement  we engage nintendo to manufacture our n64
cartridges  for  distribution  by us  accordingly  we have  little  ability to
control our supply of n64 cartridges or the timing of their delivery a shortage
of microchips  or other factors  outside our control could impair our ability to
obtain an adequate supply of cartridges

online net revenues

the  increase in online  revenues for fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 was
attributable to the following

 o       the average number of paying  customers for ultima online  increased to
         approximately  200000 for fiscal 2001 as compared to over  140000 for
         fiscal 2000 this increase was due to continued  strong sales of ultima
         online the addition of new events and parties within the ultima worlds
         and the release of ultima online renaissance in april 2000

 o       we generated over  5100000 in  subscription  revenues for kesmai and
         worldplay online games for fiscal 2001 these products were not part of
         eacom last year due to the kesmai acquisition in the fourth quarter of
         fiscal 2000  revenues  associated with these services will continue to
         decrease  as  some  of  these  products  will  be  converted  into  our
         advertising  supported  free offerings or  incorporated  in our bundled
         subscription offerings

license oem and other revenues

the decrease in license  oem and other  revenues for fiscal 2001 as compared to
fiscal 2000 was primarily a result of lower license revenue of certain titles on
the game boy platform

advertising

following  the launch of eacom on the world wide web and the aol games  channel
in october we began selling advertising on eacom and aol properties including
the slingo game  in  addition  we  generated  advertising  revenue from pogos
websites as a result of the  purchase of pogo  corporation  now  referred to as
pogo in february 2001

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues  decreased in
fiscal 2001 due to

 o       an  increase  in sales of higher  margin pc titles as a  percentage  of
         revenues  the current year included  sales on titles such as the sims
         command  conquer red alert 2 and the sims livin large

 o       the introduction of higher margin playstation 2 products in the current
         year

 o       a decrease in sales of lower margin al and n64 titles

 o       an increase in higher margin online and advertising revenue

 o       offset by a decrease in sales of playstation  titles  combined with the
         decrease in average  margins on playstation  products due to a decrease
         in the average sales price on front line and catalogue products

marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses for fiscal 2001 increased as a
percentage of revenue primarily attributed to

 o       higher  eacom  marketing  and sales  expenses due to  increased  staff
         required to support the live game site and advertising campaigns run on
         the aol service promoting the games channel in future periods  eacom
         intends to further increase marketing and advertising spending in order
         to promote our game site and the games channel on aol

 o       the  amortization  of the aol carriage fee which began with the launch
         of eacom in october of the current fiscal year

 o       offset by lower  television and print  advertising in north america and
         europe due to fewer number of releases compared to last year

general and administrative  general and administrative expenses increased 126
for fiscal 2001 primarily attributed to

 o       the expansion of the eacom staff and additional administrativerelated
         costs required to support the growth of the eacom business

 o       increase in bad debts due to a write off of a receivable as a result of
         the  default of payment  from a  customer  in europe for  approximately
         1000000

 o       increase in depreciation  expense for europe due to the  implementation
         of a new transaction processing system

research and development  excluding network development and support  research
and development expenses increased in absolute dollars by 382 for fiscal 2001
primarily attributed to

 o       increase  in research  and  development  expenses by eacom  including
         expenses incurred by ea core on behalf of eacom due to an increase in
         the number of online projects in development and increased  development
         staff to  support  these  products  the type of games  that will be in
         development will most likely increase in complexity and depth

 o       an  increase  in  development  spending  for  next  generation  console
         products including  development for the playstation 2 console xbox and
         nintendo gamecube

 o       the increase is also due to research and development  expenses  related
         to the acquisition of dreamworks  interactive  a software  development
         company in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year

 o       increased  headcount related costs associated with the formation of our
         customer relationship management organization for the live game site

we released a total of 55 new packaged goods products in fiscal 2001 compared to
69 new products in fiscal  2000  in addition  the eacom  website  launched in
october 2000 and has over 80 live games

network development and support the increase in network development and support
expenses was primarily due to increased spending for the network infrastructure
and the games  channel on the aol service and the  amortization  of  capitalized
costs  as  required  under  sop 981  associated  with  the  prelaunch  network
infrastructure  build  as a result  we expect network  development and support
expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future

charge for acquired inprocess technology

fiscal 2001

in  connection  with the  acquisition  of pogo in the fourth  fiscal  quarter of
fiscal 2001 we allocated and expensed  2719000 of the  43333000  purchase
price to acquired inprocess technology at the date of acquisition this amount
was expensed as a nonrecurring charge as the inprocess  technology had not yet
reached  technological  feasibility and had no alternative future uses pogo had
various  projects  in  progress  at  the  time  of  the  acquisition  as of the
acquisition  date costs to complete pogo projects  acquired were expected to be
approximately  1200000  in future  periods  we  believe  there  have been no
significant changes to these estimates

                                       26
page

as of march 31 2001 we currently  expect to complete the  development of these
projects at various dates  through  fiscal 2002 and to publish the projects upon
completion   in   conjunction   with  the   acquisition  of  pogo  we  accrued
approximately 100000 related to direct transaction and other related costs

fiscal 2000

 o       in connection  with the  acquisition  of kesmai by eacom in the fourth
         quarter of fiscal 2000  we allocated  and expensed  3869000  of the
         purchase price to acquired inprocess technology

 o       in connection with the acquisitions of two development  companies by ea
         core made in the 2nd and 4th quarters of fiscal 2000 we allocated and
         expensed  2670000  of the  purchase  price  to  acquired  inprocess
         technology

these charges were made after we concluded  that the  inprocess  technology had
not reached  technological  feasibility and had no alternative  future use after
taking into  consideration  the potential for usage of the software in different
products and resale of the software

amortization of intangibles  the amortization of intangibles  results primarily
from the acquisitions of westwood kesmai dreamworks interactive abc software
pogo and other acquisitions  amortization of intangibles was 12829000 for ea
core and 6494000 for eacom for fiscal 2001  amortization of intangibles was
10866000 for ea core and 1123000 for eacom for fiscal 2000

interest and other income  net  interest and other income  net  increased in
absolute  dollars  primarily due to higher interest income as a result of higher
average cash balances and investing in higher yielding taxable securities in the
current year  those gains were  partially  offset by realized gains on sales of
marketable securities in the prior year

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 310 for fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000
at march 31  2001  we  generated a federal  income tax net  operating  loss a
substantial  portion of this loss will be utilized in a carryback claim with the
remainder being carried forward a valuation  allowance has not been established
on this loss  carryforward  or other net deferred tax assets as we believe it is
more  likely  than not that the  results  of  future  operations  will  generate
sufficient taxable income to realize them

net income loss in absolute dollars  reported net income loss decreased in
fiscal 2001  primarily  related to lower  revenues  as well as higher  costs and
expenses  compared to the same period last year  the  decrease in revenues  was
primarily  due to the  beginning  of the  transition  period to next  generation
console  systems  the  increase in expenses was  primarily  due to increases in
development  of next  generation  console  products in the core business and the
investment  in eacom  including  expenses  to build  network  and online  game
products and to launch our game sites in october 2000

excluding goodwill  noncash compensation and onetime charges in the amount of
17077000  net of  taxes  for  fiscal  2001  net  income  would  have  been
5995000  excluding goodwill  noncash  compensation and onetime charges in
the amount of 13292000  net of taxes for fiscal 2000 net income would have
been 130043000

north america net revenues

the increase in north  america net  revenues for fiscal 2000  compared to fiscal
1999 was primarily attributable to

 o       a 52 increase in pc revenues due to strong sales of command  conquer

         of the sims in fiscal 2000

         tomorrow never dies as compared to fiscal 1999

 o       a 17 increase in al revenues  primarily  due to the shipment of titles

         due to its  acquisition by a third party in the first quarter of fiscal
         2000

         of n64 products

         the  success  of fifa  2000  tomorrow  never  dies and f1 2000  these
         increases were partially  offset by an expected decline in sales of n64

         devaluation of the euro in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999

license oem and other revenues

the  increase  in  license  oem and other  revenues  was  primarily  due to the
following

         titles in fiscal 2000

 o       other revenues decreased primarily due to decreases in 32bit products
         other  than  playstation  as we no  longer  publish  games  for  those
         platforms

costs and expenses  interest and other income net income taxes and net income
for both ea core and eacom segments

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues  decreased in
fiscal 2000 due to

 o       an  increase  in sales of higher  margin pc titles as a  percentage  of
         revenues

 o       an increase in sales of higher margin al copublished titles which make
         up a greater amount of total al revenues for fiscal 2000 as compared to
         fiscal 1999

 o       a decrease in sales of lower margin n64 titles

 o       higher average margin for pc sales due to higher percentage of revenues
         from internally developed and intellectual  property owned titles such
         as command  conquer tiberian sun simcity 3000 and the sims

 o       offset by a decrease  as a  percentage  of  revenues  of  playstation
         products

marketing and sales  marketing and sales expenses increased in absolute dollars
by 15 primarily attributed to

 o       increased  print  internet and  television  advertising to support new
         releases

 o       increased  cooperative  advertising  associated with higher revenues in
         north america and europe as compared to the prior year

 o       additional   headcount  related  to  the  continued  expansion  of  our
         worldwide distribution business

general and  administrative  general and  administrative  expenses increased in
absolute dollars by 21 primarily due to

 o       an increase in payroll and  occupancy  costs to support the increase in
         growth in north america and europe

 o       increased  general  and  administrative  spending  for  eacom  eacom
         expanded its staff and incurred additional administrative related costs
         required to support growth of the business

research and  development  the increase in absolute dollars by 28 for research
and development expenses excluding network development and support was due to

 o       increased  research  and  development   spending  due  to  the  ongoing
         investment  in our  online  business  eacom  increased  the number of
         online projects in development and increased development staff

 o       additional  headcountrelated  expenses  attributable  to the increased
         inhouse  development  capacity and a higher number of skus released in
         fiscal 2000

 o       an  increase  in  development  spending  for  next  generation  console
         products including development for the playstation 2 console

we released a total of 69 new  products in fiscal 2000  compared to 59 in fiscal
1999

network development and support the increase in network development and support
expenses was due to increased  eacom  spending  for network  infrastructure  in
preparation  for new online  products and the eacom game site in addition  we
incurred higher  infrastructure  costs related to increased  server capacity for
ultima online allowing eacom to serve a higher number of active subscribers

charge for acquired inprocess technology

fiscal 2000

 o       in connection  with the  acquisition  of kesmai by eacom in the fourth
         quarter of fiscal 2000  we allocated  and expensed  3869000  of the
         purchase price to acquired  inprocess  technology  kesmai had various
         projects  in  progress  at  the  time  of  the  acquisition  as of the
         acquisition  date  costs to complete  kesmai  projects  acquired  were
         expected to be  approximately  10550000  in future  periods  during
         fiscal 2001  some of these  development  projects  were  completed and
         launched on the eacom  gamesites  in addition  as certain  games are
         completed  we expect  resources to be  redirected to ongoing live game
         operations or to building the eacom publishing platform  as a result
         we do not anticipate incurring  significant future development costs in
         relation to these  projects  after fiscal 2002  we believe  there have
         been no significant changes to these estimates  we currently expect to
         complete the  development  of these  projects at various  dates through
         fiscal 2002 and to publish the projects upon completion in conjunction
         with the merger of kesmai we accrued approximately 200000 related to
         direct transaction and other related costs

 o       in connection with the acquisitions of two development  companies by ea
         core made in the 2nd and 4th quarters of fiscal 2000 we allocated and
         expensed  2670000  of the  purchase  price  to  acquired  inprocess
         technology

fiscal 1999

 o       in connection  with the acquisition of westwood by ea core in september
         1998 we allocated and expensed  41836000  of the purchase  price to
         acquired inprocess technology

 o       additionally  in  connection  with  the  acquisition  of two  software
         development  companies by ea core in the first quarter of fiscal 1999
         we  incurred  a total  charge of  2279000  for  acquired  inprocess
         technology

these charges were made after we concluded  that the  inprocess  technology had
not reached  technological  feasibility and had no alternative  future use after
taking into  consideration  the potential for usage of the software in different
products and resale of the software

amortization of intangibles  the amortization of intangibles  results primarily
from the acquisitions of westwood  kesmai  abc software and other acquisitions
made in fiscal 2000 amortization of intangibles was 10866000 for ea core and
1123000  for  eacom  in  fiscal  2000  for  fiscal  1999  amortization  of
intangibles was 5880000  resulting from the  acquisitions of westwood and abc
software by ea core

interest and other income  net  interest and other income  net  increased in
absolute  dollars  primarily  due to  realized  gains  on  sales  of  marketable
securities  and the sale of our  interest  in an  affiliate  those  gains  were
partially offset by a writeoff of a note receivable from an affiliate in fiscal
2000 as well as a gain on sale of land recognized in fiscal 1999

income  taxes  our  effective  tax rate was 310 for fiscal 2000 and 383 for
fiscal 1999  the  effective tax rate was lower than the  comparable  prior year
period  excluding  the  effect  of the  onetime  charges  in the  prior  year
primarily  as a result of a higher  portion of  international  income for fiscal
2000  subject to a lower  foreign tax rate as  compared  to the prior year  our
effective tax rate for fiscal 1999 was  negatively  affected as there was no tax
benefit recorded for a portion of the charges related to the acquired inprocess
technology  excluding the effect of these  charges  the effective tax rate for
fiscal 1999 would have been 320

                                       33
page

net income in absolute dollars  reported net income increased by 60 primarily
related to higher  revenues and gross  profits as compared to fiscal  1999  the
increase was also due to significant  onetime  charges for acquired  inprocess
technology in fiscal 1999 this was partially offset by higher costs incurred by
eacom  for the  development  of online  projects  the  network  infrastructure
development and higher infrastructure costs for ultima online and ultima online
the second age  excluding the onetime charges relating to acquired  inprocess
technology of  4512000  net of taxes  in fiscal 2000 net income would have
been   121263000   excluding  the  onetime  charges  relating  to  acquired
inprocess  technology of  37506000  net of taxes in fiscal 1999 net income
would have been 110378000

excluding  onetime  charges  related  to  acquired  inprocess  technology  and
goodwill amortization  net income would have been 129535000 for fiscal 2000

of sfas 133 and sfas 138 are  effective as of the beginning of the first quarter
of the fiscal year beginning after june 15 2000 the company is determining the
effect of sfas 133 137 and 138 on its financial statements

   in april  2001  the  emerging  issues  task force  issued no  0025  eitf
0025 accounting for consideration from a vendor to a retailer in connection
with the  purchase or promotion  of the  vendors  products  which states that
consideration  from a vendor to a reseller of the vendors  products is presumed
to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendors products and therefore
should be  characterized  as a  reduction  of  revenue  when  recognized  in the
vendors income  statement  that presumption is overcome and the  consideration
can be  categorized  as a cost incurred if and to the extent that a benefit is
or will be received from the recipient of the  consideration  that benefit must
meet certain conditions described in eitf 0025 the consensus should be applied
no later than in annual or interim  financial  statements for periods  beginning
after december 15 2001 the company is currently  evaluating the impact of this
consensus on its statement of operations



euro conversion

     on january 1 1999  eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european
union established fixed conversion rates between their existing  currencies the
legacy  currency and the one common legal currency known as the euro  from
january 1 1999  through june 30 2002 the  countries  will be able to use their
legacy  currencies  or the euro to transact  business  by july 1 2002  at the
latest  the  conversion  to the euro will be  complete at which time the legacy
currencies will no longer be legal tender  the fixed  conversion  rates between
their existing  currencies have  eliminated  exchange rate risk among the member
countries

     the conversion to the euro has reduced the number of forward contracts that
we use to hedge the exchange rate risk the forward  contracts that were used to
hedge the individual legacy currencies have been replaced by a single euro hedge
contract  and  the  intercompany  transactions  among  subsidiaries  within  the
european union are no longer subject to exchange rate risk

risk factors

         electronic  arts  business is subject to many risks and  uncertainties
which may affect our future financial performance some of those important risks
and  uncertainties  which may cause our  operating  results to vary or which may
materially and adversely affect our operating results are as follows

                   risk factors relating to our core business

platform  transitions such as the one now occurring typically depress the market
for video game software until new platforms achieve a wide market acceptance

     when new video game platforms are announced or introduced  into the market
consumers  typically reduce their purchases of video games for current platforms
in anticipation of new platforms being available  during that period  sales of
our video  game  products  can be  expected  to slow or even  decline  until new
platforms have achieved a wide market and consumer acceptance  we are currently
in such a transition  sony shipped its  playstation  2 product in japan  north
america  and  europe  in  calendar   year  2000   for  the  december   quarter
manufacturing  shortages  resulting  in the  delay of a  significant  number of
shipments of  playstation  2 units in north america and europe  have  adversely
affected our results of operations in addition nintendo announced that its new
console  system  nintendo  gamecube  will be released in calendar year 2001 in
japan and north america and in calendar year 2002 in europe microsoft announced
that its new console  system  xbox  will be released in calendar  year 2001 in
north america and japan and calendar  year 2002 in europe  delays in the launch
or  shortages  of these  platforms  could  also  adversely  affect  our sales of
products  for these  platforms  current  sales of our products for the existing
playstation  and  nintendo 64  platforms  have been  adversely  affected by the
pending  introduction of new platforms  we expect this trend to continue until
one or more of these new consoles achieve a wide installed base of consumers

new  video  game  platforms  create  additional  technical  and  business  model
uncertainties

     large  portions of our  revenues  are derived from the sale of products for
play on  proprietary  video game  platforms  such as the sony  playstation  the
success of our products is significantly affected by acceptance of the new video
game  hardware  systems and the life span of older  hardware  platforms  and our
ability to accurately predict which platforms will be most successful

     sometimes we will spend  development  and  marketing  resources on products
designed for new video game systems that have not yet achieved  large  installed
bases or will continue product development for older hardware platforms that may
have shorter life cycles than we expected  conversely if we do not develop for
a  platform  that  achieves   significant  market  acceptance   or  discontinue
development  for a platform  that has a longer  life cycle  than  expected  our
revenue growth may be adversely affected

     for example the sega dreamcast console launched in japan in early 1999 and
in the united  states in  september of 1999  we have  developed no products for
this platform  had this platform achieved wide market  acceptance  our revenue
growth would have been adversely affected  similarly  we released a variety of
products  for the new  sony  platform  the  playstation  2  the  shortages  of
playstation  2 units has  adversely  affected our results  and if that platform
does  not  achieve  wide   acceptance  by  consumers   we  will  have  spent  a
disproportionate  amount of our resources for this platform  similarly  we are
developing  products for the xbox and nintendo  gamecube  if these platforms do
not achieve wide  commercial  acceptance  our revenue  growth will be adversely
impacted

product  development  schedules are frequently  unreliable  and make  predicting
quarterly results difficult

     product development schedules  particularly for new hardware platforms and
highend multimedia personal computers or pcs are difficult to predict because
they involve creative processes  use of new development tools for new platforms
and  the  learning  process   research  and  experimentation   associated  with
development for new technologies  for example  the world is not enough for the
playstation  2 and emperor  battle for dune for the pc which were  expected to
ship in fiscal 2001 will not be released  until  fiscal 2002 due to  development
delays  additionally  development  risks for cdrom and dvd products can cause
particular   difficulties   in  predicting   quarterly   results  because  brief
manufacturing  lead times allow finalizing  products and projected release dates
late in a quarter  our revenues  and  earnings are  dependent on our ability to
meet our product  release  schedules  and our  failure to meet those  schedules
could result in revenues and earnings which fall short of analysts expectations
for any individual quarter and the fiscal year

                                       37

our business is both seasonal and cyclical

     our  business  is highly  seasonal  with a  significant  percentage  of our
revenues occurring in the december quarter  in our fiscal 2002 we expect these
seasonal  trends to be  magnified by general  industry  factors  including  the
current platform transition  anticipated fall launches of the xbox and nintendo
gamecube in north  america and the economic  slowdown in the united  states  in
addition  we are continuing to invest  significantly  in our online  operation
eacom  our business is also cyclical  video game platforms have  historically
had a life cycle of four to six years  and decline as more  advanced  platforms
are being introduced as one group of platforms is reaching the end of its cycle
and new  platforms  are  emerging  buying  patterns  may change  purchases  of
products  for  older  platforms  may slow at a  faster  rate  than  sales of new
platforms  we are currently in such a platform transition  sega introduced its
latest  platform in calendar  year 1999  and sony  shipped  its  playstation  2
console in japan  north  america  and europe in  calendar  year 2000  nintendo
announced that its new console system  nintendo  gamecube  will be released in
calendar  year 2001 in japan  and north  america  and in  calendar  year 2002 in
europe  microsoft announced that its new console system xbox will be released
in calendar year 2001  sales of our current  products for the current  nintendo
and sony  platforms  have already been  adversely  affected  and we expect this
trend to continue

the impact of ecommerce and online games on our business is not known

     while we do not currently derive significant  revenues from online sales of
our packaged  products  we believe that such form of distribution will become a
more significant factor in our business in the future ecommerce is becoming an
increasingly  popular method for conducting  business with  consumers  how that
form of distribution will affect the more traditional  retail  distribution  at
which we have historically had success and over what time period is uncertain
in addition we expect the number and popularity of online games to increase and
become a significant factor in the interactive games business  generally  we do
not know  how that  increase  generally  or the  emerging  business  of  eacom
specifically will affect the sales of packaged goods

our  business  our  products  and our  distribution  are subject to increasing
regulation in key territories

     legislation is increasingly  introduced which may affect the content of our
products and their distribution for example privacy rules in the united states
and europe impose  various  restrictions  on our web sites  those rules vary by
territory while of course the internet  recognizes no  geographical  boundaries
other countries such as germany have adopted laws regulating content transmitted
over the internet  that are stricter  than current  united  states laws  in the
united  states  in response  to recent  events  the federal and several  state
governments are considering content  restrictions on products such as those made
by us as well as restrictions on distribution of such products  any one or more
of these factors could harm our business

our platform  licensors are our chief  competitors  and  frequently  control the
manufacturing of our video game products

     our  agreements  with  hardware   licensors   which  are  also  our  chief
competitors  typically  give  significant  control  to the  licensor  over  the
approval  and  manufacturing  of our  products  this  fact  could  in  certain
circumstances  leave us unable to get our products  approved  manufactured and
shipped to customers  in most events control of the approval and manufacturing
process by the platform  licensors  increases both our manufacturing  lead times
and costs as compared to those we can achieve  independently  for  example  in
prior years we experienced delays in obtaining  approvals for and manufacturing
of  playstation  products which caused delays in shipping  those  products  the
potential for additional delay or refusal to approve or manufacture our products
continues with our platform licensors  such occurrences would harm our business
and  adversely  affect  our  financial  performance  additionally  we have not
negotiated  a publishing  agreement  with  nintendo  for the  nintendo  gamecube
platform  and we do not  know  whether  the  terms  of  this  agreement  will be
favorable

proliferation and assertion of patents poses serious risks to our business

     many  patents  have  been  issued  that  may  apply  to  widely  used  game
technologies  additionally many recently issued patents are now being asserted
against internet  implementations  of existing games  several such patents have
been  asserted  against  us such  claims can harm our  business  we will incur
substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims regardless
of the merits of the claims in the event that there is a determination  that we
have  infringed  a third  party  patent  we could  incur  significant  monetary
liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future

                  risk factors relating to our online business

because of eacoms limited operating history  it will be difficult to evaluate
its business and prospects

     eacoms  business is still in the  developing  stages  so evaluating  its
business and prospects  will be more difficult than would be the case for a more
mature business  we will continue to encounter the risks and difficulties faced
in  launching  a new  business  and we may  not  achieve  our  goals  or may be
compelled to change the manner in which we seek to develop the  business  these
uncertainties as to the future operations of eacom will increase the difficulty
we face in completing  and pursuing the essential  plans for the  development of
the  business  and will also make it more  difficult  for our  stockholders  and
securities analysts to predict the operating results of this business

eacom has a history of losses and expects to  continue to incur  losses and may
never achieve profitability

     eacom has  incurred  substantial  losses to date  including  the  current
fiscal  year  we expect  eacom to continue to incur  losses as it develops its
business  eacom will be required to maintain the significant support  service
and product  enhancement  demands of online users and we cannot be certain that
eacom will produce  sufficient  revenues  from its  operations to support these
costs  even if profitability is achieved  eacom may not be able to sustain it
over a period of time

our agreements  with america online may not prove  successful to the development
of eacoms business

      we have a  series  of  agreements  with  america  online  aol  for the
offering of our games for online  play  these  agreements  require that we make
substantial  guaranteed  payments to aol and that we commit our resources to the
pursuit  of  the  online  game  opportunity  we  cannot  be  assured  that  the
substantial  costs  associated  with the aol agreements will be justified by the
revenues generated from that relationship in addition restrictions included in
the aol agreements  limiting  other channels we may develop for offering  online
games may limit our ability to diversify our online distribution strategies the
success for us of the aol agreements will also be a result of aols  performance
under the agreements a factor over which we will have very little control

we have very limited experience with online games and may not be able to operate
this business effectively

     offering  games solely for online play is a substantial  departure from our
traditional  business  of selling  packaged  software  games  we have  employed
various  pricing  models  including  subscription  fees pay to play fees and
advertising  we have very little  experience  with  developing  optimal pricing
strategies  for online games and no  experience  in pay to play  pricing or in
securing   advertising   revenues  for  online  services   similarly   we  are
inexperienced  in  predicting  usage  patterns  for our  games  because  of our
inexperience in this area we may not be effective in achieving success that may
otherwise be attainable from offering our games online

online games have risks that are not associated with our traditional business

     online  games   particularly  multiplayer  games  pose  risks  to  player
enjoyment that do not generally apply to packaged game sales players frequently
would not be  acquainted  with other  players  which may  adversely  affect the
playing  experience  social issues raised by a players  conduct may impact the
experience  for other players  we have not  determined  whether or how we might
monitor  or  proctor  player  behavior  that  impairs  the game  experience  in
addition  there  are  substantial  technical  challenges  to be met both in the
introduction  of our games online and in  maintaining  an effective game playing
environment over time  also  hacking and spamming has become a serious problem
for online sites and significant hacking and spamming could seriously interfere
with  online  game play  if these  risks are not  successfully  controlled  and
technical  challenges  resolved  potential  customers  for  our  games  may  be
unwilling  to play in  sufficient  volume  to  allow  us to  attain  or  sustain
profitability

we may not be able to obtain the required licenses to offer our games online

     if we are unable to reach terms with certain  licensors  for our games  we
will  not be able to  offer  certain  of our  games  for  online  play  many of
electronic arts most popular games feature  characters  trademarks  people or
concepts for which we have licenses from third  parties  as an example  our ea
sports products  typically  contain content  licensed from a sports and players
association in certain instances the terms of these licenses will not allow us
to offer the games for online play without negotiating an additional license we
cannot be certain  that the  licensors  will be amenable to a license for online
games  involving  their  content or  even if they are  that we will be able to
reach  terms  with  them for such use  we may be forced to agree to terms  that
ultimately materially impair the economic value to us of the online game market

proliferation  and  assertion of patents  poses serious risks to the business of
eacom

     many  patents  have been  issued  that may apply to  widely  used  internet
technologies  additionally many recently issued patents are now being asserted
against internet  implementations  of older  technologies  several such patents
have been asserted against us such claims can harm our business  we will incur
substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims regardless
of the merits of the claims in the event that there is a determination  that we
have  infringed  a third  party  patent  we could  incur  significant  monetary
liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future

development of eacoms business will require significant capital and we cannot
be assured that it will be available

     eacom will not be successful  if it does not receive the very  substantial
financing  that will be required to develop its  business  electronic  arts has
agreed to provide a limited  amount of funding  to  eacom  but this  financing
alone may not be  sufficient  for the  development  of  eacoms  business  any
additional funding that is obtained from ea may either be treated as a revolving
credit  advance  or  would  increase  eas  retained   interest  in  eacom  and
correspondingly  decrease the interest of the holders of  outstanding  shares of
class b common stock the attraction of additional  equity or debt financing for
eacom  from third  parties may not be possible or may only be possible on terms
that result in significant  dilution to class a and class b common  stockholders
or interest or other costs and debtrelated restrictions on the operation of the
business  to date  nearly all funding except warrants and cash from revenues
has been provided by ea

if use of the internet  does not  continue to develop and  reliably  support the
demands placed on it by electronic commerce eacoms business will be harmed

     eacoms success depends upon growth in the use of the internet as a medium
for playing games the use of the internet for sophisticated  games like ours is
relatively new our business would be seriously harmed if

    o    use of the internet  does not  continue to increase or  increases  more
         slowly than expected

    o    the infrastructure for the internet does not effectively support online
         game play

    o    concerns over the secure transmission of confidential  information over
         public  networks  inhibit  the  growth  of the  internet  as a means of
         conducting commercial transactions or

    o    government  regulations  regarding  internet content  privacy or other
         conditions impede the effectiveness of the internet to users

capacity  restraints  may  restrict  the use of the internet as a forum for game
play resulting in decreased demand for our products

     the internet  infrastructure  may not be able to support the demands placed
on it by increased  usage or the limited  capacity of networks to transmit large
amounts of data  other risks  associated  with  commercial  use of the internet
could slow its growth including

    o    outages and other delays  resulting from the inadequate  reliability of
         the network infrastructure

    o    slow development of enabling  technologies and complementary  products
         and

    o    limited availability of costeffective high speed access

     delays  in the  development  or  adoption  of new  equipment  standards  or
protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity or increased
governmental  regulation  would cause the  internet  to fail to gain  or lose
viability as a means of game playing if these or any other factors cause use of
the internet for commerce to slow or decline  the internet may not prove viable
as a commercial marketplace this in turn would result in decreased demand for
eacoms products and services

to become and remain competitive eacom must continually develop and expand new
content this is inherently risky and expensive

     eacoms  success  depends on our ability to develop  products and services
for the eacom  site and our ability to  continually  expand the content on that
site  our  agreement  with aol  requires  us to  develop  new  games  under our
relationship  with aol we cannot  assure you that products will be developed on
time in a cost effective manner or that they will be successful

we may not be able to respond to rapid technological change

     the market for internet  products and  services is  characterized  by rapid
technological  change and evolving  industry  standards  both in completing the
design and implementation of our network infrastructure and thereafter  we will
be  required to  continually  improve  performance  features  reliability  and
capacity of our  network  infrastructure  we cannot  assure you that we will be
successful  in  responding  rapidly  or  in a  cost  effective  manner  to  such
developments

increasing  governmental  regulation of the internet  could limit the market for
our products

     as internet commerce continues to evolve we expect that federal state and
foreign governments will adopt laws and regulations covering issues such as user
privacy  taxation of goods and services  provided over the  internet  pricing
content and quality of products and services  it is possible  that  legislation
could expose companies involved in electronic commerce to liability taxation or
other  increased  costs  any of which  could  limit the  growth  of  electronic
commerce  generally  legislation  could dampen the growth in internet usage and
decrease its acceptance as a communications  and commercial  medium if enacted
these laws and regulations could limit the market for eacoms products

our  revenues  have been  heavily  dependent  on a single  product  and would be
adversely affected if that products popularity were to decline

     in the near term  eacoms  revenues to date have  consisted  primarily of
revenues  from  sales  of our  online  product  ultima  online  and we would be
adversely  affected if revenues from that product were to decline for any reason
and not be  replaced  we expect the online game  market to become  increasingly
competitive  and it is possible that other  producers  current or future games
could cause our revenue from ultima online to decline  in addition  popularity
of ultima online could decline over time simply  because of consumer  preference
for new game experiences

we invest very heavily in research and  development  and network  technology and
operations  for eacom  and we cannot be assured that we will achieve  revenues
that validate this level of spending

      we have  invested  and  expect to  continue  to invest  very  heavily in
research and development  and network  technology and operations for our website
and online games we will need to expand eacoms revenues  substantially for it
to achieve profitability with these levels of expenditure being required and we
may not be able to do so if we cannot increase  revenues to profitable  levels
the  value of eacom  will be  impaired  in order to  develop  the  broad  game
offerings  that we envision  for our online  operations  it will be necessary to
engage in significant  developmental  efforts both to adapt existing ea games to
the  online  format  and to create new online  games  our  agreements  with aol
require us to maintain a substantial  commitment to online game  development and
we  cannot  be  assured  that we  will  realize  acceptable  returns  from  this
investment

online  product  development   schedules  are  unreliable  and  make  predicting
quarterly results difficult

     online product development schedules particularly for internet based games
are difficult to predict  because they involve  creative  processes  use of new
development  tools  internet  latency  issues  a  learning  process  to better
understand  internet  based game  mechanics  and research  and  experimentation
associated  with   development  for  new  online   technologies   additionally
development risks for internet based products can cause particular  difficulties
in predicting  quarterly results because of the challenges  associated with game
testing live beta testing  integration into network servers and integration on
to the games web site and may impact the release  go live  dates of products
during a particular quarter several online products currently under development
are experiencing development delays and will be released later than planned our
revenues and  operating  costs are  dependent on our ability to meet our product
go live  schedules  and our failure to meet those  schedules  could result in
revenues falling short of analysts expectations with no corresponding decrease
in expenses resulting in increased operating losses for eacom

                              general risk factors


because of the intense competition for qualified technical  creative marketing
and other  personnel  we may not be able to attract  and  retain the  personnel
necessary for our businesses

     the market for technical creative marketing and other personnel essential
to the  development  of online  businesses and management of our online and core
businesses  continues  to be  extremely  competitive  and we may not be able to
attract and retain the employees we need  in addition  the cost of real estate
in the san  francisco  bay area  the location of our  headquarters  and largest
studio has increased dramatically  and has made recruiting from other areas and
relocating   employees  to  our  headquarters  more  difficult   if  we  cannot
successfully  recruit and retain the  employees we need  our ability to develop
and manage our businesses will be impaired

foreign sales and currency fluctuations

     for the twelve  months  ended march 31  2001  international  net  revenues
comprised  37 of total  consolidated  net  revenues  for the fiscal year ended
march 31 2000  international net revenues  comprised 40 of total  consolidated
net revenues  we expect  foreign sales to continue to account for a significant
and  growing  portion  of our  revenues  such sales are  subject to  unexpected
regulatory requirements tariffs and other barriers additionally foreign sales
are  primarily  made in local  currencies  which may  fluctuate  while we hedge
against foreign currency fluctuations we cannot control translation issues for
example  our  european  revenues  in fiscal 2001 were  adversely  impacted by a
devaluation  of the euro and british  pound as  compared to the prior year  the
devaluation had an adverse effect for the year on our sales and net income  any
of these factors may significantly harm our business

increased difficulties in forecasting results

      during platform transition  periods  where the success of our products is
significantly impacted by the changing market for our products  forecasting our
revenues and earnings is more  difficult  than in more stable or rising  product
markets the demand for our products may decline during a transition faster than
we anticipate  negatively impacting both revenues and earnings at launch sony
shipped  only  half of the  number  of  playstation  2 units to  retail in north
america than it had originally planned and it shipped significantly fewer units
than  planned at launch in europe as well  shortages  were  announced  as being
caused by shortages of components for manufacturing due to these shortages our
results  of   operations   for  fiscal  2001  have  been   adversely   affected
consequently  depending  on  the  number  and  the  timing  of  units  actually
available  these  shortages  may  adversely  impact our sales of  playstation 2
products in fiscal 2002

we cannot  predict the impact of recent  actions and comments by the  securities
and exchange commission sec and fasb

     recent  actions and comments  from the sec have focused on the integrity of
financial  reporting  in  addition  the fasb and other  regulatory  accounting
agencies have recently introduced several new or proposed accounting  standards
some of which represent a significant  change from current  industry  practices
for example in december 1999 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 101
revenue recognition in financial  statements sab 101 provides guidance on the
recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements of
all public  registrants  in  response  to numerous  requests  for  interpretive
guidance of sab 101 the effective  date of the standard has been delayed twice
sab 101 became  effective  during the first quarter of fiscal 2001  sab 101 did
not have a  material  effect  on the  underlying  strength  or  weakness  of our
consolidated  business operations as measured by the dollar value of our product
shipments and cash flows

fluctuations in stock price

      due to analysts  expectations of continued growth and other factors  any
shortfall in earnings could have an immediate and significant  adverse effect on
the trading  price of our common stock in any given  period  as a result of the
factors discussed in this report and other factors that may arise in the future
the market price of our common stock  historically  has been and we expect will
continue to be subject to significant fluctuations over a short period of time
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us to changes in analysts
earnings estimates  or to factors affecting the computer  software  internet
entertainment  media or  electronics  businesses or the  securities  markets in
general for example  during fiscal year 2001 the price per share of our class
a common stock ranged from 2659 to 5613


                                       42
page

because of these and other factors affecting our operating results and financial
condition  past  financial  performance  should  not be  considered  a reliable
indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends
to anticipate results or trends in future periods

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk


market risk

we are  exposed  to  various  market  risks  including  the  changes in foreign
currency  exchange rates and interest  rates  market risk is the potential loss
arising from changes in market rates and prices foreign exchange contracts used
to hedge foreign  currency  exposures and shortterm  investments are subject to
market risk we do not consider our cash and cash  equivalents  to be subject to
interest  rate  risk  due  to  their  short  maturities  we do not  enter  into
derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes

foreign currency exchange rate risk

we utilize foreign  exchange  contracts to hedge foreign  currency  exposures of
underlying assets and liabilities  primarily certain  intercompany  receivables
that are denominated in foreign  currencies  thereby  limiting our risk gains
and losses on foreign exchange  contracts are reflected in the income statement
at march 31 2001 we had foreign  exchange  contracts  all with  maturities of
less than nine months to purchase and sell approximately 279415000 in foreign
currencies primarily british pounds european currency units euro canadian
dollars japanese yen and other currencies

fair value  represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate
and the forward rate the  counterparties to these contracts are substantial and
creditworthy   multinational   commercial   banks  the  risks  of  counterparty
nonperformance  associated  with  these  contracts  are  not  considered  to  be
material  notwithstanding  our efforts to manage foreign exchange risks  there
can be no assurances  that our hedging  activities  will  adequately  protect us
against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations

while the  contract  amounts  provide  one  measurement  of the  volume of these
transactions  they do not  represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk
the amounts arising from the possible inabilities of counterparties to meet the
terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts if any by which
the counterparties obligations exceed our obligations as these contracts can be
settled on a net basis at our  option  we control  credit risk  through  credit
approvals limits and monitoring procedures

interest rate risk

our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily
to our investment  portfolio  we do not use derivative financial instruments in
our  investment  portfolio  we manage our interest rate risk by  maintaining an
investment  portfolio  primarily  consisting of debt  instruments of high credit
quality and  relatively  short average  maturities  we also manage our interest
rate risk by maintaining  sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that
we are typically able to hold our  investments  to maturity  at march 31 2001
