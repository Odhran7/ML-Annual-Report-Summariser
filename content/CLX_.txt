sources and availability of raw materials 

the company purchases raw materials from numerous unaffiliated us and international suppliers some of which are sole source or singlesource suppliers interruptions in the delivery of these materials could adversely impact the company key raw materials used by the company include resin nonwoven fabrics for wipes products sodium hypochlorite corrugated cardboard soybean oil solvent derivatives of amines and other chemicals and agricultural commodities while sufficient raw materials were generally available during fiscal year 2022 supply constraints and commodity costs increases for certain raw materials and finished goods were experienced this is due to supply chain disruptions combined with increased demand as the economy reopened as the world moves into a new phase of the pandemic as well as unfavorable geopolitical and weather events experienced the company expects continued volatility and increased cost pressures in both commodities and transportation to continue in fiscal year 2023 

the company generally utilizes supply contracts to help ensure availability and a number of forwardpurchase contracts to help reduce the volatility of the pricing of raw materials needed in its operations however the company is highly exposed to changes in the prices of commodities and transportation used in manufacturing and shipping of its products for further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in exhibit 991 “risk factors – volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials 

    

energy transportation labor and other necessary supplies or services have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the company’s net earnings and cash flow” and “risk factors – supply chain issues can result in product shortages or disruptions to the company’s business” in item 1a 

patents and trademarks 

most of the company’s brand name consumer products are protected by registered trademarks the company’s brand names and trademarks are highly important to its business and the company vigorously protects its trademarks from apparent infringements maintenance of brand equity value is critical to the company’s success the company’s patent rights are also material to its business and are asserted where appropriate against apparent infringements

competition 

the markets for consumer products are highly competitive the company’s products compete with other nationally advertised brands and with “private label” brands within each category competition comes from similar and alternative products some of which are produced and marketed by major multinational or national companies having financial resources greater than those of the company in addition the company faces competition from retailers including club stores grocery stores drugstores dollar stores mass merchandisers ecommerce retailers and subscription services furthermore heightened competitive activity is expected as inflation continues to increase consumers experience reduced purchasing power and the company implements pricing to offset higher costs the company’s products generally compete on the basis of product performance brand reputation and recognition image and price a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising support if a product gains consumer acceptance it typically requires continued advertising and promotional support and ongoing product innovation to maintain its relative market position for further information regarding the intense competition the company faces see “risk factors – the company faces intense competition in its markets which could lead to reduced net sales net earnings and cash flow” in item 1a

inclusion and diversity 

people are critical to our efforts to drive growth and deliver value for shareholders one of the ways we put people at the center is by continuing to work toward a more inclusive and diverse workplace because we believe diverse backgrounds experiences and perspectives create stronger teams unlock more innovation and – ultimately – contribute to greater success both individually and collectively 

our inclusion and diversity id strategy development and execution is led by our chief diversity and social impact officer who joined the company in july 2022 is a member of the clorox executive committee and reports to our chief executive officer our id committee is chaired by our chief operating officer id metrics are included in the corporate scorecard regularly reviewed by the board reflecting our view that advancing id is essential to our longterm business success many employees and task forces across different communities functions and geographies support this work 

we annually conduct pay equity analyses as part of our regular compensation cycle for our nonproduction teammates partnering with a thirdparty labor economist to review potential discrepancies our goal is for each employee to be compensated fairly irrespective of race ethnicity and gender 

over a dozen employee resource groups ergs reflect the diverse demographics of our workforce and are intended to create a sense of belonging for our employees through community education and awareness which helps attract and retain diverse talent and deepen our understanding of our diverse consumer base we believe that these ergs also create value for our business by amplifying both employee and consumer voices 

in fiscal year 2022 we were included in forbes’ 2022 america’s best employers for diversity list ranking eighth out of 500 companies clorox was also included in the 2022 bloomberg gender equality index which measures gender equality across the pillars of female leadership and talent pipeline equal pay and gender pay parity inclusive culture sexual harassment policies and prowomen brand

hiring and development 

we look to attract and retain the best talent to deliver against our strategy and commitments we prioritize career growth and leadership development because growing our talent and building our capabilities supports retention and helps us establish a strong foundation for longterm success our investments include a suite of training and education for people managers to help them become effective coaches and leaders mentoring programs and initiatives to help build a pipeline of diverse talent our summer internship coop and fulltime equivalent fte rotational programs for college hires in addition we partner with our ergs and establish partnerships with external organizations that work to advance equity and opportunity for the communities they represent we also conduct a robust talent review and leader succession planning process to ensure a strong pipeline for key roles 

as the pandemic evolves and we move to new ways of working we have anchored to a set of core beliefs in making decisions there’s value in being together  some of the time the future of work is hybrid and the clorox experience must be good for our people and our business these beliefs influenced the design of the hybrid work experience we implemented in fiscal year 2022 

employee engagement and retention 

we employ an ongoing listening strategy which includes both annual and more frequent pulse surveys we also survey our employees on their engagement to gauge their perception of the company as a place to work as well as their views of leadership understanding of our ignite strategy and sense of inclusion in fiscal year 2022 our employee engagement was 82 which was in line with the 50 th percentile for fortune 500 and industry benchmarks 2  our engagement score declined by 5 as compared to fiscal year 2021 which is similar to engagement and retention trends across our and other industries the employee engagement surveys are part of our continuous improvement mindset around building a culture at clorox that is both engaging and aligned to our purpose values and ignite strategylike many companies we have experienced elevated turnover in fiscal year 2022 in order to retain top talent we regularly assess retention risk and employee sentiment through the employee engagement survey and other channels and develop and execute related action plans 

employee safety and wellbeing 

as a health and wellness company the company takes a holistic approach to caring for our employees with benefits and programs designed to support physical mental and financial wellbeing 

our focus on safety is an example of how we put people at the center we support that pledge through a combination of education training and related policies while also operating in compliance with applicable regulations including occupational safety and health administration osha guidelines in the us in fiscal year 2022 the company’s reportable incident rate rir was 056 this was significantly lower than the 31 average rir for goodsproducing manufacturing companies in 2020 which is the latest available data from the us bureau of labor statistics 3  

recognizing the prolonged effects of the pandemic the company has increasingly focused on supporting our people’s mental health we expanded our sick time policy to explicitly include mental wellbeing and launched a partnership with a new global employee assistance program partner that enables coverage across all regions we continue to provide parents with support such as paid parental leave adoption resources and subsidized childcare and have announced we will offer enhanced familyforming benefits beginning in january 2023 

to support our people’s financial wellbeing the company provides competitive compensation – including short and longterm incentives – to attract and retain top talent in addition we support our employees’ retirement readiness by offering thirdparty financial planning services and a 401k plan that is above market relative to the industry average with the company contributing up to 10 of an employee’s annual salary 

societal wellbeing 

in fiscal year 2022 the clorox company foundation created a signature theme of health security based on the belief that health and wellness is a basic human right the foundation now focuses on programs in three areas to address this signature theme community wellness disease prevention and disaster relief and preparedness using this framework our foundation further brings our purpose to life as we champion people to be well and thrive every single day 

2 employee engagement surveys may vary across companies on a yeartoyear basis 

3 our fiscal year 2022 rir of 056 means that for every 100 fulltime equivalent clorox employees globally we averaged less than one reportable incident during the past year the criteria used to determine rir follows the us department of labor’s osha guidelines and is applied globally 

    

additionally we provide cash grants including matching employee donations and product donations while also implementing cause marketing programs to support our communities on important matters including health and safety education and racial justice 

finally to activate the foundation’s new community wellness focus the company launched the healthy parks project to address environmental justice and provide better access to green spaces in underserved communities in the projects first year the company will support parks organizations where it has large employee bases – starting in oakland california – benefiting the health of local communities

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties set forth below as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report or in other filings by the company with the sec could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the company or that are not currently believed by the company to be material may also harm the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

business and industry risks 

the changing retail environment and changing consumer preferences could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s sales are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery mass retail outlet warehouse club and dollar store channels in addition to ecommerce channels as the covid19 pandemic conditions change we cannot predict how the retail environment will evolve or whether there will continue to be a greater consumer emphasis on health and wellness alternative retail channels including hard discounters subscription services and buying clubs have become and may continue to be more prevalent and popular than traditional retailers in addition a growing number of alternative sales channels and business models such as niche brands native online brands private label and store brands directtoconsumer brands and channels and discounter channels have emerged in the markets we serve driven in part by the covid19 pandemic in particular the growing presence of and increasing sales through ecommerce retailers have affected and may continue to affect consumer behavior or preferences as consumers increasingly shop online and via mobile and social applications and market dynamics including any pricing pressures for consumer goods as retailers face added costs to build their ecommerce capacity these trends have been magnified due to the covid19 pandemic in many of our geographies further consumer preferences continue to evolve due to a number of factors including fragmentation of the consumer market and changes in consumer demographics which includes the aging of the general population and the emergence of millennial and younger generations who have different spending consumption and purchasing habits evolving consumer concerns or perceptions regarding esg practices of manufacturers including the sourcing and sustainability of packaging materials such as singleuse plastics a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredients evolving consumer concerns or perceptions whether accurate or inaccurate regarding the effects of ingredients or substances present in certain consumer products changing consumer sentiment toward nonlocal products or sources and changing perceptions of environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management if we are not successful in continuing to adapt to changing consumer preferences and market dynamics or expanding sales through ecommerce retailers or alternative retail channels our 

    

business financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted in addition ecommerce and alternative retail channels may create significant pricing pressures for consumer goods presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases in all of the channels into which the company sells if these ecommerce and alternative retail channels were to take significant market share away from traditional retailers andor the company is not successful in these channels or business models our margins and results of operations may be materially and negatively impacted 

sales growth objectives may be difficult to achieve the company may not be able to successfully implement price increases and market and category declines and changes to the company’s product and geographic mix may adversely impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

a large percentage of the company’s revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition during fiscal year 2022 84 of the company’s net sales were attributable to us markets including us territories the company’s ability to achieve sales growth depends on its ability to drive growth through innovation including as part of its ignite strategy expand into new products and categories channels and countries invest in its established brands and enhanced merchandising grow categories with retailers and capture market share from competitors the company’s ability to achieve sales growth also depends on foreign currency fluctuations a weakening of foreign currencies in which sales are generated relative to the company’s reporting currency us dollars would decrease net sales the company has implemented price increases and may implement additional price increases in the future which may slow sales growth or create volume declines in the short term as customers and consumers adjust to these price increases in addition our competitors may or may not take competitive actions which may lead to sales declines and loss of market share if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product innovations undertake sales marketing and advertising initiatives that grow its product categories andor develop acquire or successfully launch new products or brands it may not achieve its sales growth objectives furthermore a general decline in the markets for certain product categories has had and may in the future have a negative impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations in addition changes to the mix of products that the company sells as well as the mix of countries in which its products are sold may adversely impact the company’s net sales profitability and cash flow 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and related impacts has had and could continue to have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic including the emergence of variants for which vaccines may not be effective may negatively affect our business by causing or contributing to among other things 

• significant disruptions in our business operations and in the ability of significant thirdparty vendors manufacturing and other business or commercial partners including customers to meet their obligations to us 

• significant decrease or volatility in sales of or demand for our primary products due to among other things any decreased demand for cleaning and disinfecting products as covid19 restrictions continue to lift and we transition from a pandemic to endemic state closure or reduced operating hours of our key customers consumer inability to purchase our products due to personal illness or government implemented restrictions and any resulting changes in consumer preference and reduced availability of certain products as we prioritize the production of other products due to changes in demand 

• worldwide regional and local adverse economic and financial market conditions including increased risk of inflation fluctuations in commodities packaging transportation and other input costs increased unemployment decreased disposable income declining consumer confidence or economic slowdowns or recessions in any of our major markets all of which could impact the manufacturing operations of the company or our thirdparty partners 

• significant us or international governmental actions or other limitations or restrictions including restrictions on the ability of our employees suppliers customers or thirdparty partners to travel or perform necessary business functions or our ability to manufacture ship distribute market or sell our products and 

• adverse impacts on our supply chain including manufacturing by the company or thirdparty partners due to raw material packaging or other supply shortages labor shortages or reduced availability of air or other commercial transport port congestion and closures although we are unable to predict the impact on our ability to source materials in the future we expect these and other supply chain pressures to continue into the coming year 

in addition sustained labor shortages or increased turnover rates within our employee base caused by covid19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors could lead to increased costs such as increased wage rates to attract and retain employees and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing and distribution facilities and overall business the actions we take in response to any improvements in conditions related to covid19 such as our returntooffice plans 

    

may also vary widely by geography and will likely be made with incomplete information and may prove to be premature incorrect or insufficient and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

furthermore we have experienced and could continue to experience higher costs in certain areas as a result of covid19 which may continue increase or become necessary in these or other areas even as efforts to contain the pandemic have made progress and some restrictions have relaxed new variants of the virus are causing additional outbreaks the extent of covid19’s effect on our operational and financial performance in the future will depend on future developments including the duration spread and intensity of the pandemic our continued ability to manufacture and distribute our products any future government actions affecting consumers our business operations including any vaccine mandates and the economy generally changing economic conditions and any resulting inflationary impacts as well as timing and effectiveness of global vaccines all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape such impacts could materially adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the company faces intense competition in its markets which could lead to reduced net sales net earnings and cash flow 

the company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the us and in its international markets most of the company’s products compete with other widely advertised promoted and merchandised brands within each product category the company also faces competition from retailers including club stores grocery stores drugstores dollar stores mass merchandisers ecommerce retailers and subscription services which are increasingly offering “private label” brands that are typically sold at lower prices and compete with the company’s products in certain categories increased purchases of “private label” products or other lower cost priced brands could negatively impact net sales of the company’s highermargin products or there could be a shift in product mix to lowermargin offerings especially at a time of rising inflation and this would negatively impact our margins the company’s products generally compete on the basis of product performance brand reputation and recognition image and price advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have significant impacts on consumer purchasing decisions and the company is increasingly using digital media marketing and promotional programs to reach consumers a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it typically requires continued advertising promotional support and product innovations to maintain its relative market position if the company’s advertising marketing and promotional programs including its use of digital and social media to reach consumers are not effective or adequate the company’s net sales may be negatively impacted 

some of the company’s competitors are larger than the company and have greater financial resources these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the company can heightened competitive activity from strong local competitors other large multinational companies and new entrants into the market may result in more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges increased promotional spending and geographic expansion and marketing of new disinfecting products furthermore the company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the company competitive activity may require the company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions andor reduce prices which could lead to reduced sales margins andor net earnings 

unfavorable general economic and political conditions beyond our control could negatively impact our financial results 

general economic factors that are beyond our control have materially adversely affected and could continue to materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity these factors include but are not limited to recent supply chain disruptions labor shortages wage pressures rising inflation and potential economic slowdown or recession as well as housing markets consumer credit availability consumer debt levels fuel and energy costs for example the price of gasoline interest rates tax rates and policy unemployment trends the impact of natural disasters pandemics civil disturbances and terrorist activities foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations conditions affecting the retail environment for products sold by us and other matters that influence consumer spending and preferences 

other financial uncertainties in our major markets and unstable geopolitical conditions in certain markets including civil unrest and governmental changes could undermine global consumer confidence and reduce consumers’ purchasing power thereby reducing demand for our products restrictions on our ability to transfer earnings or capital across borders price controls limitations on profits retaliatory tariffs import authorization requirements and other restrictions on business activities which have been or may be imposed or expanded as a result of political and economic instability deterioration of economic relations between countries or otherwise could impact our profitability in addition us trade sanctions against countries designated by the us government as state sponsors of terrorism andor financial institutions accepting transactions for commerce within such countries could increase significantly which could make it impossible for us to continue to make sales to customers in such countries the imposition of retaliatory sanctions against us multinational corporations by countries that are or may become 

    

subject to us trade sanctions or the delisting of our branded products by retailers in various countries in reaction to us trade sanctions or other governmental action or policy could also negatively affect our business 

in february 2022 russia invaded ukraine although we recently suspended our cat litter distribution business in russia amounting to fiscal year 2021 net sales of 7 million in march 2022 we have experienced and expect to continue to experience the indirect impacts of the conflict in ukraine including increases in the cost of raw and packaging materials and commodities including the price of oil supply chain and logistics challenges and foreign currency volatility and it is not possible to predict the broader or longerterm consequences of this conflict or the sanctions imposed to date 

dependence on key customers could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the company’s net sales net sales to the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates were 25 of consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended june 30 2022 2021 and 2020 and occurred across all of the company’s reportable segments the company’s five largest customers accounted for nearly half of the company’s consolidated net sales for each of the fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 and a significant portion of the company’s future revenues may continue to be derived from a small number of customers as a result changes in the strategies of the company’s largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry a shift of shelf space to “private label” or competitors’ products or a decision to lower pricing of consumer products including branded products may harm the company’s net sales or margins and reduce the ability of the company to offer new innovative products to consumers in addition the use of the latest technology by our customers regarding pricing may lead to category pricing pressures consistent with the ongoing variability in information technology systems industrywide our information technology platforms may not be fully compatible at all times with those used by our customers therefore it may or may not have an impact on our ability to respond to customer demands specific to data or technology furthermore any loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in net sales to a key customer even if such loss or reduction relates to a key customer of a business unit of the company could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders and the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its customers accordingly customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the company at any time and for any reason if the company does not effectively respond to the demands of its customers they could decrease their purchases from the company causing the company’s net sales and net earnings to decline furthermore unfavorable market conditions or competitive pressures may cause the company’s customers to reevaluate the number and mix of brands they sell resulting in lower purchases of the company’s products by these customers we regularly review the financial strength of our key customers and where appropriate modify customer credit limits which may have an adverse impact on future sales 

with the growing trend towards retailer consolidation both in the us and internationally the continued growth of ecommerce and the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers we are increasingly dependent on certain retailers this trend which has been magnified due to the covid19 pandemic has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailers who have in the past changed and may in the future change their business strategies demand lower pricing or higher trade discounts or impose other burdensome requirements on product suppliers or move away from branded products to “private label” these large consolidated companies could also exert additional competitive pressure on the company’s other customers which could in turn lead to such customers demanding lower pricing higher trade discounts or special packaging or imposing other onerous requirements on the company if the company ceases doing business with a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease due to customer inventory reductions or otherwise the company’s business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

loss of or inability to attract key personnel could adversely impact the company’s business 

the company’s success depends in part on its continuing ability to identify hire develop and retain highly qualified and diverse personnel the labor market for these employees is very competitive and wages and compensation costs continue to increase our ability to attract and retain talent has been and may continue to be impacted by challenges in the labor market particularly in the us which is experiencing wage inflation sustained labor shortages a shift toward remote work and the effects of covid19 we compete to attract talent within and outside of our industry for high demand skills that are scarce in key geographic areas such as the san francisco bay area the company’s ability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future has been and may continue to be impacted by the labor market related activities to identify hire and onboard qualified talent at increasing compensation costs may require significant time and expense which could further adversely affect the company’s operations and financial results the company’s success also depends on its ability to retain its key personnel including its executive officers and senior management team and to continue to implement its succession plans for senior management and other key employees the unexpected loss or unavailability of one or more of the company’s key leaders could disrupt its business 

    

in addition labor costs in the us are rising and our industry is experiencing a shortage of workers labor is one of the primary components in the cost of operating our business if we face labor shortages and increased labor costs as a result of increased competition for employees higher employee turnover rates increases in employee benefits costs or labor union organizing efforts our operating expenses could increase and our growth and results of operations could be adversely impacted labor shortages higher employee turnover rates and labor union organizing efforts could also lead to disruptions in our business we may be unable to increase prices of our products in order to pass future increased labor costs onto our customers in which case our margins would be negatively affected additionally if we increase product prices to cover increased labor costs the higher prices could adversely affect sales volumes 

harm to the company’s reputation or the reputation of one or more of its leading brands or products could have an adverse effect on the business financial condition and results of operations 

maintaining a strong reputation with consumers customers and trade and other third party partners is critical to the success of the company’s business the company devotes significant time and resources to training programs relating to among other things ethics compliance and product safety and quality as well as sustainability goals and has published esg goals including relating to environmental impact and sustainability and inclusion and diversity as part of its ignite strategy despite these efforts or if the company is not successful in achieving its goals provides materially inaccurate information or receives negative publicity about the company including relating to product safety quality efficacy esg or similar issues whether real or perceived could occur in addition the company’s products could face withdrawal recall or other quality issues which could lead to decreased demand for and reputational damage to the related brands in particular the company’s dietary supplement and related products are highly dependent on consumers’ perception of the efficacy safety and quality of our products and may be supported by only a limited number of conclusive clinical studies newly published clinical studies and emerging studies could prove or allege that ingredients in our dietary supplement products or the products themselves or similar products of other companies are ineffective or harmful to consumers the company also licenses certain of its brands to third parties and with the increase in demand for public disinfecting and cleaning products due to the covid19 pandemic the company has increased and may continue to increase its focus on partnering with or licensing its intellectual property to companies in industries involving shared space and may partner with other companies to provide disinfecting products and cleaning education and protocols and to leverage its related brands such licenses and partnerships may create additional exposure for those brands to product safety quality sustainability and other concerns 

widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the accessibility and speed of dissemination of information negative publicity posts or comments about the company its brands its products its marketing activities whether accurate or inaccurate or disclosure of nonpublic sensitive information about the company could be widely disseminated through the use of social media or in other formats additionally marketing initiatives may not have the desired effect on a brand’s or product’s image such events if they were to occur could harm the company’s image and adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations as well as require resources to rebuild the company’s reputation 

the company may not successfully introduce new products and line extensions or expand into adjacent categories and countries which could adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s future performance and growth depends on innovation and its ability to successfully develop or license capabilities to introduce new products brands line extensions and product innovations or enter into or expand into adjacent product categories sales channels or countries the company’s ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and quickly innovate in order to adapt its products to meet changing consumer demands is essential especially in light of the reduction in barriers for even small competitors to quickly introduce new brands and products directly to consumers that ecommerce permits this risk is further heightened by the continued evolution of consumer needs habits and preferences as a result of shifts in us demographics reflecting various factors including cultural and socioeconomic changes the company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve its innovation goals new product development and marketing efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience not only incur substantial capital expenditures but also contain inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays which could result in the company not being first to market and the failure of new products brands and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance if product introductions are not successful costs associated with these efforts may not be fully recouped and the company’s net earnings could be adversely affected in addition if sales generated by new products cause a decline in sales of the company’s existing products the company’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

    

acquisitions new venture investments and divestitures may not be successful which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with the company’s strategy the company expects to continue to seek acquisition joint venture and investment opportunities however the company may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic transactions at attractive prices in addition an increase in regulatory restrictions or continued market volatility could hinder the company’s ability to execute strategic business activities including any acquisitions or investments furthermore all acquisitions and investments entail numerous risks including risks relating to the company’s ability to 

• successfully integrate acquired companies brands products technologies systems or personnel into the company’s existing business operations in an effective timely and cost efficient manner 

• maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies throughout acquired companies including effective integration of acquired companies into the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

• successfully enter categories markets and business models in which the company may have limited or no prior experience 

• achieve expected synergies and obtain the desired financial or strategic benefits from acquisitions within the anticipated time periods if at all 

• achieve distribution expansion related to products categories and markets from acquisition and retain key relationships and or personnel of acquired companies 

• identify and manage any legal or reputational risks that may predate or be associated with a transaction which could negatively impact the company following the consummation of such transaction and 

• manage other unanticipated problems or liabilities 

acquired companies or operations joint ventures or investments may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability and cash flow expectations furthermore acquisitions or ventures could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt the assumption of contingent liabilities such as those relating to advertising claims environmental issues and litigation negative reputational issues an increase in expenses related to intangible assets including trademarks and goodwill and increased operating expenses all of which could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would subject the company to local regulations and could potentially lead to risks related to among other things increased exposure to foreign exchange rate changes tax or labor laws government price control repatriation of profits and liabilities relating to the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” in addition to the extent that the economic benefits associated with an acquisition or investment diminish in the future or the performance of an acquired company or business is less robust than expected we may be required to record impairments of intangible assets including trademarks and goodwill any impairment charges could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

the company has divested and may in the future divest certain assets businesses or brands with respect to any potential future divestiture the company may encounter difficulty finding potential acquirers or other divestiture options on favorable terms any future divestiture could affect the profitability of the company as a result of the gains or losses on such sale of a business or brand the loss of the operating income or sales resulting from such sale or the costs or liabilities that are not assumed by the acquirer that may negatively impact profitability and cash flow subsequent to any divestiture the company may also be required to recognize impairment charges or other losses as a result of a divestiture 

in addition any potential future acquisitions new ventures or divestitures may divert the attention of management and resources from other business priorities the occurrence of any of these risks or uncertainties may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships could adversely affect our business reputation financial condition and results of operations 

we enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships such as relationships in connection with the codevelopment of products or devices or promotion and sales relationships with companies in industries operating in public spaces these relationships may not generate the level of sales we anticipate when entering into the relationship or may otherwise adversely impact our business reputation financial condition and results of operations furthermore such relationships have and in the future could create additional exposure to litigation investigations disputes or other proceedings as well as product safety quality sustainability and other concerns 

    

operational risks 

volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials energy transportation labor and other necessary supplies or services have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the company’s net earnings and cash flow 

volatility and increases in the cost of raw materials including resin nonwoven fabrics for wipes products sodium hypochlorite corrugated cardboard soybean oil solvent derivatives of amines and other chemicals and agricultural commodities and rapid increases in the cost of energy transportation labor and other necessary supplies or services have harmed and are likely to continue to harm the company’s results of operations significant inflationary pressures have impacted our gross margin in fiscal year 2022 and we expect inflationary pressures to continue into fiscal year 2023 we have also experienced and may continue to experience disruption in our manufacturing operations and supply chain many of the raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors including market conditions inflation supplier capacity restraints geopolitical developments including the ongoing conflict in ukraine changes in supply and demand weather conditions including the potential effects of climate change fire natural disasters growing and harvesting conditions energy costs health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks including covid19 labor shortages currency fluctuations governmental actions including import and export requirements such as new or increased tariffs sanctions quotas or trade barriers port congestions or delays transport capacity restraints cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites acts of terrorism and other factors beyond our control certain raw materials supplies and other goods and services have been impacted by the covid19 pandemic and inflationary pressures and although we are unable to predict the impact to our ability to source such materials and services in the future we expect these supply pressures and market disruptions to continue into fiscal year 2023 

if such cost pressures occur or exceed the company’s estimates and the company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases its margins would be harmed in addition even if the company increases the prices of its products in response to increases in the cost of commodities or other cost increases it may not be able to sustain its price increases sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or customers may decide not to pay the higher prices which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share and the company’s projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations 

to reduce the cost volatility associated with anticipated purchases of certain commodities the company uses derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps the extent of the company’s derivative position at any given time depends on the company’s assessment of the markets for these commodities the cost volatility in the markets and the cost of the derivative instruments many of the commodities used by the company in its products do not have actively traded derivative instruments if the company does not or is unable to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if it executes a position and costs subsequently decrease the company’s costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than its competitors’ costs and the company’s financial results could be adversely affected for further information regarding the company’s use of derivative instruments see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in exhibit 991 

supply chain issues can result in product shortages or disruptions to the company’s business 

the company has a complex global network of suppliers that has expanded to meet increased customer demand and may in the future further evolve in response to market conditions the company also relies on a number of solesource and singlesource suppliers for certain commodities and raw material inputs including packaging product components finished products and other necessary supplies the company has experienced and could continue to experience material disruptions in production and other supply chain issues including as a result of supply chain dependencies which could result in outofstock conditions and its results of operations and relationships with customers could be adversely affected if new or existing suppliers are unable to meet any standards set by the company government or industry regulations or the company’s customers if the company is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity quality and price levels needed for its business if any of the company’s key suppliers becomes insolvent ceases or significantly reduces its operations or experiences financial distress or if any environmental economic or other outside factors impact its operations the company also requires new and existing suppliers to meet its ethical and business partner standards and if our existing or new suppliers fail to meet such standards or if we are unable to contract with suppliers on favorable terms our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected suppliers may also have to meet governmental and industry standards and any relevant standards required by the company’s customers which may require additional investment and time on behalf of suppliers and the company in addition the company may increase production inhouse and reduce its supply and manufacturing arrangements with third parties which may lead to additional costs connected to such transition and unwinding of certain manufacturing relationships 

    

the company experienced significantly elevated demand for disinfecting products and other consumer and professional products during the height of the covid19 pandemic as compared to prepandemic levels this increase caused strain on the company’s supply chain network and its ability to meet such demand due to the loss or disruption to the timely availability of adequate supplies of raw materials and finished goods that the company requires for the manufacture of its products disruptions and shortages in transportation and logistics operations and restriction of or disruption in its manufacturing and distribution capacity among other things if demand were to increase again in a similar manner the company may be unable to fully or substantially meet demand which could result in among other things shortages in the companys products unmet consumer demand leading to reduced preference for the company’s products in the future customers purchasing products from the company’s competitors as a result of such shortage of products strained customer relationships termination of customer contracts additional competition and new entrants into the market and loss of potential sales and revenue which could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or a failure of key information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations and reputation 

to conduct its business the company relies extensively on information technology systems many of which are managed hosted provided andor used by thirdparties and their vendors these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to communicating within the company and with customers consumers vendors investors and other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products receiving and processing purchase orders and shipping products to customers processing transactions storing processing and transmitting data including personal confidential information and payment card industry data hosting processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research business and financial information and complying with financial reporting regulatory legal and tax requirements furthermore the company sells certain of its natural personal care products vitamins minerals supplements and other products directly to consumers online and through websites mobile apps and connected devices and the company also engages in online activities including promotions rebates and customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information through the use of any of these information technology systems or processes the company or its vendors have in the past and could in the future again experience cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or other incidents that may result in unauthorized access disclosure and misuse of consumer customer employee vendor or company information especially as the company shifts to a hybrid working model under which employees will continue accessing its technology infrastructure remotely 

in addition to upgrading the company’s enterprise resource planning system it also uses various hardware software and operating systems that may need to be upgraded or replaced in the near future as such systems cease to be supported by thirdparty service providers and may be vulnerable to increased risks including the risk of security breaches system failures and disruptions any such upgrade could take time oversight and be costly to the company if such systems are not successfully upgraded or replaced in a timely manner system outages disruptions or delays or other issues may arise if a new system does not function properly or is not adequately supported by thirdparty service providers and processes it could adversely affect the company’s business and operations which in turn adversely impact the company’s results of operations and cash flows 

despite the security measures the company has in place the information technology systems including those of our customers vendors suppliers and other thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted have in the past and may in the future be vulnerable to cyberthreats such as computer viruses or other malicious codes security breaches unauthorized access phishing attacks and other disruptions from employee error unauthorized uses system failures including internet outages unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors or cyberattacks by hackers criminal groups nationstates and nationstatesponsored organizations and socialactivist organizations the company’s information technology systems and its thirdparty providers’ systems have been and will likely continue to be subject to cyberthreats such as computer viruses or other malicious codes ransomware unauthorized access attempts business email compromise cyber extortion denial of service attacks phishing social engineering hacking and other cyberattacks attempting to exploit vulnerabilities the company has seen and may continue to see an increase in the number of such attacks as the company shifts to a hybrid working model under which employees will continue working remotely and accessing its technology infrastructure remotely in addition while we have purchased cybersecurity insurance costs related to a cyberattack may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or be excluded under the terms of our cybersecurity policy as cyberattacks increase in frequency and magnitude we may be unable to obtain cybersecurity insurance in amounts and on terms we view as appropriate for our operations 

to date the company is not aware that its business or operations have been materially impacted by these attacks however the company’s security efforts and the efforts of its thirdparty providers may not prevent or timely detect attacks and resulting breaches or breakdowns of the company’s or its thirdparty service providers’ databases or systems in addition if the company or its thirdparty providers are unable to effectively resolve such breaches or breakdowns on a timely basis the company may experience interruptions in its ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm governmental fines penalties regulatory proceedings and litigation and remediation expenses in addition such incidents could result in 

    

unauthorized disclosure and misuse of material confidential information including personal information cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated are constantly evolving and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives and this increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them we have incurred and will continue to incur expenses to comply with privacy and data protection standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards and contractual obligations increased regulation of data collection use and retention practices including selfregulation and industry standards changes in existing laws and regulations including reporting requirements enactment of new laws and regulations increased enforcement activity and changes in interpretation of laws could increase our cost of compliance and operation limit our ability to grow our business or otherwise harm our business 

in addition data breaches or theft of personal information collected by the company and its thirdparty service providers as well as company information and assets have occurred in the past and may occur in the future the company is subject to the laws and regulations of various countries where it operates or does business related to solicitation collection processing transferring storing or use of consumer customer vendor or employee information or related data including the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which went into effect in may 2018 and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” which went into effect in january 2020 these laws and regulations change frequently and new legislation continues to be introduced and may be interpreted and applied differently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements for example the california privacy rights act “cpra” which was effective on january 1 2022 modifies the ccpa significantly several other states have introduced or passed similar legislation to the ccpa and cpra which may impose varying standards and requirements on our data collection use and processing activities the changes introduced by data privacy and protection regulations increase the complexity of regulations enacted to protect business and personal data and they subject the company to additional costs and have required and may in the future require costly changes to the company’s security systems policies procedures and practices these laws and regulations also may result in the company incurring additional expenses and liabilities in the event of unauthorized access to or disclosure of personal data 

a breach or other breakdown in the company’s technology including a cyberattack privacy breach data breach or other incident involving the company or any of the companys thirdparty service providers or vendors that results in unauthorized disclosure or significant unavailability of business financial personal or stakeholder information could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations in addition if the company’s service providers suppliers or customers experience a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in the company’s supply chain or reduced customer orders or other business operations which would adversely affect the company 

these risks also may be present to the extent any of our partners distributors joint venture partners or suppliers using separate information systems not integrated with the information systems of the company suffers a cybersecurity incident and could result in increased costs related to our involvement in investigations or notifications conducted by these third parties these risks may also be present to the extent a business we have acquired that does not use our information systems experiences a system shutdown service disruption or cybersecurity incident due to the conflict in ukraine there is a possibility that the escalation of tensions could result in cyberattacks that could either directly or indirectly affect our operations 

in addition we are in the process of a multiyear phased upgrade to our digital and productivity capabilities including replacing our enterprise resource planning system to enhance operating efficiencies and provide more effective management of our business operations the upgrade poses several challenges including training of personnel migration of data and the potential instability of the new system if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the upgraded technology infrastructure or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this enhancement or it does not operate as designed our business could be adversely affected 

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations and international trade 

in fiscal year 2022 16 of the company’s net sales were attributable to international markets the company faces and will continue to face substantial risks associated with its foreign operations including but not limited to 

• changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets including as a result of inflation volatile commodity prices and increases in the cost of raw and packaging materials labor energy and logistics which could impact the manufacturing operations of the company and our thirdparty partners 

• global or local economic or political instability geopolitical events environmental events civil unrest work stoppages labor disputes or widespread health emergencies such as covid19 or other pandemics or epidemics 

• foreign currency fluctuations including devaluations currency controls and inflation which may adversely affect the company’s ability to do business in certain markets and reduce the us dollar value of revenues profits or cash flows it generates in nonus markets 

    

• continued high levels of inflation in argentina which have required and may continue to require the company to record gains and losses in net earnings to reflect the remeasurement of the companys non‐us dollar monetary assets and liabilities of argentina 

• difficulty in obtaining nonlocal currency eg us dollars to pay for the raw materials needed to manufacture the company’s products and contractmanufactured products 

• the imposition of tariffs trade restrictions price profit or other government controls labor laws immigration restrictions travel restrictions including as a result of covid19 or other pandemics or epidemics import and export laws or other government actions generating a negative impact on the company’s business including changes in trade policies that may be implemented and the impact of geopolitical events generally 

• potential disruption from wars and military conflicts including the conflict in ukraine terrorism kidnapping and drug‐related or other types of violence 

• employment litigation related to employees contractors and suppliers particularly in argentina 

• potential loss of distribution channels as a result of retailer consolidation 

• increased credit risk of customers suppliers and distributors and defaults on obligations of foreign governments 

• potential harm to third parties the company’s employees andor surrounding communities and related liabilities and damages to the company’s reputation from the use storage and transportation of chlorine in certain international markets where chlorine is used in the production of bleach whether such actions are undertaken by the company or by the company’s business partners 

• lack of wellestablished or reliable and impartial legal systems in certain countries where the company operates including difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights 

• challenges relating to enforcement of or compliance with local laws and regulations and with us laws affecting operations outside of the us including without limitation the fcpa 

• continuing legal political and economic uncertainty and disruption from the united kingdom’s exit from the european union including the longterm impact of the bilateral trade and cooperation deal governing the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union and 

• the possibility of nationalization expropriation of assets or other similar government actions 

all of the foregoing risks could have a significant adverse impact on the company’s ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations the company’s small sales volume in some countries relative to some multinational and local competitors could exacerbate such risks

legal and regulatory risks 

government regulations could impose material costs 

generally the manufacture processing formulation packaging labeling storage distribution advertising and sale of the company’s products and the conduct of its business operations must comply with extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations for example in the us many of the company’s products are regulated by the environmental protection agency the food and drug administration including applicable current good manufacturing practice regulations andor the consumer product safety commission and the company’s product claims and advertising are regulated by the federal trade commission among other regulatory agencies additionally the company’s and its suppliers’ manufacturing and distribution operations are also subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies the company’s international operations are also subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products there is also an increased risk of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and related difficulties in maintaining effective internal controls additionally the company could be subject to future inquiries or investigations by governmental and other regulatory bodies any determination that the company’s operations or activities are not in compliance with applicable law could expose the company to future 

    

impairment charges or significant fines penalties or other sanctions that may result in a reduction in net income or otherwise adversely impact the business and reputation of the company 

fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties may also impact the company’s effective tax rate and the company’s results of operations and changes in tax laws including additional guidance issued by the us treasury department or the us internal revenue service could create uncertainty impact our recorded liability in future periods and have a material impact on the company’s results of operations 

in particular because of the company’s extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations or allegations of violations of the fcpa and similar international antibribery laws these antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls policies and procedures that mandate compliance with these laws will protect us from reckless intentional or unintentional criminal acts committed by our employees jointventure partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business financial condition and results of operations 

federal state and foreign governments may introduce new or expand existing legislation and regulations or courts or governmental authorities could impose more stringent interpretations of existing legislation and regulations affecting the company’s operations which may require the company to increase its resources capabilities and expertise in certain areas for example the company is subject to regulations regarding the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment including as a result of evolving climate change standards and regulations in other areas such as with respect to “conflict minerals” and subject to increased costs or mandatory funding or financial support for recycling and waste management programs under extended producer responsibility regulation or laws such regulations could negatively impact the company’s ability to obtain raw materials or could increase its acquisition and compliance costs or cause the company to contribute funds to recycling and other waste management infrastructure thus making our products more costly less competitive than other competitive products or reduce consumer demand furthermore additional or amended legislation in the areas of esg disclosure including the sec’s proposal on climate change disclosure healthcare reform sustainability of packaging including plastic packaging executive compensation and corporate governance could also increase the company’s costs the company is also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the us and other jurisdictions including the gdpr the ccpa and the cpra which have and could continue to subject the company to additional compliance costs 

if the company is found to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas it could be subject to governmental or regulatory actions including fines import detentions injunctions product withdrawals or recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations particularly with respect to its charcoal business could delay or prevent the company from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations in addition the company markets and sells products that are subject to regulations relating to dietary supplements in order to comply with any changes in these laws and regulations including any changes that result from newly published clinical studies and emerging studies that may assert or prove that ingredients in our products or our products themselves are ineffective or harmful to consumers the company may be required to make changes to product formulation labeling or marketing claims perform additional testing to substantiate its product claims make costly changes in its manufacturing processes or supply chain or stop selling certain products until corrective actions have been taken any of these developments could increase the company’s costs significantly which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

esg issues including those related to climate change and sustainability may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation 

companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their esg policies increased focus and activism related to esg may hinder the company’s access to capital as investors may reconsider their capital investment as a result of their assessment of the company’s esg practices in particular customers consumers investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental issues including climate change water use deforestation plastic waste and other sustainability concerns changing consumer preferences may also result in increased demands regarding plastics and packaging materials including singleuse and nonrecyclable plastic packaging and other components of our products and their environmental impact on sustainability a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredients or increased consumer concerns or perceptions whether accurate or inaccurate regarding the effects of ingredients or substances present in certain consumer products these demands could impact the profitability of some of our products cause us to incur additional costs to make changes to our operations or to make additional commitments set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them which could expose us to market operational and execution costs or risks in addition governmental and nongovernmental organizations investors customers consumers our employees and other stakeholders have placed 

    

increasing importance on esg matters and depending on their assessment of our esg practices certain investors may reconsider their investment in the company 

concern over climate change or plastics and packaging materials in particular may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment increased regulatory requirements including in relation to various aspects of esg including sec’s recent disclosure proposal on climate change or environmental causes may result in increased compliance or input costs of energy raw materials or compliance with emissions standards which may cause disruptions in the manufacture of our products or an increase in operating costs we may undertake additional costs to control assess and report on esg metrics as the nature scope and complexity of esg reporting diligence and disclosure requirements expand our ability to achieve any stated goal target or objective is subject to numerous factors and conditions many of which are outside of our control any failure to achieve our esg goals or a perception whether or not valid of our failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to new or changes in legal or regulatory requirements concerning environmental or other esg matters or increased operating or manufacturing costs due to increased regulation or environmental causes could adversely affect our business and reputation 

if the company does not adapt to or comply with new regulations or fails to meet the esg goals under its ignite strategy or evolving investor industry or stakeholder expectations and standards or if the company is perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for esg issues customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from another company or a competitor and the company’s reputation business or financial condition may be adversely affected

environmental matters create potential liabilities that could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to air emissions water discharges handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances and climate change the company has incurred and will continue to incur significant expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations and such expenditures reduce the cash flow available to the company for other purposes 

    

the company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its current and former facilities in addition some of its present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many years and over that time some of those facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that those sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom the company has sent waste may be identified and become the subject of remediation in addition the company also handles andor transports hazardous substances including but not limited to chlorine at some of its international production facilities a release of such chemicals whether in transit or at the company’s facilities due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability and business disruptions the company could also become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future whether as a result of new laws and regulations or otherwise that could result in a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations

failure to effectively utilize successfully assert or successfully defend the company’s intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness if the company is found to have infringed the intellectual property of rights or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights its competitiveness could be negatively impacted 

the company relies on intellectual property rights based on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its brands products packaging for its products inventions and confidential information there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions and product innovations the company cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be invalidated circumvented or challenged and the company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert its intellectual property rights or to defend those rights from assertions of invalidity in addition even if such rights are obtained in the us the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us it is also possible that the company’s brands may not be available for use in certain countries due to prior third party rights thereby limiting expansion of the company’s brands the company also licenses certain of its brands to third parties and has increased its focus on licensing its intellectual property in connection with the codevelopment of products or devices or promotion and sales relationships with companies in industries operating in public spaces if other parties infringe the company’s intellectual property rights they may dilute or diminish the value of the company’s brands and products in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the company’s brands and harm its net sales the failure to perfect and protect its intellectual property rights could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition if the company is found to have violated the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of thirdparty marks ideas or technologies such a finding could result in the need to cease use of such trademark trade secret copyrighted work or patented invention in the company’s business as well as the obligation to pay for past infringement if holders are willing to permit the company to continue to use such intellectual property rights they could require a payment of a substantial amount for continued use of those rights either ceasing use or paying such amounts could cause the company to become less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations even if the company is not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights the company could incur material legal costs and related expenses to defend against such claims of infringement and the company could incur significant costs associated with suspending its use of the challenged intellectual property rights even if it is ultimately found not to have infringed such rights 

the company’s business could be negatively impacted as a result of stockholder activism or an unsolicited takeover proposal or a proxy contest 

in recent years proxy contests and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies during fiscal years 2012 and 2011 the company was the target of an unsolicited takeover proposal from a stockholder activist which resulted in significant costs to the company if such a proposal were to be made again the company would likely incur significant costs which could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

    

stockholder activists may also seek to involve themselves in the governance strategic direction and operations of the company through stockholder proposals or otherwise such proposals may disrupt the company’s business and divert the attention of the company’s management and employees and any perceived uncertainties as to the company’s future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities the perception that the company needs a change in the direction of its business or the perception that the company is unstable or lacks continuity which may be exploited by our competitors cause concern to our current or potential customers and make it more difficult for the company to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners which could adversely affect the company’s business in addition actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business 

our amended and restated bylaws designate specific courts as the exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a judicial forum of their choice for disputes with us 

our amended and restated bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the state courts of delaware or if no state court has jurisdiction the federal district court of the district of delaware will to the fullest extent permitted by law be the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions or proceedings under delaware statutory or common law the choice of forum provision in our bylaws does not waive our compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder moreover the provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the exchange act or by the securities act 

our exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum of such stockholders’ choice for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees which may discourage such lawsuits even though an action if successful might benefit our stockholders if a court were to find our exclusive forum provision either to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions all of which may increase our costs of litigation any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of our amended and restated bylaws described in the preceding sentences 

financial and economic risks 

profitability and cash flow could suffer if the company is unable to generate anticipated cost savings successfully implement its strategies or efficiently manage supply chain and manufacturing processes 

the company continues to implement plans to improve its competitive position by setting aggressive annual cost savings targets intended to reduce material costs and manufacturing inefficiencies and realize productivity gains distribution and logistical efficiencies and overhead reductions if the company cannot successfully implement its cost savings plans the company may not realize all anticipated benefits which could adversely affect its longterm strategies the company also continues to seek to penetrate new markets and introduce new products and product innovations these goals and strategies may not be implemented or may fail to achieve the desired results the company may also not be able to successfully implement any future price increases which may negatively affect our profitability and cash flow and any such price increases may also negatively affect sales volumes in addition the company expects to continue to restructure its operations as necessary to improve operational efficiency including occasionally opening or closing offices facilities or plants gaining additional efficiencies may become increasin gly difficult over time there may be onetime and other costs and negative impacts on sales growth relating to facility or plant closures or other restructurings and anticipated cost savings and the company’s strategies may not be implemented or may fail to achieve desired results if the company is unable to generate anticipated cost savings successfully implement its strategies implement new pricing efficiently manage its supply chain and manufacturing processes if we are ineffective or slow in developing and implementing appropriate transformational initiatives including the recently announced upgrade to our digital and productivity capabi lities or if we are unable to achieve anticipated results and cost savings from the recently announced implementation of the streamlined operating model the company’s results of operations could suffer these plans and strategies could also have a negative impact on the company’s relationships w ith employees or customers which could also adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the estimates and assumptions on which the company’s financial projections are based may prove to be inaccurate which may cause its actual results to materially differ from such projections which may adversely affect the company’s future profitability cash flows and stock price 

the company’s financial projections including any sales or earnings guidance or outlook it may provide from time to time are dependent on certain estimates and assumptions related to among other things category growth development and launch of innovative new products market share projections product pricing and sale volume and product mix foreign exchange rates and volatility tax rates commodity prices distribution cost savings accruals for estimated liabilities including litigation reserves measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans and the company’s ability to 

    

generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in its existing business fund internal growth repurchase its stock make acquisitions pay dividends and meet debt obligations the company’s financial projections are based on historical experience and on various other estimates and assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made and the company’s actual results may differ materially from its financial projections especially in light of the increased difficulty in making such estimates and assumptions as a result of the covid19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions any material variation between the company’s financial projections and its actual results may adversely affect the company’s future profitability cash flows and stock price 

increases in the estimated fair value of the procter  gamble co “pg’s” interest in the company’s glad business increase the value of the company’s obligation to purchase pg’s interest in the glad business upon the termination of the venture agreement and may in the future adversely affect the company’s net earnings and cash flow 

in january 2003 the company entered into a venture agreement with pg related to the company’s glad bags and wraps business in connection with this agreement pg provides research and development support to the glad business the agreement with pg expires in january 2026 unless the parties agree to extend the term the agreement requires the company to purchase pg’s 20 interest at the expiration of its term for cash at fair value as established by predetermined valuation procedures as of june 30 2022 2021 and 2020 the estimated fair value of pg’s interest was 635 million 613 million and 610 million respectively of which 468 million 432 million and 400 million respectively has been recognized by the company and is reflected in other liabilities in the company’s consolidated balance sheets the difference between the estimated fair value and the amount recognized and any future changes in the fair value of pg’s interest is charged to cost of products sold in accordance with the effective interest method over the remaining life of the agreement the estimated fair value of pg’s interest which has increased significantly over the past several years increased by 155 million from june 30 2017 to june 30 2022 primarily as a result of the enactment of hr1 also known as the “tax cuts and jobs act” the “tax act” and the extension of the venture agreement with and the related research and development support provided by pg and may continue to change up until any such purchase by the company of pg’s interest the key assumptions and estimates used to arrive at the estimated fair value include but are not limited to tax rates the rate at which future cash flows are discounted discount rate commodity prices future volume estimates net sales and expense growth rates changes in working capital capital expenditures foreign exchange rates inflation and terminal growth rates any changes in such assumptions or estimates could significantly affect such estimated fair value and accordingly the value of the company’s repurchase obligation and may adversely affect the company’s net earnings up until any such purchase and cash flow at the time of any such purchase for additional information see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements in exhibit 991 

the company’s indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations and prevent the company from fulfilling its financial obligations and the company may not be able to maintain its current credit ratings may not continue to pay dividends or repurchase its stock and may not remain in compliance with existing debt covenants 

as of june 30 2022 the company had nearly 3 billion of debt the company’s indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

• require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness which would reduce the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital requirements capital expenditures future acquisitions dividends repurchase the company’s common stock and for other general corporate purposes 

• limit the company’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to general adverse economic conditions or changes in its business and the industries in which it operates 

• place the company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt and 

• limit along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the company’s debt documents its ability to borrow additional funds 

the company may also incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions repurchase stock or fund other activities for general business purposes in addition on december 31 2021 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority the governing body regulating the london interbank offered rate libor ceased publishing certain libor reference rates borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate derived from the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” which is a relatively new reference rate and has a very limited history the future performance of sofr cannot be predicted based on its limited historical performance since the initial publication of sofr in april 2018 changes in sofr have on occasion been more volatile than changes in other benchmark or market rates such as united states dollar libor additionally any successor rate to sofr under our revolving credit facility may not have the same 

    

characteristics as sofr or libor as a result the amount of interest we may pay on our revolving credit facility is difficult to predict 

further certain terms of the agreements governing the company’s overthecounter derivative instruments contain provisions that require the company’s credit ratings assigned by standard  poor’s and moody’s to the company to remain at investmentgrade or above as of june 30 2022 the company’s standard  poor’s and moody’s ratings were both investmentgrade however if these credit ratings were to fall below investmentgrade the counterparties to the derivative instruments in net liability positions could request full collateralization and it may negatively impact the company’s other financial arrangements including the supply chain financing arrangement offered by a financial institution to our suppliers which could in turn impact our working capital 

the company has historically declared and paid quarterly cash dividends on its common stock and has been authorized to repurchase its stock subject to certain limitations under its stock repurchase programs any determinations by the board of directors to continue to declare and pay cash dividends on the company’s common stock or to repurchase the company’s common stock however will be based on a number of factors including the board of directors’ continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration and payment of dividends are in the best interests of the company’s stockholders in the event the company does not declare and pay a quarterly dividend or discontinues its stock repurchases the company’s stock price could be adversely affected

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties set forth below as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report or in other filings by the company with the sec could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the company or that are not currently believed by the company to be material may also harm the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

business and industry risks 

the company faces intense competition in its markets which could lead to reduced net sales net earnings and cash flow 

the company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the us and in its international markets most of the company’s products compete with other widely advertised promoted and merchandised brands within each product category the company also faces competition from retailers including club stores grocery stores drugstores dollar stores mass merchandisers ecommerce retailers and subscription services which are increasingly offering “private label” brands that are typically sold at lower prices and compete with the company’s products in certain categories increased purchases of “private label” products or other lower cost priced brands could reduce net sales of the company’s highermargin products or there could be a shift in product mix to lowermargin offerings which would negatively impact our margins the company’s products generally compete on the basis of product performance brand reputation and recognition image and price advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have significant impacts on consumer purchasing decisions and the company is increasingly using digital media marketing and promotional programs to reach consumers a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it typically requires continued advertising promotional support and product innovations to maintain its relative market position if the company’s advertising marketing and promotional programs including its use of digital media to reach consumers are not effective or adequate the company’s net sales may be negatively impacted 

some of the company’s competitors are larger than the company and have greater financial resources these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the company can in addition as the company currently experiences elevated demand for many of its products especially its disinfecting products it expects continued heightened competitive activity from strong local competitors other large multinational companies and new entrants into the market in many of its categories especially the disinfecting category the company expects such activities to include more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges increased promotional spending and geographic expansion and marketing of new disinfecting products it expects promotional activities to increase as retailers try aggressively to get consumers back into their stores after prolonged “stay at home” and other government restrictions continue to ease furthermore the company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the company competitive activity may require the company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions andor reduce prices which could lead to reduced sales margins andor net earnings 

the changing retail environment and changing consumer preferences could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s sales are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery mass retail outlet warehouse club and dollar store channels in addition to ecommerce channels however the retail environment continues to evolve and may change to a more significant extent or at a faster pace in light of the covid19 pandemic with a greater consumer emphasis on health and wellness and this could significantly change the way traditional retailers do business alternative retail channels including hard discounters subscription services and buying clubs have become more prevalent and popular in addition a growing number of alternative sales channels and business models such as niche brands native online brands private label and store brands directtoconsumer brands and channels and discounter channels have emerged in the markets we serve in particular the growing presence of and increasing sales through ecommerce retailers have affected and may continue to affect consumer preferences as consumers increasingly shop online including in response to the covid19 pandemic and market dynamics including any pricing pressures for consumer goods as retailers face added costs to build their ecommerce capacity these trends have been magnified due to the covid19 pandemic in many of our geographies further consumer preferences continue to evolve due to a number of factors including fragmentation of the consumer market and changes in consumer demographics which includes the aging of the general population and the emergence of millennial and younger generations who have different spending consumption and purchasing habits evolving consumer concerns or perceptions regarding esg practices of manufacturers including the sourcing and sustainability of packaging materials such as singleuse plastics a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredients evolving consumer concerns or perceptions whether accurate or inaccurate regarding the effects of ingredients or substances present in certain consumer products and changing consumer sentiment toward nonlocal products or sources if we are not successful in continuing to adapt to changing consumer preferences and market dynamics or expanding sales through ecommerce retailers or alternative retail channels our business financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted in addition ecommerce and alternative retail channels may create significant pricing pressures for consumer goods presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases in all of the channels into which the company sells if these ecommerce and 

    

alternative retail channels were to take significant market share away from traditional retailers andor the company is not successful in these channels or business models our margins and results of operations may be materially and negatively impacted 

the currently evolving situation related to the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic including the emergence of variants for which vaccines may not be effective may negatively affect our business by causing or contributing to among other things 

• significant disruptions in our business operations and in the ability of significant thirdparty vendors manufacturing and other business or commercial partners including customers to meet obligations to us 

• significant decrease or volatility in sales of or demand for our significant products due to among other things closure or reduced operating hours of our key customers consumer inability to purchase our products due to prolonged inventory shortages illness or government implemented restrictions and any resulting changes in consumer preference reduced availability of certain products as we prioritize the production of other products due to increased demand decreased future demand due to recent customer or consumer stockpiling of products or increased consumer mobility as other government restrictions continue to ease  any negative reputational impact resulting from our new partnerships in industries involving shared space or an adverse perception of our pandemic response perceived price gouging effected or product recommendations made by third parties that we do not control changes in retailer or distributor restocking or fulfillment practices or worldwide regional and local adverse economic and financial market conditions including increased risk of inflation 

• significant us or international governmental actions or other limitations or restrictions including restrictions on the ability of our employees suppliers customers or thirdparty partners to travel or perform necessary business functions or our ability to manufacture ship distribute market or sell our products 

in addition we have experienced higher costs in certain areas as a result of covid19 such as transportation and logistics and production employee compensation as well as incremental costs associated with newlyadded health screenings and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols to protect our employees at our facilities which may continue increase or become necessary in these or other areas the extent of covid19’s effect on our operational and financial performance in the future will depend on future developments including the duration spread and intensity of the pandemic our continued ability to manufacture and distribute our products any future government actions affecting consumers and the economy generally changing economic conditions and any resulting inflationary impacts as well as timing and effectiveness of global vaccines all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape although the potential effects that covid19 may continue to have on the company are not clear such impacts could materially adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

dependence on key customers could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the company’s net sales net sales to the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates were 25  of consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended june 30 2021 2020 and 2019 and occurred across all of the company’s reportable segments the company’s five largest customers accounted for nearly half of the company’s consolidated net sales for each of the fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 and a significant portion of the company’s future revenues may continue to be derived from a small number of customers as a result changes in the strategies of the company’s largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry a shift of shelf space to “private label” or competitors’ products or a decision to lower pricing of consumer products including branded products may harm the company’s net sales or margins and reduce the ability of the company to offer new innovative products to consumers in addition the use of the latest technology by our customers regarding pricing may lead to category pricing pressures consistent with the ongoing variability in information technology systems industrywide our information technology platforms may not be fully compatible at all times with those used by our customers therefore it may or may not have an impact on our ability to respond to customer demands specific to data or technology furthermore any loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in net sales to a key customer even if such loss or reduction relates to a key customer of a business unit of the company could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders and the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its customers accordingly customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the company at any time and for any reason if the company does not effectively respond to the demands of its customers they could decrease their purchases from the company causing the company’s net sales and net earnings to decline furthermore unfavorable market conditions or competitive pressures may cause the company’s customers to reevaluate the number and mix of brands they sell resulting in lower purchases of the company’s products by these customers we regularly review the financial strength of our key customers and where appropriate modify customer credit limits which may have an adverse impact on future sales 

    

with the growing trend towards retailer consolidation both in the us and internationally the rapid growth of ecommerce and the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers we are increasingly dependent on certain retailers this trend which has been magnified due to the covid19 pandemic has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailers who have in the past changed and may in the future change their business strategies demand lower pricing or higher trade discounts or impose other burdensome requirements on product suppliers or move away from branded products to “private label” these large consolidated companies could also exert additional competitive pressure on the company’s other customers which could in turn lead to such customers demanding lower pricing higher trade discounts or special packaging or imposing other onerous requirements on the company if the company ceases doing business with a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease due to customer inventory reductions or otherwise the company’s business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

sales growth objectives may be difficult to achieve the company may not be able to successfully implement price increases and market and category declines and changes to the company’s product and geographic mix may adversely impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

a large percentage of the company’s revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition during fiscal year 2021 85 of the company’s net sales were attributable to us markets including us territories the company’s ability to achieve sales growth depends on its ability to drive growth through innovation including as part of its ignite strategy expand into new products and categories channels and countries invest in its established brands and enhanced merchandising grow categories with retailers and capture market share from competitors the company’s ability to achieve sales growth also depends on foreign currency fluctuations a weakening of foreign currencies in which sales are generated relative to the company’s reporting currency us dollars would decrease net sales the company is implementing price increases and may implement additional price increases in the future which may slow sales growth or create volume declines in the short term as customers and consumers adjust to these price increases in addition our competitors may or may not take competitive actions which may lead to sales declines and loss of market share if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product innovations undertake sales marketing and advertising initiatives that grow its product categories andor develop acquire or successfully launch new products or brands it may not achieve its sales growth objectives furthermore a general decline in the markets for certain product categories has had and may in the future have a negative impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations in addition changes to the mix of products that the company sells as well as the mix of countries in which its products are sold may adversely impact the company’s net sales profitability and cash flow 

acquisitions new venture investments and divestitures may not be successful which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with the company’s strategy the company expects to continue to seek acquisition joint venture and investment opportunities however the company may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic transactions at attractive prices in addition an increase in regulatory restrictions or continued market volatility could hinder the company’s ability to execute strategic business activities including any acquisitions or investments furthermore all acquisitions and investments entail numerous risks including risks relating to the company’s ability to 

• successfully integrate acquired companies brands products technologies systems or personnel into the company’s existing business operations in an effective timely and cost efficient manner 

• maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies throughout acquired companies including effective integration of acquired companies into the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

• successfully enter categories and markets in which the company may have limited or no prior experience 

• achieve expected synergies and obtain the desired financial or strategic benefits from acquisitions within the anticipated time periods if at all 

• achieve distribution expansion related to products categories and markets from acquisition and retain key relationships of acquired companies 

• identify and manage any legal or reputational risks that may predate or be associated with a transaction which could negatively impact the company following the consummation of such transaction and 

• manage other unanticipated problems or liabilities 

acquired companies or operations joint ventures or investments may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability and cash flow expectations furthermore acquisitions or ventures could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt the assumption of contingent liabilities such as those relating to advertising claims environmental issues and litigation an increase in expenses related to intangible assets including trademarks and goodwill and increased operating expenses all of which could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would subject the company to local regulations and could 

    

potentially lead to risks related to among other things increased exposure to foreign exchange rate changes tax or labor laws government price control repatriation of profits and liabilities relating to the foreign corrupt practices act in addition to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the company’s acquisitions or investments diminish in the future or the performance of such acquired companies is less robust than expected the company may be required to record impairment charges such as the 329 million pretax noncash impairment charge that the company recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 as a result of an adjustment to the carrying values of goodwill trademarks and other assets in the better health vitamins minerals and supplements vms business any impairment charges could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations

loss of or inability to attract key personnel could adversely impact the company’s business 

the company’s success depends in part on its continuing ability to identify hire develop and retain highly qualified and diverse personnel the labor market for these employees is very competitive and wages and compensation costs continue to increase we compete to attract talent within and outside of our industry for high demand skills that are scarce in key geographic areas such as the san francisco bay area the company may not be able to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future related activities to identify hire and onboard qualified talent at increasing compensation costs may require significant time and expense which could further adversely affect the company’s operations and financial results the company’s success also depends on its ability to retain its key personnel including its executive officers and senior management team and to continue to implement its succession plans for senior management and other key employees the unexpected loss or unavailability of one or more of the company’s key leaders could disrupt its business 

operational risks 

volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials energy transportation labor and other necessary supplies or services have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the company’s net earnings and cash flow 

volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials including resin nonwoven fabrics for wipes products sodium hypochlorite corrugated cardboard soybean oil solvent derivatives of amines and other chemicals and agricultural commodities and increases in the cost of energy transportation labor and other necessary supplies or services for commercial economic or other reasons including as caused by inflationary pressures have harmed and may continue to harm the company’s results of operations we distribute our products and receive raw materials primarily by rail and truck reduced availability of rail or trucking capacity and labor shortages have caused and could continue to cause us to incur unanticipated expenses in particular reduced trucking capacity due to shortages of drivers as a result of the covid19 pandemic and a federal regulation requiring drivers to electronically log their driving hours among other reasons have caused an increase in the cost of transportation for us and our suppliers if such increases occur or exceed the company’s estimates and the company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases its results of operations would be harmed in addition even if the company increases the prices of its products in response to increases in the cost of commodities or other cost increases it may not be able to sustain its price increases sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or customers may decide not to pay the higher prices which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share and the company’s projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations 

to reduce the cost volatility associated with anticipated purchases of certain commodities the company uses derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps the extent of the company’s derivative position at any given time depends on the company’s assessment of the markets for these commodities the cost volatility in the markets and the cost of the derivative instruments many of the commodities used by the company in its products do not have actively traded derivative instruments if the company does not or is unable to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if it executes a position and costs subsequently decrease the company’s costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than its competitors’ costs and the company’s financial results could be adversely affected for further information regarding the company’s use of derivative instruments see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in exhibit 991 

supply chain issues may result in product shortages or disruptions to the company’s business 

the company has a complex global network of suppliers that has recently expanded to meet increased customer demand and may in the future further evolve in response to market conditions the company also relies on a number of solesource and singlesource suppliers for certain commodities and raw material inputs including packaging product components finished products and other necessary supplies the company could experience material disruptions in production and other supply chain issues including as a result of supply chain dependencies which could result in outofstock conditions and its results of operations and relationships with customers could be adversely affected if new or existing suppliers are unable to meet any standards set by the company government or industry regulations or the company’s customers if the company is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity quality and price levels needed for its business if any of the company’s key suppliers becomes insolvent ceases or significantly reduces its operations or experiences financial distress or if any environmental 

    

economic or other outside factors impact its operations the company also requires new and existing suppliers to meet its ethical and business partner standards suppliers may also have to meet governmental and industry standards and any relevant standards required by the company’s customers which may require additional investment and time on behalf of suppliers and the company 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in elevated demand for disinfecting products and other consumer and professional products as compared to prepandemic levels even though us consumers have begun to adjust their behaviors as vaccination rates have improved this has caused strain on the company’s supply chain network and its ability to meet such demand especially with respect to its disinfecting products due to among other things the loss or disruption to the timely availability of adequate supplies of raw materials and finished goods that the company requires for the manufacture of its products disruptions in transportation and logistics operations and shortage restriction or disruption in its manufacturing and distribution capacity the company’s inability to fully or substantially meet such demand could result in among other things shortages in the companys products unmet consumer demand leading to reduced preference for the company’s products in the future customers purchasing products from the company’s competitors as a result of such shortage of products strained customer relationships termination of customer contracts additional competition and new entrants into the market and loss of potential sales and revenue which could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or a failure of key information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations and reputation 

to conduct its business the company relies extensively on information technology systems many of which are managed hosted provided andor used by thirdparties and their vendors these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to communicating within the company and with customers consumers vendors investors and other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products receiving and processing purchase orders and shipping products to customers processing transactions storing processing and transmitting data including personal confidential information and payment card industry data hosting processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research business and financial information and complying with financial reporting regulatory legal and tax requirements furthermore the company sells certain of its burt’s bees® natural personal care products vitamins minerals supplements and other products directly to consumers online and through websites mobile apps and connected devices and the company also engages in online activities including promotions rebates and customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information through the use of any of these information technology systems or processes the company or its vendors have in the past and could in the future again experience cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or other incidents that may result in unauthorized access disclosure and misuse of consumer customer employee vendor or company information especially at a time when a large number of the company’s employees are working remotely and accessing its technology infrastructure remotely as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

the company also utilizes various hardware software and operating systems that may need to be upgraded or replaced in the near future as such system cease to be supported by thirdparty service providers and may be vulnerable to increased risks including the risk of security breaches system failures and disruptions any such upgrade could take time oversight and be costly to the company if such systems are not successfully upgraded or replaced in a timely manner system outages disruptions or delays or other issues may arise if a new system does not function properly or is not adequately supported by thirdparty service providers and processes it could adversely affect the company’s business and operations which in turn adversely impact the company’s results of operations and cash flows 

despite the security measures the company has in place the information technology systems including those of our customers vendors suppliers and other thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted have in the past and may in the future be vulnerable to cyberthreats such as computer viruses or other malicious codes security breaches unauthorized access phishing attacks and other disruptions from employee error unauthorized uses system failures including internet outages unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors or cyberattacks by hackers criminal groups nationastates and nationstatesponsored organizations and socialactivist organizations the company’s information technology systems and its thirdparty providers’ systems have been and will likely continue to be subject to cyberthreats such as computer viruses or other malicious codes ransomware unauthorized access attempts denial of service attacks phishing social engineering hacking and other cyberattacks the company has seen an increase in the number of such attacks recently as a large number of its employees are working remotely and accessing its technology infrastructure remotely as a result of the covid19 pandemic furthermore such attacks may originate from nation states or attempts by outside parties hackers criminal organizations or other threat actors to date the company is not aware that its business or operations have been materially impacted by these attacks however the company’s security efforts and the efforts of its thirdparty providers may not prevent or timely detect attacks and resulting breaches or breakdowns of the company’s or its thirdparty service providers’ databases or systems in addition if the company or its thirdparty providers are unable to effectively resolve such breaches or breakdowns on a timely basis the company may experience interruptions in its ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm governmental fines penalties regulatory proceedings and litigation and remediation expenses in addition such incidents could result in unauthorized disclosure and misuse of material confidential information including personal information cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated are constantly evolving and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives and this increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them 

    

in addition data breaches or theft of personal information collected by the company and its thirdparty service providers as well as company information and assets have occurred in the past and may occur in the future the company is subject to the laws and regulations of various countries where it operates or does business related to solicitation collection processing transferring storing or use of consumer customer vendor or employee information or related data including the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which went into effect in may 2018 and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” which went into effect in january 2020 the changes introduced by data privacy and protection regulations increase the complexity of regulations enacted to protect business and personal data and they subject the company to additional costs and have required and may in the future require costly changes to the company’s security systems policies procedures and practices these laws and regulations also may result in the company incurring additional expenses and liabilities in the event of unauthorized access to or disclosure of personal data 

a breach or other breakdown in the company’s technology including a cyberattack privacy breach data breach or other incident involving the company or any of the companys thirdparty service providers or vendors that results in unauthorized disclosure or significant unavailability of business financial personal or stakeholder information could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations in addition if the company’s service providers suppliers or customers experience a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in the company’s supply chain or reduced customer orders or other business operations which would adversely affect the company 

the operations of the company and its suppliers are subject to disruption by events beyond the company’s control 

operations of the company its suppliers including solesource and singlesource suppliers service providers and retail customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages cyberattacks and other disruptions in information technology systems demonstrations political instability or uncertainty in the us or abroad disease outbreaks or pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic acts of war terrorism fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters or weather events disruptions in logistics loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites supplier capacity constraints raw material and product quality or safety issues industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues in addition the company’s corporate headquarters and primary research and development facility are located near major earthquake fault lines in california if a major disruption at the company or its suppliers were to occur it could result delays or suspension of operations including loss of access or unauthorized disclosure of critical data or shipments of products any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations and international trade 

in fiscal year 2021 15 of the company’s net sales were attributable to international markets the company faces and will continue to face substantial risks associated with its foreign operations including but not limited to 

• global or local economic or political instability 

• foreign currency fluctuations including devaluations currency controls and inflation which may adversely affect the company’s ability to do business in certain markets and reduce the us dollar value of revenues profits or cash flows it generates in nonus markets 

• continued high levels of inflation in argentina which have required and may continue to require the company to record gains and losses in net earnings to reflect the remeasurement of the companys non‐us dollar monetary assets and liabilities of argentina 

• difficulty in obtaining nonlocal currency eg us dollars to pay for the raw materials needed to manufacture the company’s products and contractmanufactured products 

• the imposition of tariffs trade restrictions price profit or other government controls labor laws immigration restrictions travel restrictions including as a result of covid19 or other pandemics or epidemics import and export laws or other government actions generating a negative impact on the company’s business including changes in trade policies that may be implemented and the impact of geopolitical events generally

legal and regulatory risks 

government regulations could impose material costs 

generally the manufacture processing formulation packaging labeling storage distribution advertising and sale of the company’s products and the conduct of its business operations must comply with extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations for example in the us many of the company’s products are regulated by the environmental protection agency the food and drug administration including applicable current good manufacturing practice regulations andor the consumer product safety commission and the company’s product claims and advertising are regulated by the federal trade commission among other regulatory agencies additionally the company’s and its suppliers’ manufacturing and distribution operations are also subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies the company’s international operations are also subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products there is also an increased risk of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and related difficulties in maintaining effective internal controls additionally the company could be subject to future inquiries or investigations by governmental and other regulatory bodies any determination that the company’s operations or activities are not in compliance with applicable law could expose the company to future impairment charges or significant fines penalties or other sanctions that may result in a reduction in net income or otherwise adversely impact the business and reputation of the company 

fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties may also impact the company’s effective tax rate and the company’s results of operations and changes in tax laws including additional guidance issued by the us treasury department or the us internal revenue service could create uncertainty impact our recorded liability in future periods and have a material impact on the company’s results of operations 

in particular because of the company’s extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations or allegations of violations of the foreign corrupt practices act and similar international antibribery laws these antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls policies and procedures that mandate compliance with these laws will protect us from reckless intentional or unintentional criminal acts committed by our employees jointventure partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business financial condition and results of operations 

federal state and foreign governments may introduce new or expand existing legislation and regulations or courts or governmental authorities could impose more stringent interpretations of existing legislation and regulations affecting the company’s operations which may require the company to increase its resources capabilities and expertise in certain areas for example the company is subject to regulations regarding the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment including as a result of evolving climate change standards and regulations in other areas such as with respect to “conflict minerals” and subject to increased costs or mandatory funding or financial support for recycling and waste management programs under extended producer responsibility regulation or laws such regulations could negatively impact the company’s ability to obtain raw materials or could increase its acquisition and compliance costs or cause the company to contribute funds to recycling and other waste management infrastructure thus making our products more costly less competitive than other competitive products or reduce consumer demand furthermore additional or amended legislation in the 

    

areas of esg disclosure or other matters healthcare reform sustainability of packaging including plastic packaging executive compensation and corporate governance could also increase the company’s costs 

the company is also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the united states and other jurisdictions including the gdpr and the ccpa the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations are continuously developing and evolving and there is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with them the changes introduced by the gdpr and the ccpa as well as any other changes to existing privacy and data protection laws and regulations and the introduction of similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions have subjected and may continue in the future to subject the company to additional costs and have required and may in the future require costly changes to the company’s security systems policies procedures and practices which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

if the company is found to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas it could be subject to governmental or regulatory actions including fines import detentions injunctions product withdrawals or recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations particularly with respect to its charcoal business could delay or prevent the company from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations in addition the company markets and sells products that are subject to regulations relating to dietary supplements in order to comply with any changes in these laws and regulations including any changes that result from newly published clinical studies and emerging studies that may assert or prove that ingredients in our products or our products themselves are ineffective or harmful to consumers the company may be required to make changes to product formulation labeling or marketing claims perform additional testing to substantiate its product claims make costly changes in its manufacturing processes or supply chain or stop selling certain products until corrective actions have been taken any of these developments could increase the company’s costs significantly which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

product liability and labeling claims commercial claims or other legal proceedings could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

the company has in the past paid and may be required in the future to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products such claims may be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants or provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use have defective packaging fail to perform as advertised or damage property or persons product liability advertising and labeling claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation sales and results of operations and the reputation of the company’s brands in addition if any of the company’s products is found to be defective the company may recall such products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses in july 2020 the company’s subsidiary in peru voluntarily recalled the poett® dilutable cleaning products sold in peru which recall affects all such poett® products manufactured in peru on or before june 30 2020 the company is responding to and defending government regulatory inquiries regarding the recall and could be the subject of additional litigation fines penalties or other liability relating to property damage personal injury negative publicity or other losses in connection with the recall although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims may be subject to a deductible exceed the amount of insurance coverage or be excluded under the terms of the policies

esg issues including those related to climate change and sustainability may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation 

companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their esg policies increased focus and activism related to esg may hinder the company’s access to capital as investors may reconsider their capital investment as a result of their assessment of the company’s esg practices in particular customers consumers investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental issues including climate change water use deforestation plastic waste and other sustainability concerns changing consumer preferences may result in increased demands regarding plastics and packaging materials including singleuse and nonrecyclable plastic packaging and other components of our products and their environmental impact on sustainability a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredients or increased consumer concerns or perceptions whether accurate or inaccurate regarding the effects of ingredients or substances present in certain consumer products these demands could cause us to incur additional costs or to make changes to our operations to comply with such demands 

concern over climate change or plastics and packaging materials in particular may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment increased regulatory requirements including in relation to various aspects of esg including disclosure requirements or environmental causes may result in increased compliance or input costs of energy raw materials or compliance with emissions standards which may cause disruptions in the manufacture of our products or an increase in operating costs any failure to achieve our esg goals or a perception whether or not valid of our failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to new or changes in legal or regulatory requirements concerning environmental or other esg matters or increased operating or manufacturing costs due to increased regulation or environmental causes could adversely affect our business and reputation 

if the company does not adapt to or comply with new regulations or fails to meet the esg goals under its ignite strategy or evolving investor industry or stakeholder expectations and standards or if the company is perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for esg issues customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from another company or a competitor and the company’s reputation business or financial condition may be adversely affected 

environmental matters create potential liabilities that could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to air emissions water discharges handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances and climate change the company has incurred and will continue to incur significant expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations and such expenditures reduce the cash flow available to the company for other purposes

the company had a recorded liability of  28 million as of both june 30 2021 and 2020 for its share of aggregate future remediation costs related to certain environmental matters including response actions at various locations two matters relating to environmental costs associated with one of the company’s former operations at a site located in alameda county california and another relating to operations in dickinson county michigan account for a significant portion of the recorded liability the company’s estimated losses related to these matters are sensitive to a variety of uncertain factors including the ability of third parties to pay their share of the response and remediation obligations the efficacy of any remediation efforts changes in any remediation requirements and the future availability of alternative cleanup technologies and the company’s exposure may exceed the amount recorded for these matters see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the notes to consolidated financial statements in exhibit 991 for additional information related to these liabilities 

    

failure to effectively utilize successfully assert or successfully defend the company’s intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness if the company is found to have infringed the intellectual property of rights or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights its competitiveness could be negatively impacted 

the company relies on intellectual property rights based on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its brands products packaging for its products inventions and confidential information there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions and product innovations the company cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be invalidated circumvented or challenged and the company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert its intellectual property rights or to defend those rights from assertions of invalidity in addition even if such rights are obtained in the us the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us it is also possible that the company’s brands may not be available for use in certain countries due to prior third party rights thereby limiting expansion of the company’s brands the company also licenses certain of its brands to third parties and has increased its focus on licensing its intellectual property in connection with the codevelopment of products or devices or promotion and sales relationships with companies in industries operating in public spaces if other parties infringe the company’s intellectual property rights they may dilute or diminish the value of the company’s brands and products in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the company’s brands and harm its net sales the failure to perfect and protect its intellectual property rights could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition if the company is found to have violated the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of thirdparty marks ideas or technologies such a finding could result in the need to cease use of such trademark trade secret copyrighted work or patented invention in the company’s business as well as the obligation to pay for past infringement if holders are willing to permit the company to continue to use such intellectual property rights they could require a payment of a substantial amount for continued use of those rights either ceasing use or paying such amounts could cause the company to become less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations even if the company is not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights the company could incur material legal costs and related expenses to defend against such claims of infringement and the company could incur significant costs associated with suspending its use of the challenged intellectual property rights even if it is ultimately found not to have infringed such rights 

the company’s business could be negatively impacted as a result of stockholder activism or an unsolicited takeover proposal or a proxy contest 

in recent years proxy contests and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies including the company during fiscal years 2012 and 2011 the company was the target of an unsolicited takeover proposal from a stockholder activist which resulted in significant costs to the company if such a proposal were to be made again the company would likely incur significant costs which could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations stockholder activists may also seek to involve themselves in the governance strategic direction and operations of the company through stockholder proposals or otherwise such proposals may disrupt the company’s business and divert the attention of the company’s management and employees and any perceived uncertainties as to the company’s future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities the perception that the company needs a change in the direction of its business or the perception that the company is unstable or lacks continuity which may be exploited by our competitors cause concern to our current or potential customers and make it more difficult for the company to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners which could adversely affect the company’s business in addition actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business 

our amended and restated bylaws designate specific courts as the exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a judicial forum of their choice for disputes with us 

our amended and restated bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the state courts of delaware or if no state court has jurisdiction the federal district court of the district of delaware will to the fullest extent permitted by law be the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions or proceedings under delaware statutory or common law the choice of forum provision in our bylaws does not waive our compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder moreover the provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the exchange act or by the securities act 

our exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum of such stockholders’ choice for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees which may discourage such lawsuits even though an action if successful might benefit our stockholders if a court were to find our exclusive forum provision either to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions all of which may increase our costs of litigation any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any

the company’s indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations and prevent the company from fulfilling its financial obligations and the company may not be able to maintain its current credit ratings may not continue to pay dividends or repurchase its stock and may not remain in compliance with existing debt covenants 

as of june 30 2021 the company had nearly 3 billion of debt the company’s indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

• require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness which would reduce the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital requirements capital expenditures future acquisitions dividends repurchase the company’s common stock and for other general corporate purposes 

• limit the company’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to general adverse economic conditions or changes in its business and the industries in which it operates 

• place the company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt and 

• limit along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the company’s debt documents its ability to borrow additional funds 

the company may also incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions repurchase stock or fund other activities for general business purposes in addition the london interbank offered rate libor the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate for certain borrowings under the company’s revolving credit facility is expected to be phased out by the end of calendar year 2023 

further certain terms of the agreements governing the company’s overthecounter derivative instruments contain provisions that require the company’s credit ratings as assigned by standard  poor’s and moody’s to the company to remain at a level equal to or better than the minimum of an investment grade credit rating as of june 30 2021 the company had been assigned investmentgrade ratings with both standard  poor’s and moody’s however if the company’s credit ratings were to fall below investment grade the counterparties to the derivative instruments in net liability positions could request full collateralization and it may negatively impact the company’s other financial arrangements including the supply chain financing arrangement offered by a financial institution to our suppliers which could in turn impact our working capital 

any disruption in the financial markets interest rate increases changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates that replace libor increases to our indebtedness levels or changes to our credit ratings could negatively impact our ability to access financial markets or increase our borrowing costs 

the company has historically declared and paid quarterly cash dividends on its common stock and has been authorized to repurchase its stock subject to certain limitations under its stock repurchase programs any determinations by the board of directors to continue to declare and pay cash dividends on the company’s common stock or to repurchase the company’s common stock however will be based primarily upon the company’s financial condition results of operations and business requirements its access to debt capital markets or other forms of financing the price of its common stock in the case of the repurchase program and the board of directors’ continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration and payment of dividends are in the best interests of the company’s stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs in the event the company does not declare and pay a quarterly dividend or discontinues its stock repurchases the company’s stock price could be adversely affected

the covid19 pandemic has caused a significant worldwide increase in demand for disinfecting products and other consumer and professional products this has caused strain on the company’s supply chain network and its ability to meet such demand in addition the company generally utilizes supply contracts to help ensure availability and a number of forwardpurchase contracts to help reduce the volatility of the pricing of raw materials needed in its operations however the company is highly exposed to changes in the prices of commodities used as raw materials in the manufacturing of its products for further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in exhibit 991 “risk factors – volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials energy transportation labor and other necessary supplies or services have negatively impacted and continue to negatively impact the company’s net earnings and cash flow” and “risk factors – supply chain issues as a result of a reliance on a limited base of suppliers or the covid19 pandemic may result in product shortages or disruptions to the company’s business” in item 1a

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties set forth below as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report or in other filings by the company with the sec could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the company or that are not currently believed by the company to be material may also harm the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the company faces intense competition in its markets which could lead to reduced net sales net earnings and cash flow 

the company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the us and in its international markets most of the company’s products compete with other widely advertised promoted and merchandised brands within each product category the company also faces competition from retailers including club stores grocery stores drugstores dollar stores mass merchandisers ecommerce retailers and subscription services which are increasingly offering “private label” brands that are typically sold at lower prices and compete with the company’s products in certain categories in addition during times of economic uncertainty consumers may purchase more “private label” or other lower priced brands increased purchases of “private label” products could reduce net sales of the company’s highermargin products or there could be a shift in product mix to lowermargin offerings which would negatively impact our margins 

the company’s products generally compete on the basis of product performance brand recognition and price advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have significant impacts on consumer purchasing decisions and the company is increasingly using digital media marketing and promotional programs to reach consumers a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it typically requires continued advertising promotional support and product innovations to maintain its relative market position if the company’s advertising marketing and promotional programs including its use of digital media to reach consumers are not effective or adequate the company’s net sales may be negatively impacted 

some of the company’s competitors are larger than the company and have greater financial resources these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the company can in addition as the company currently experiences increased demand for many of its products especially its disinfecting products in response to covid19 it expects heightened competitive activity from strong local competitors other large multinational companies and new entrants into the market in many of its categories especially the disinfecting category the company expects such activities to include more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges increased promotional spending and geographic expansion and marketing of new disinfecting products it expects promotional activities to increase as retailers try aggressively to get consumers back into their stores after prolonged “stay at home” and other government restrictions continue to ease over the coming months furthermore the company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the company competitive activity may require the company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions andor reduce prices which could lead to reduced sales margins andor net earnings 

    

the changing retail environment and changing consumer preferences could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s sales are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery mass retail outlet warehouse club and dollar store channels however the retail environment is continuing to evolve and may change to a more significant extent or at a faster pace in light of the covid19 pandemic with a greater consumer emphasis on health and wellness and this could significantly change the way traditional retailers do business alternative retail channels including ecommerce retailers hard discounters subscription services and buying clubs have become more prevalent and consumers are increasingly purchasing products through such alternative retail channels in addition a growing number of alternative sales channels and business models such as niche brands native online brands private label and store brands directtoconsumer brands and channels and discounter channels have emerged in the markets we serve in particular the growing presence of and increasing sales through ecommerce retailers have affected and may continue to affect consumer preferences as consumers increasingly shop online including in response to the covid19 pandemic and market dynamics including any pricing pressures for consumer goods as retailers face added costs to build their ecommerce capacity these trends have been magnified due to the covid19 pandemic in many of our geographies further consumer preferences continue to evolve due to a number of factors including fragmentation of the consumer market and changes in consumer demographics which includes the aging of the general population and the emergence of millennial and younger generations who have different spending consumption and purchasing habits evolving consumer concerns or perceptions regarding environmental social and governance practices of manufacturers including the sourcing and sustainability of packaging materials such as plastic packaging a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredients evolving consumer concerns or perceptions whether accurate or inaccurate regarding the effects of ingredients or substances present in certain consumer products and changing consumer sentiment toward nonlocal products or sources if we are not successful in continuing to adapt to changing consumer preferences and market dynamics or expanding sales through ecommerce retailers hard discounters and other alternative retail channels our business financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted in addition the growth of the alternative retail channels that are focused on limiting the number of items they sell and selling predominantly “private label” products may reduce the company’s ability to market and sell its products through such retailers in addition these alternative retail channels may create significant pricing pressures for consumer goods presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases in all of the channels into which the company sells if these alternative retail channels were to take significant market share away from traditional retailers andor the company is not successful in these alternative retail channels or business models our margins and results of operations may be materially and negatively impacted 

the currently evolving situation related to the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

in january 2020 the world health organization declared the covid19 outbreak to be a public health emergency and in march 2020 it declared the outbreak to be a pandemic the covid19 outbreak has caused severe global economic and societal disruptions and uncertainties in response to the virus countries and local governments placed tens of millions of people under lockdown and imposed travel restrictions and restrictions on the operation of nonessential businesses and services companies have also taken precautions such as requiring employees to work remotely and temporarily closing businesses although some of these restrictions were relaxed some of those restrictions have been reimposed and the current restrictions and future prevention and mitigation measures imposed by governments and private companies are likely to continue to have a severe adverse impact on global economic conditions and consumer confidence and spending the covid19 pandemic may negatively affect our business by causing or contributing to among other things the following 

• significant disruptions to our manufacturing distribution and supply operations including closure of our significant manufacturing and distribution facilities 

• cessation or significant reductions in the operations of or the inability or significant disruptions in the ability to meet obligations to us of significant thirdparty suppliers vendors external manufacturers and other business or commercial partners which may be caused by their business operational or financial difficulties among other reasons 

    

• significant decreases in sales of or demand for or significant volatility in sales of or demand for one or more of our significant products due to among other things closure or reduction in operating hours of our key customers the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to prolonged inventory shortages illness or government implemented lockdowns quarantine or other restrictions changes in consumer behavior or preference including as a result of shortages in any of our products reductions in the availability of one or more of our products as we prioritize the production of other products due to increased demand decreased availability of our products in the nearterm leading to reduced preference or demand for such products in the long term decreased future demand due to customer or consumer stockpiling of products in the present any negative impact to our reputation resulting from an adverse perception of our response to the pandemic perceived price gouging effected by third parties that we do not control or product recommendations by public health officials the modification by retailers or distributors of their restocking or fulfillment practices or the worldwide regional and local adverse economies and financial market conditions 

• significant disruptions to our business operations due to among other things unavailability of key employees including our executive officers and senior management team as a result of illness to themselves or their families any cyberattack and other disruptions to informational technologies cancellation or other disruptions of sales and marketing events disruptions to trade promotion initiatives and any delays or modifications to any significant cost savings or other strategic initiatives 

• additional or renewed significant governmental actions both in the us and in international markets where we manufacture market and sell our products including lockdowns quarantines or other restrictions on the ability of our employees to travel or perform necessary business functions or our ability to manufacture ship distribute market or sell our products changes in currency rates and commodity costs associated with governmental actions or general economic trends or other limitations or restrictions on our ability to manufacture distribute market or sell our products or the ability of our suppliers customers or thirdparty partners to effectively run their operations which may negatively impact our ability to manufacture distribute market and sell our products 

in addition we have experienced higher costs in certain areas as a result of covid19 such as transportation and logistics and production employee compensation as well as incremental costs associated with newlyadded health screenings and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols to protect our employees at our facilities which we expect could continue or could increase in these or could be necessary in other areas furthermore difficult economic conditions may have a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and other funding sources on acceptable terms or at all should we seek any such financing in the future 

the extent of covid19’s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments including the duration spread and intensity of the pandemic our continued ability to manufacture and distribute our products as well as any future government actions affecting consumers and the economy generally all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict especially in light of the rapidly evolving social and political situations in response to the pandemic we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by local state federal or foreign authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees consumers customers or business partners although the potential effects that covid19 may have on the company are not clear such impacts could materially adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

supply chain issues as a result of a reliance on a limited base of suppliers or the covid19 pandemic may result in product shortages or disruptions to the company’s business 

the company relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain commodities and raw material inputs including solesource and singlesource suppliers for certain of its raw materials packaging product components finished products and other necessary supplies the company requires new and existing suppliers to meet its ethical and business partner standards suppliers may also have to meet governmental and industry standards and any relevant standards required by the company’s customers which may require additional investment and time on behalf of suppliers and the company the company could experience material disruptions in production and other supply chain issues including as a result of supply chain dependencies which could result in outofstock conditions and its results of operations and relationships with customers could be adversely affected if new or existing suppliers are unable to meet any standards set by the company government or industry regulations or the company’s customers if the company is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity quality and price levels needed for its business if any of the company’s key suppliers becomes insolvent ceases or significantly reduces its operations or experiences financial distress as a result of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise or if any environmental economic or other outside factors impact its operations 

    

the covid19 pandemic has caused a significant worldwide increase in demand for disinfecting products and other consumer and professional products this has caused strain on the company’s supply chain network and its ability to meet such demand especially with respect to its disinfecting products due to among other things the loss or disruption to the timely availability of adequate supplies of raw materials and finished goods that the company requires for the manufacture of its products disruptions in transportation and logistics operations and shortage restriction or disruption in its manufacturing and distribution capacity the company’s inability to fully or substantially meet such demand could result in among other things shortages in the companys products unmet consumer demand leading to reduced preference for the company’s products in the future customers purchasing products from the company’s competitors as a result of such shortage of products strained customer relationships termination of customer contracts additional competition and new entrants into the market and loss of potential sales and revenue which could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

dependence on key customers could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the company’s net sales net sales to the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates were 25  25 and 26 of consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended june 30 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively and occurred across all of the company’s reportable segments no other individual customer accounted for 10 or more of the company’s consolidated net sales in any of these fiscal years the company’s five largest customers accounted for nearly half of the company’s consolidated net sales for each of the fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 and a significant portion of the company’s future revenues may continue to be derived from a small number of customers as a result changes in the strategies of the company’s largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry a shift of shelf space to “private label” or competitors’ products or a decision to lower pricing of consumer products including branded products may harm the company’s net sales or margins and reduce the ability of the company to offer new innovative products to consumers in addition the use of the latest technology by our customers regarding pricing may lead to category pricing pressures furthermore any loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in net sales to a key customer even if such loss or reduction relates to a key customer of a business unit of the company could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders and the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its customers accordingly customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the company at any time and for any reason if the company does not effectively respond to the demands of its customers they could decrease their purchases from the company causing the company’s net sales and net earnings to decline furthermore unfavorable market conditions or competitive pressures may cause the company’s customers to reevaluate the number and mix of brands they sell resulting in lower purchases of the company’s products by these customers in addition some of our customers have experienced and may experience in the future declining financial performance such as in response to the covid19 pandemic which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all we regularly review the financial strength of our key customers and where appropriate modify customer credit limits which may have an adverse impact on future sales 

with the growing trend towards retailer consolidation both in the us and internationally the rapid growth of ecommerce and the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers we are increasingly dependent on certain retailers this trend which has been magnified due to the covid19 pandemic has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailers who have in the past changed and may in the future change their business strategies demand lower pricing or higher trade discounts or impose other burdensome requirements on product suppliers these business demands may relate to inventory practices instore on online product placement transportation and storage or product packaging such customers may also shift their focus away from branded products toward “private label” or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship these large consolidated companies could also exert additional competitive pressure on the company’s other customers which could in turn lead to such customers demanding lower pricing higher trade discounts or special packaging or imposing other onerous requirements on the company if the company ceases doing business with a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease due to customer inventory reductions or otherwise the company’s business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

    

cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or a failure of key information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operation and its reputation 

to conduct its business the company relies extensively on information technology systems many of which are managed hosted provided andor used by thirdparties and their vendors these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to communicating within the company and with customers consumers vendors investors and other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products receiving and processing purchase orders and shipping products to customers processing transactions storing processing and transmitting data including personal confidential information and payment card industry data hosting processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research business and financial information summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with financial reporting regulatory legal and tax requirements and implementing other processes involved in managing the business furthermore the company sells certain of its burt’s bees ® natural personal care products renewlife ® digestive health products and nutranext dietary supplements and other products directly to consumers online and through websites mobile apps and connected devices and the company also engages in online activities including promotions rebates and customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information through the use of any of these information technology systems or processes the company or its vendors could experience cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or other incidents that may result in unauthorized access disclosure and misuse of consumer customer employee vendor or company information especially at a time when a large number of the company’s employees are working remotely and accessing its technology infrastructure remotely as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

the company continues to utilize various legacy hardware software and operating systems which may be vulnerable to increased risks including the risk of system failures and disruptions in addition some of the legacy systems will need to be upgraded or replaced in the future as such systems cease to be supported by thirdparty service providers if such systems are not successfully upgraded or replaced in a timely manner system outages disruptions or delays or other issues may arise the company must also successfully integrate the technology systems of acquired companies into the company’s existing and future technology systems including with thirdparty service providers and processes if a new system does not function properly or is not adequately supported by thirdparty service providers and processes it could affect the company’s ability to process and deliver customer orders and process and receive payments for its products this could adversely impact the company’s results of operations and cash flows 

despite the security measures the company has in place the information technology systems including those of our customers vendors suppliers and other thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted may be vulnerable to cyberthreats such as computer viruses or other malicious codes security breaches unauthorized access attempts phishing attacks and other disruptions from employee error unauthorized uses system failures including internet outages unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors or cyberattacks by hackers criminal groups nationstate organizations or socialactivist organizations the company’s information technology systems and its thirdparty providers’ systems have been and will likely continue to be subject to cyberthreats such as computer viruses or other malicious codes ransomware unauthorized access attempts denial of service attacks phishing social engineering hacking and other cyberattacks the company has seen an increase in the number of such attacks recently as a large number of its employees are working remotely and accessing its technology infrastructure remotely as a result of the covid19 pandemic furthermore such attacks may originate from nation states or attempts by outside parties hackers criminal organizations or other threat actors to date the company’s business or operations have not been materially impacted by these attacks however the company cannot guarantee that its security efforts will prevent or timely detect attacks and resulting breaches or breakdowns of the company’s or its thirdparty service providers’ databases or systems in addition any significant breaches or breakdowns of such database or systems could result in significant costs including costs to investigate or remediate if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes including catastrophic events power outages security breaches cyberattacks or other similar events or as a result of legacy systems and if the company’s business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis the company may experience interruptions in its ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm governmental fines penalties regulatory proceedings litigation and remediation expenses any of which may adversely impact the company’s business in addition such incidents could result in unauthorized disclosure and misuse of material confidential information cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated are constantly evolving and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives and this increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them in addition data breaches or theft of personal information collected by the company and its thirdparty service providers as well as company information and assets may occur in the future the company is subject to the laws of various countries where it operates or does business related to solicitation collection processing transferring storing or use of consumer customer vendor or employee information or related data including the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which went into effect in may 2018 and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” which went into effect in january 2020 the changes introduced by the gdpr and the ccpa increase the complexity of regulations enacted to protect business and personal data and they subject the company to additional costs and have required and may in the future require costly changes to the company’s security systems policies procedures and practices 

    

a breach or other breakdown in the company’s technology including a cyberattack privacy breach data breach or other incident involving the company or any of the companys thirdparty service providers or vendors that results in unauthorized disclosure or significant unavailability of business financial personal or stakeholder information could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations in addition if the company’s service providers suppliers or customers experience a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in the company’s supply chain or reduced customer orders or other business operations which would adversely affect the company 

acquisitions new venture investments and divestitures may not be successful which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with the company’s strategy the company expects to continue to seek acquisition and investment opportunities however the company may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic transactions at attractive prices in addition an increase in regulatory restrictions or continued market volatility could hinder the company’s ability to execute strategic business activities including any acquisitions or investments furthermore all acquisitions and investments entail numerous risks including risks relating to the company’s ability to 

• successfully integrate acquired companies brands products technologies systems or personnel into the company’s existing business operations in an effective timely and cost efficient manner 

• maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies throughout acquired companies including effective integration of acquired companies into the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

• minimize any potential interruption to the ongoing business of the company or the acquired company 

• successfully enter categories and markets in which the company may have limited or no prior experience 

• achieve expected synergies and obtain the desired financial or strategic benefits from acquisitions within the anticipated time periods if at all 

• achieve distribution expansion related to products categories and markets from acquisitions 

• retain key relationships with employees customers partners and suppliers of acquired companies 

• identify and manage any legal or reputational risks that may predate or be associated with a transaction which could negatively impact the company following the consummation of such transaction and 

• manage other unanticipated problems or liabilities 

acquired companies or operations joint ventures or investments may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability and cash flow expectations furthermore acquisitions or ventures could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt the assumption of contingent liabilities such as those relating to advertising claims environmental issues and litigation an increase in expenses related to certain assets and increased operating expenses all of which could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would subject the company to local regulations and could potentially lead to risks related to among other things increased exposure to foreign exchange rate changes tax or labor laws government price control repatriation of profits and liabilities relating to the foreign corrupt practices act in addition to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the company’s acquisitions or investments diminish in the future whether or not related to the covid19 pandemic the company may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill intangible assets or other assets associated with such transactions which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 

the company has divested and may in the future divest certain assets businesses or brands that do not meet the company’s strategic objectives or growth targets with respect to any potential future divestiture the company may encounter difficulty finding potential acquirers or other divestiture options on favorable terms any future divestiture could affect the profitability of the company as a result of the gains or losses on such sale of a business or brand the loss of the operating income or sales resulting from such sale or the costs or liabilities that are not assumed by the acquirer that may negatively impact profitability and cash flow subsequent to any divestiture the company may also be required to recognize impairment charges or other losses as a result of a divestiture 

in addition any potential future acquisitions new ventures or divestitures may divert the attention of management and resources from other business priorities 

    

the occurrence of any of these risks or uncertainties with regard to any acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable worldwide regional and local economic and financial market conditions including the conditions resulting from the covid19 pandemic may negatively impact the company and consumers of its products which would negatively affect the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the global economy and the economies in regions in which the company conducts business have experienced substantial economic downturns as a result of the covid19 pandemic the company is currently experiencing reduced demand for certain of its consumer products and may in the future be adversely affected in a material way by lower consumer demand as a result of recessionary economic conditions including after the direct impact of the covid19 pandemic has subsided 

in response to unfavorable economic conditions including historically high unemployment rates in the us consumers may reduce discretionary spending which may lead to reduced net sales or cause a shift in the company’s product mix from highermargin to lowermargin products consumers may increase purchases of lowerpriced or “private label” products and the company’s competitors may increase levels of advertising and promotional activity for lowerpriced products as they seek to maintain sales volumes during uncertain economic times which may negatively impact the company’s net sales 

global markets continued to face threats and uncertainty during fiscal year 2020 future changes to us or foreign tax and trade policies imposition of new or increased tariffs other trade restrictions or other government actions including any government shutdown foreign currency fluctuations including devaluations and fear of exposure to or actual impacts of a widespread disease outbreak such as the covid19 pandemic may lead to continuation of such risks and uncertainty uncertain economic and financial market conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of the company’s customers suppliers and other business partners any significant decrease in customers’ purchases of the company’s products or inability of the company to collect accounts receivable resulting from an adverse impact of the global markets on customers’ financial condition could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

harm to the company’s reputation or the reputation of one or more of its leading brands or products could have an adverse effect on the business financial condition and results of operations 

maintaining a strong reputation with consumers customers and trade and other third party partners is critical to the success of the company’s business the company devotes significant time and resources to training programs that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to protect and preserve the company’s reputation and the reputation of its brands and products these training programs relate to among other things ethics compliance and product safety and quality as well as sustainability goals despite these efforts negative publicity about the company including product safety quality efficacy environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management and other sustainability or similar issues whether real or perceived could occur in addition the company’s products could face withdrawal recall or other quality issues which could lead to decreased demand for and sales of such products and harm the reputation of the related brands in particular the company’s dietary supplement and related products are highly dependent on consumers’ perception of the efficacy safety and quality of our products as well as similar products distributed by other companies and may be supported by only a limited number of conclusive clinical studies newly published clinical studies and emerging studies could prove or allege that ingredients in our dietary supplement products or the products themselves or similar products of other companies are ineffective or harmful to consumers the company also licenses certain of its brands to third parties and with the significant increase in demand for public disinfecting and cleaning products due to the covid19 pandemic the company has recently increased its focus on partnering with companies in industries involving shared space and may partner with other companies to provide disinfecting products and cleaning education and protocols and to leverage its related brands such licenses and partnerships may create additional exposure for those brands to product safety quality sustainability and other concerns 

in addition widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the accessibility and speed of dissemination of information negative publicity posts or comments by consumers competitors or others about the company its brands its products its marketing activities including whether or not it advertises through certain social media and networking sites its employees or its environmental social and governance practices whether accurate or inaccurate or disclosure of nonpublic sensitive information about the company could be widely disseminated through the use of social media or network sites or through other media or in other formats additionally marketing initiatives may not have the desired effect on a brand’s or product’s image 

such events if they were to occur could harm the company’s image and adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations as well as require resources to rebuild the company’s reputation 

    

government regulations could impose material costs 

generally the manufacture processing formulation packaging labeling storage distribution advertising and sale of the company’s products and the conduct of its business operations must comply with extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations for example in the us many of the company’s products are regulated by the environmental protection agency the food and drug administration including applicable current good manufacturing practice regulations andor the consumer product safety commission and the company’s product claims and advertising are regulated by the federal trade commission among other regulatory agencies additionally the company’s and its suppliers’ manufacturing and distribution operations are also subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies the company’s international operations are also subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products there is also an increased risk of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and related difficulties in maintaining effective internal controls additionally the company could be subject to future inquiries or investigations by governmental and other regulatory bodies which may be delayed or disrupted due to any government furlough any determination that the company’s operations or activities are not in compliance with applicable law could expose the company to future impairment charges or significant fines penalties or other sanctions that may result in a reduction in net income or otherwise adversely impact the business and reputation of the company 

in particular because of the company’s extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations or allegations of violations of the foreign corrupt practices act and similar international antibribery laws the foreign corrupt practices act and similar international antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls policies and procedures that mandate compliance with these antibribery and other laws will protect us from reckless intentional or unintentional criminal acts committed by our employees jointventure partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business financial condition and results of operations 

federal state and foreign governments may introduce new or expand existing legislation and regulations or courts or governmental authorities could impose more stringent interpretations of existing legislation and regulations affecting the company’s operations which may require the company to increase its resources capabilities and expertise in certain areas for example the company is subject to regulations regarding the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment including as a result of evolving climate change standards and regulations in other areas such as with respect to “conflict minerals” such regulations could negatively impact the company’s ability to obtain raw materials or could increase its acquisition and compliance costs furthermore additional legislation in the areas of healthcare reform taxation of domestic and foreign profits sustainability of packaging including plastic packaging executive compensation and corporate governance could also increase the company’s costs any future government shutdowns may result in delays in the acceptance review and approval of products or claims by the epa or other governmental agencies or other required governmental approvals and any significant tax reform including any increases in federal state or local corporate or business tax rates implemented by the current or future us federal state or local administrations may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition any additional or renewed significant governmental actions pertaining to the covid19 pandemic including lockdowns quarantines or other restrictions on the ability of the company’s employees to travel or perform necessary business functions or its ability to manufacture distribute market or sell its products or the ability of its suppliers customers or thirdparty partners to effectively run their operations may negatively impact the company’s ability to manufacture distribute market and sell its products 

the company is also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the united states and other jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage use transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer customer vendor or employee data such privacy and data protection laws and regulations including with respect to the gdpr and the ccpa and the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations are continuously developing and evolving and there is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with them the changes introduced by the gdpr and the ccpa as well as any other changes to existing privacy and data protection laws and regulations and the introduction of similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions have subjected and may continue in the future to subject the company to additional costs and have required and may in the future require costly changes to the company’s security systems policies procedures and practices the company’s efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws and regulations may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

    

if the company is found to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas it could be subject to governmental or regulatory actions including fines import detentions injunctions product withdrawals or recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations particularly with respect to its charcoal business could delay or prevent the company from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations in addition the company markets and sells products that are subject to regulations relating to dietary supplements in order to comply with any changes in these laws and regulations including any changes that result from newly published clinical studies and emerging studies that may assert or prove that ingredients in our products or our products themselves are ineffective or harmful to consumers the company may be required to make changes to product formulation labeling or marketing claims perform additional testing to substantiate its product claims make costly changes in its manufacturing processes or supply chain or stop selling certain products until corrective actions have been taken any of these developments could increase the company’s costs significantly which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

sales growth objectives may be difficult to achieve the company may not be able to successfully implement price increases and market and category declines and changes to the company’s product and geographic mix may adversely impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

a large percentage of the company’s revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition during fiscal year 2020 85 of the company’s net sales were attributable to us markets including us territories the company’s ability to achieve sales growth depends on its ability to drive growth through innovation including as part of its ignite strategy expand into new products and categories channels and countries invest in its established brands and enhanced merchandising grow categories with retailers and capture market share from competitors the company’s ability to achieve sales growth also depends on foreign currency fluctuations a weakening of foreign currencies in which sales are generated relative to the company’s reporting currency us dollars would decrease net sales the company has implemented price increases in the past and may implement price increases in the future which may slow sales growth or create volume declines in the short term as customers and consumers adjust to these price increases in addition our competitors may or may not take competitive actions which may lead to sales declines and loss of market share if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product innovations undertake sales marketing and advertising initiatives that grow its product categories andor develop acquire or successfully launch new products or brands it may not achieve its sales growth objectives furthermore a general decline in the markets for certain product categories has had and may in the future have a negative impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operation in addition changes to the mix of products that the company sells as well as the mix of countries in which its products are sold may adversely impact the company’s net sales profitability and cash flow 

volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials energy transportation labor and other necessary supplies or services have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the company’s net earnings and cash flow 

volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials including resin nonwoven fabrics for wipes products sodium hypochlorite corrugated cardboard soybean oil solvent derivatives of amines and other chemicals and agricultural commodities and increases in the cost of energy transportation labor and other necessary supplies or services have harmed and may continue to harm the company’s results of operation we distribute our products and receive raw materials primarily by rail and truck reduced availability of rail or trucking capacity has caused and could continue to cause us to incur unanticipated expenses in particular reduced trucking capacity due to shortages of drivers as a result of the covid19 pandemic and a federal regulation requiring drivers to electronically log their driving hours among other reasons have caused an increase in the cost of transportation for us and our suppliers the company believes commodity and other cost increases and volatility especially due to the covid19 pandemic could continue in the future if such increases occur or exceed the company’s estimates and the company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases its results of operation would be harmed in addition even if the company increases the prices of its products in response to increases in the cost of commodities or other cost increases it may not be able to sustain its price increases sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or customers may decide not to pay the higher prices which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share and the company’s projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations 

    

to reduce the cost volatility associated with anticipated purchases of certain commodities the company uses derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps the extent of the company’s derivative position at any given time depends on the company’s assessment of the markets for these commodities the cost volatility in the markets and the cost of the derivative instruments many of the commodities used by the company in its products do not have actively traded derivative instruments if the company does not or is unable to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if it executes a position and costs subsequently decrease the company’s costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than its competitors’ costs and the company’s financial results could be adversely affected for further information regarding the company’s use of derivative instruments see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in exhibit 991 

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations and international trade 

in fiscal year 2020 15 of the company’s net sales were attributable to international markets the company faces and will continue to face substantial risks associated with its foreign operations including the following 

• global or local economic or political instability 

• price controls and related government actions 

• foreign currency fluctuations including devaluations currency controls and inflation which may adversely affect the company’s ability to do business in certain markets and reduce the us dollar value of revenues profits or cash flows it generates in nonus markets 

• continued high levels of inflation in argentina 

• difficulty in obtaining nonlocal currency eg us dollars to pay for the raw materials needed to manufacture the company’s products and contractmanufactured products 

• restrictions on or costs related to the repatriation of foreign profits to the us 

• the imposition of tariffs trade restrictions price profit or other government controls labor laws immigration restrictions travel restrictions including as a result of covid19 or other pandemics or epidemics import and export laws or other government actions generating a negative impact on the company’s business including changes in trade policies that may be implemented and the impact of geopolitical events generally 

• difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified employees 

• civil unrest work stoppages labor disputes or widespread health emergencies such as covid19 or other pandemics or epidemics 

• employment litigation related to employees contractors and suppliers particularly in argentina 

• difficulties in obtaining or unavailability of raw materials including as a result of lower rates of production due to the covid19 pandemic or the financial condition of suppliers and distributors or restrictions on their operations 

• potential loss of distribution channels as a result of retailer consolidation 

• increased credit risk of customers suppliers and distributors and defaults on obligations of foreign governments 

• potential harm to third parties the company’s employees andor surrounding communities and related liabilities and damages to the company’s reputation from the use storage and transportation of chlorine in certain international markets where chlorine is used in the production of bleach whether such actions are undertaken by the company or by the company’s business partners 

• difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights 

• lack of wellestablished or reliable and impartial legal systems in certain countries where the company operates 

• challenges relating to enforcement of or compliance with local laws and regulations and with us laws affecting operations outside of the us including without limitation the foreign corrupt practices act 

• the possibility of nationalization expropriation of assets or other similar government actions and 

• risks related to natural disasters terrorism and other events beyond the company’s control 

    

in addition the impact of the united kingdom’s exit from and the related ongoing negotiations with the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” are at this time unclear brexit has created legal political and economic uncertainty which could subject the company to heightened risks in that region including disruptions to trade and free movement of goods services and people to and from the united kingdom disruptions to our workforce or the workforce of our suppliers or business partners and increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the british pound all of the foregoing risks could have a significant adverse impact on the company’s ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations the company’s small sales volume in some countries relative to some multinational and local competitors could exacerbate such risks 

the company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks with respect to its net sales net earnings and cash flow driven by movements of the us dollar relative to other currencies a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease net earnings and cash flow and  the company’s foreign currency hedges only offset a small portion of the company’s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations including devaluations therefore the company’s reported net earnings may be negatively affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 

furthermore the imposition of tariffs andor increases in tariffs on various products by the us and other countries has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies and government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries and new andor increased tariffs have subjected and may in the future subject the company to additional costs and expenditures of resources major developments in trade relations including the imposition of new or increased tariffs by the us andor other countries and any emerging nationalist trends in specific countries could alter the trade environment and consumer purchasing behavior that could have a material effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s international operations are also subject to uncertainties and risks associated with inflation for example effective july 1 2018 argentina was designated as a highly inflationary economy as it experienced cumulative inflation of approximately 100 percent or more over a threeyear period gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of nonus dollar monetary assets and liabilities of argentina were recorded in net earnings for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 in addition as of september 2019 the government of argentina reinstated foreign exchange controls in response to further decreases in the value of the argentine peso limiting the company’s ability to convert argentine pesos to us dollars and transfer us dollars outside of argentina the company expects further volatility and decreases in the value of the argentine peso in the future which may negatively impact the company’s business financial condition and results of operations other countries in which the company operates may also become highly inflationary andor such countries’ currencies may be devalued 

for further information regarding argentina including its designation as a highly inflationary economy see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the notes to consolidated financial statements in exhibit 991 

the facilities of the company and its suppliers are subject to disruption by events beyond the company’s control 

operations at facilities of the company its suppliers including solesource and singlesource suppliers service providers and retail customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages cyberattacks and other disruptions in information technology systems demonstrations disease outbreaks or pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic acts of war terrorism fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters disruptions in logistics loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites supplier capacity constraints raw material and product quality or safety issues industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues 

    

in particular the covid19 pandemic may negatively affect the company’s business by causing or contributing to significant disruptions to its manufacturing distribution and supply operations including closure of its significant manufacturing and distribution facilities such significant disruptions could be due to among other things the loss or disruption of the timely availability of adequate supplies of essential raw materials or other manufacturing components a decrease in the company’s workforce or in the efficiency of its workforce including as a result of illness to its employees or their families or governmental restrictions on its employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions or as a result of the need for the company to operate its business with substantial modifications to employee travel and employee work locations transportation and logistics challenges including as a result of port and border closures and other governmental restrictions and the availability and capacity of shipping channels as consumers may shift to increased online shopping and the loss or disruption of other manufacturing distribution and supply capabilities in addition substantial increases in demand in one or more products or brands beyond the company’s forecasts may require it to either expand its production capacity or acquire additional capacity both of which may require significant capital expenditures and may not be available on a timely basis 

the company’s corporate headquarters and primary research and development facility are located near major earthquake fault lines in california if a major disruption at the company or its suppliers were to occur it could result in injury to people damages to the natural environment temporary loss of access to critical data unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information delays in shipments of products to customers disruptions in the company’s supply chain or suspension of operations any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the company may not successfully achieve its innovation goals or develop and introduce new products and line extensions or expand into adjacent categories and countries which could adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s future performance and growth depends on innovation and its ability to successfully develop or license capabilities to introduce new products brands line extensions and product innovations or enter into or expand into adjacent product categories sales channels or countries the company’s ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and quickly innovate in order to adapt its products to meet changing consumer demands is essential especially in light of the reduction in barriers for even small competitors to quickly introduce new brands and products directly to consumers that ecommerce permits this risk is further heightened by the continued evolution of consumer needs habits and preferences as a result of shifts in us demographics reflecting various factors including cultural and socioeconomic changes 

the company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve its innovation goals the development and introduction of new products requires substantial and effective research and development and capital expenditures which the company may be unable to recoup if such new products do not gain widespread market acceptance in addition effective and integrated systems are required for the company to gather and use consumer data and information to successfully market its products new product development and marketing efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays which could result in the company not being first to market and the failure of new products brands and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance if product introductions or new or expanded product lines are not successful costs associated with these efforts may not be fully recouped and the company’s net earnings could be adversely affected in addition if sales generated by new products cause a decline in sales of the company’s existing products the company’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

product liability and labeling claims commercial claims or other legal proceedings could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

the company has in the past paid and may be required in the future to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products such claims may be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants or provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use have defective packaging fail to perform as advertised or damage property or persons product liability advertising and labeling claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation sales and results of operation and the reputation of the company’s brands furthermore acquisitions or ventures could also result in the assumption of contingent liabilities including litigation which could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations in addition if any of the company’s products is found to be defective the company may recall such products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses in july 2020 the company’s subsidiary in peru voluntarily recalled the poett ® dilutable cleaning products sold in peru which recall affects all such poett ® products manufactured in peru on or before june 30 2020 although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims may be subject to a deductible exceed the amount of insurance coverage or be excluded under the terms of the policies 

    

in addition the company is and may in the future become the subject of or party to various pending or threatened legal actions government investigations and proceedings relating to among other things advertising disputes with competitors consumer class actions including those related to advertising claims labor claims breach of contract claims antitrust litigation securities litigation premises liability claims data privacy and security disputes employment litigation related to employees contractors and suppliers including class action lawsuits and litigation in foreign jurisdictions such actions investigations and proceedings may or may not relate to the company’s responses to and actions taken in connection with the covid19 pandemic such as the company’s recently announced partnerships with companies in the industries involving sharedspace the company has been and may in the future be subject to additional claims proceedings and actions as it expands the products within the dietary supplements category in general claims made by or against the company in litigation investigations disputes or other proceedings have been and may in the future be expensive and timeconsuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements injunctions or damages that could significantly affect its business financial condition and results of operations and harm its reputation it is not possible to predict the final resolution of litigation investigations disputes or proceedings with which the company currently is or may in the future become involved and its assessment of the materiality of these matters and any reserves taken in connection therewith may not be consistent with their final resolutions the impact of these matters including any reserves taken in connection with such matters on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations could be material see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the notes to consolidated financial statements in exhibit 991 for additional information related to these matters

environmental matters create potential liabilities that could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to air emissions water discharges handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances and climate change the company has incurred and will continue to incur significant expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations and such expenditures reduce the cash flow available to the company for other purposes 

the company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its current and former facilities in addition some of its present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many years and over that time some of those facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that those sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom the company has sent waste may be identified and become the subject of remediation the company could also become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future whether as a result of new laws and regulations or otherwise that could result in a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations

the company also handles andor transports hazardous substances including but not limited to chlorine at some of its international production facilities a release of such chemicals whether in transit or at the company’s facilities due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability and business disruptions 

increased focus by governmental and nongovernmental organizations customers consumers and investors on sustainability issues including those related to climate change may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation 

as climate change land use water use deforestation plastic waste recyclability or recoverability of packaging including singleuse and other plastic packaging and other sustainability concerns become more prevalent governmental and nongovernmental organizations customers consumers and investors are increasingly focusing on these issues in particular changing consumer preferences may result in increased customer and consumer concerns and demands regarding plastics and packaging materials including singleuse and nonrecyclable plastic packaging and their environmental impact on sustainability a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredients or increased consumer concerns or perceptions whether accurate or inaccurate regarding the effects of ingredients or substances present in certain consumer products this increased focus on environmental issues and sustainability may result in new or increased regulations and customer consumer and investor demands that could cause us to incur additional costs or to make changes to our operations to comply with any such regulations and address demands if the company is unable to respond or perceived to be inadequately responding to sustainability concerns customers and consumers may choose to purchase products from another company or a competitor concern over climate change may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment increased costs of energy or compliance with emissions standards due to increased legal or regulatory requirements may cause disruptions in or increased costs associated with manufacturing our products any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or a perception whether or not valid of our failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to new or changes in legal or regulatory requirements concerning climate change or other sustainability concerns could adversely affect our business and reputation 

    

failure to effectively utilize successfully assert or successfully defend the company’s intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness 

the company relies on intellectual property rights based on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its brands products packaging for its products inventions and confidential information the company cannot be certain that it will be able to effectively utilize these intellectual property rights or that it can successfully assert or defend these rights there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions and product innovations the company cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be invalidated circumvented or challenged and the company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert its intellectual property rights or to defend those rights from assertions of invalidity in addition even if such rights are obtained in the us the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us it is also possible that the company’s brands may not be available for use in certain countries due to prior third party rights thereby limiting expansion of the company’s brands if other parties infringe the company’s intellectual property rights they may dilute or diminish the value of the company’s brands and products in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the company’s brands and harm its net sales the failure to perfect and protect its intellectual property rights could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations 

if the company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others its competitiveness could be negatively impacted 

if the company is found to have violated the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of thirdparty marks ideas or technologies such a finding could result in the need to cease use of such trademark trade secret copyrighted work or patented invention in the company’s business as well as the obligation to pay for past infringement if holders are willing to permit the company to continue to use such intellectual property rights they could require a payment of a substantial amount for continued use of those rights either ceasing use or paying such amounts could cause the company to become less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

even if the company is not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights claims of infringement could adversely affect the company’s business the company could incur material legal costs and related expenses to defend against such claims and the company could incur significant costs associated with suspending its use of the challenged intellectual property rights even if it is ultimately found not to have infringed such rights 

the company’s indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations and prevent the company from fulfilling its financial obligations and the company may not be able to maintain its current credit ratings may not continue to pay dividends or repurchase its stock and may not remain in compliance with existing debt covenants 

as of june 30 2020 the company had nearly 3 billion of debt the company’s indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

• require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness which would reduce the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital requirements capital expenditures future acquisitions dividends repurchase the company’s common stock and for other general corporate purposes 

• limit the company’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to general adverse economic conditions or changes in its business and the industries in which it operates 

• place the company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt and 

• limit along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the company’s debt documents its ability to borrow additional funds 

    

in addition the london interbank offered rate or libor the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate for certain borrowings under the company’s revolving credit facility and certain derivative instruments is expected to be phased out by the end of calendar year 2021 a reference rate based on the secured overnight financing rate or another alternative benchmark rate is expected to be established to replace libor although there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of june 30 2020 once the relevant administrator announces that libor has ceased or will cease to be available or the required lenders elect to optin early to a new reference rate the company and the lenders under the revolving credit facility will be required to mutually select a substitute reference rate and if such substitute reference rate or the replacement reference rate for our derivative instruments is higher than libor the company’s interest expense related to such borrowings may increase 

furthermore the company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions repurchase stock or fund other activities for general business purposes if new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that the company now faces could limit its ability to access the debt capital markets or other forms of financing and result in increased borrowing costs further certain terms of the agreements governing the company’s overthecounter derivative instruments contain provisions that require the company’s credit ratings as assigned by standard  poor’s and moody’s to the company to remain at a level equal to or better than the minimum of an investment grade credit rating as of june 30 2020 the company had been assigned investmentgrade ratings with both standard  poor’s and moody’s however if the company’s credit ratings were to fall below investment grade the counterparties to the derivative instruments in net liability positions could request full collateralization and it may negatively impact the company’s other financial arrangements 

the company has historically declared and paid quarterly cash dividends on its common stock and has been authorized to repurchase its stock subject to certain limitations under its stock repurchase programs any determinations by the board of directors to continue to declare and pay cash dividends on the company’s common stock or to repurchase the company’s common stock however will be based primarily upon the company’s financial condition results of operations and business requirements its access to debt capital markets or other forms of financing the price of its common stock in the case of the repurchase program and the board of directors’ continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration and payment of dividends are in the best interests of the company’s stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs in the event the company does not declare and pay a quarterly dividend or discontinues its stock repurchases the company’s stock price could be adversely affected the company is subject to compliance with the company’s existing debt covenants as of june 30 2020 although the company could add approximately 5 billion in incremental debt and remain in compliance with its debt covenants failure by the company to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in its debt documents could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company ’ s judgments regarding the accounting for tax positions the resolution of tax disputes and the effects of changes in tax rates and regulations on our business and our company could be materially different from our current estimates or expectations all of which could impact the companys net earnings and cash flow 

significant judgment is required to determine the company’s effective tax rate and evaluate its tax positions the company provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement criteria prescribed by applicable accounting standards when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved unfavorable resolution of any tax matter in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the effective tax rate which would have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 

fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties may also impact the company’s effective tax rate and the company’s results of operations and changes in tax laws such as the tax act which was signed into law in december 2017 could create uncertainty and have a material impact on the company’s results of operations while our accounting for the recorded impact of the tax act was deemed to be complete in the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2018 these amounts were based on prevailing regulations and currently available information and any additional guidance issued by the us treasury department or the us internal revenue service or any change in law or regulation could impact our recorded amounts in future periods

the company’s continued growth and expansion reliance on thirdparty service providers and implementation of new accounting standards could adversely affect its internal control over financial reporting which could harm its business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the company’s financial statements would be prevented or detected the company’s continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets may place significant additional pressure on the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting and require the company to update its internal control over financial reporting moreover the company engages the services of third parties to assist with business operations and financial reporting processes which injects additional monitoring obligations and risk into the system of internal control when the company is required to comply with new or revised accounting standards or implements changes to its external disclosure processes such as the recently implemented changes to the company’s reportable segment structure it must make any appropriate changes to its internal control over financial reporting to fully implement the standards or such changes which may require significant effort and judgment any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the company’s ability to report its results of operations accurately and on a timely basis or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose it to regulatory enforcement action and stockholder claims which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s business could be negatively impacted as a result of stockholder activism or an unsolicited takeover proposal or a proxy contest 

in recent years proxy contests and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies including the company during fiscal years 2012 and 2011 the company was the target of an unsolicited takeover proposal from a stockholder activist which resulted in significant costs to the company if such a proposal were to be made again the company would likely incur significant costs which could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations stockholder activists may also seek to involve themselves in the governance strategic direction and operations of the company through stockholder proposals or otherwise such proposals may disrupt the company’s business and divert the attention of the company’s management and employees and any perceived uncertainties as to the company’s future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities the perception that the company needs a change in the direction of its business or the perception that the company is unstable or lacks continuity which may be exploited by our competitors cause concern to our current or potential customers and make it more difficult for the company to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners which could adversely affect the company’s business in addition actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties set forth below as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report or in other filings by the company with the sec could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the company or that are not currently believed by the company to be material may also harm the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the company faces intense competition in its markets which could lead to reduced net sales net earnings and cash flow 

the company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the us and in its international markets most of the company’s products compete with other widely advertised promoted and merchandised brands within each product category the company also faces competition from retailers including club stores grocery stores drugstores dollar stores mass merchandisers ecommerce retailers and subscription services which are increasingly offering “private label” brands that are typically sold at lower prices and compete with the company’s products in certain categories increased purchases of “private label” products could reduce net sales of the company’s highermargin products or there could be a shift in product mix to lowermargin offerings which would negatively impact our margins 

the company’s products generally compete on the basis of product performance brand recognition and price advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have significant impacts on consumer purchasing decisions and the company is increasingly using digital media marketing and promotional programs to reach consumers a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it typically requires continued advertising promotional support and product innovations to maintain its relative market position if the company’s advertising marketing and promotional programs including its use of digital media to reach consumers are not effective or adequate the company’s net sales may be negatively impacted 

some of the company’s competitors are larger than the company and have greater financial resources these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the company can in addition the company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the company competitive activity may require the company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions andor reduce prices which could lead to reduced sales margins and net earnings 

the changing retail environment and changing consumer preferences could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s sales are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery mass retail outlet warehouse club and dollar store channels however alternative retail channels including ecommerce retailers hard discounters subscription services and buying clubs have become more prevalent and consumer products that are sold through such alternative retail channels are continuing to increase in addition a growing number of alternative sales channels and business models such as niche brands native online brands private label and store brands directtoconsumer brands and channels and discounter channels have emerged in the markets we serve in particular the growing presence of ecommerce retailers have affected and may continue to affect consumer preferences as consumers increasingly shop online and market dynamics further consumer preferences continue to evolve due to a number of factors including fragmentation of the consumer market and changes in consumer demographics including the aging of the general population and the emergence of millennial and younger generations who have different spending consumption and purchasing habits evolving consumer concerns or perceptions regarding packaging materials including plastic packaging and their environmental impact or sustainability a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredients and evolving consumer concerns or perceptions whether accurate or inaccurate regarding the effects of ingredients or substances present in certain consumer products if we are not successful in continuing to adapt to changing consumer preferences and market dynamics or expanding sales through ecommerce retailers hard discounters and other alternative retail channels our business financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted in addition the growth of the alternative retail channels that are focused on limiting the number of items they sell and selling predominantly “private label” products may reduce the company’s ability to market and sell its products through such retailers the retail environment is changing with the growth of ecommerce retailers hard discounters and other alternative retail channels and this could significantly change the way traditional retailers do business in addition these alternative retail channels may create significant pricing pressures for consumer goods presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases in all of the channels into which the company sells if these alternative retail channels were to take significant market share away from traditional retailers andor the company is not successful in these alternative retail channels our margins and results of operations may be materially and negatively impacted 

volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials energy transportation labor and other necessary supplies or services have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the company’s net earnings and cash flow 

volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials including resin sodium hypochlorite linerboard soybean oil solvent corrugated cardboard and other chemicals and agricultural commodities and increases in the cost of energy transportation labor and other necessary supplies or services have harmed and may continue to harm the company’s results of operation we distribute our products and receive raw materials primarily by rail and truck reduced availability of rail or trucking capacity has caused and could continue to cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and impair our ability to distribute our products or receive our raw materials in a timely manner which could disrupt our operations strain our customer relations and adversely affect our operating profits in particular reduced trucking capacity due to shortage of drivers an enforcement deadline for a federal regulation requiring drivers to electronically log their driving hours and adverse weather conditions among other reasons have caused an increase in the cost of transportation for us and many other companies the company believes commodity and other cost increases could continue in the future if such increases occur or exceed the company’s estimates and the company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases its results of operation will be harmed in addition even if the company increases the prices of its products in response to increases in the cost of commodities or other cost increases it may not be able to sustain its price increases sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or customers may decide not to pay the higher prices which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share while the company seeks to project tradeoffs between price increases and volume its projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations 

to reduce the cost volatility associated with anticipated purchases of certain commodities the company uses derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps the extent of the company’s derivative position at any given time depends on the company’s assessment of the markets for these commodities the cost volatility in the markets and the cost of the derivative instruments many of the commodities used by the company in its products do not have actively traded derivative instruments if the company does not or is unable to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if it executes a position and costs subsequently decrease the company’s costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than its competitors’ costs and the company’s financial results could be adversely affected for further information regarding the company’s use of derivative instruments see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in exhibit 991 

sales growth objectives may be difficult to achieve the company may not be able to successfully implement price increases and market and category declines and changes to the company’s product and geographic mix may adversely impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

a large percentage of the company’s revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition during fiscal year 2019  85 of the company’s net sales were generated in us markets including us territories the company’s ability to achieve sales growth depends on its ability to drive growth through innovation expand into new products and categories channels and countries invest in its established brands and enhanced merchandising grow categories with retailers and capture market share from competitors the company’s ability to achieve sales growth also depends on foreign currency fluctuations a weakening of foreign currencies in which sales are generated relative to the company’s reporting currency us dollars would decrease net sales the company has recently implemented price increases across a significant portion of its global portfolio which may slow sales growth or create volume declines in the short term as customers and consumers adjust to these price increases in addition our competitors may or may not take competitive actions which may lead to sales declines and loss of market share if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product innovations undertake sales marketing and advertising initiatives that grow its product categories andor develop acquire or successfully launch new products or brands it may not achieve its sales growth objectives even when the company is successful in increasing market share within particular product categories a decline in the markets for such product categories has had and can continue to have a negative impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operation in addition changes to the mix of products the company sells as well as the mix of countries in which its products are sold may adversely impact the company’s net sales profitability and cash flow 

dependence on key customers could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the company’s net sales net sales to the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates were 25  26 and 26 of consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended june 30 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively and occurred across all of the company’s reportable segments no other individual customer accounted for 10 or more of the company’s consolidated net sales in any of these fiscal years the company’s five largest customers accounted for nearly half of the company’s consolidated net sales for each of the fiscal years 2019  2018 and 2017 and a significant portion of the company’s future revenues may continue to be derived from a small number of customers as a result changes in the strategies of the company’s largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry a shift of shelf space to “private label” or competitors’ products or a decision to lower pricing of consumer products including branded products may harm the company’s net sales or margins and reduce the ability of the company to offer new innovative products to consumers in addition the use of the latest technology by our customers regarding pricing may lead to category pricing pressures furthermore any loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in net sales to a key customer even if such loss or reduction relates to a key customer of a business unit of the company could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders and the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its customers accordingly customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the company at any time and for any reason if the company does not effectively respond to the demands of its customers they could decrease their purchases from the company causing the company’s net sales and net earnings to decline furthermore unfavorable market conditions or competitive pressures may cause the company’s customers to reevaluate the number and mix of brands they sell resulting in lower purchases of the company’s products by these customers in addition some of our customers have experienced and may experience in the future declining financial performance which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all we regularly review the financial strength of our key customers and where appropriate modify customer credit limits which may have an adverse impact on future sales 

the company continues to see retailer consolidation both in the us and internationally this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailers who have in the past changed and may in the future change their business strategies demand lower pricing or special packaging or impose other burdensome requirements on product suppliers these business demands may relate to inventory practices transportation and storage a shift in focus away from branded products toward “private label” or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship these large consolidated companies could also exert additional competitive pressure on the company’s other customers which could in turn lead to such customers demanding lower pricing or special packaging or imposing other onerous requirements on the company if the company ceases doing business with a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease due to customer inventory reductions or otherwise the company’s business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or a failure of key information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operation and its reputation 

to conduct its business the company relies extensively on information technology systems many of which are managed hosted provided andor used by thirdparties and their vendors these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to communicating within the company and with customers consumers vendors investors and other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products receiving and processing purchase orders and shipping products to customers processing transactions storing processing and transmitting data including personal confidential information and payment card industry data hosting processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research business and financial information summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with financial reporting regulatory legal and tax requirements and implementing other processes involved in managing the business furthermore the company sells certain of its burt’s bees ® natural personal care products renewlife ® digestive health products and nutranext dietary supplements and other products directly to consumers online and through websites mobile apps and connected devices and the company offers promotions rebates customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information and the company or its vendors could experience cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or other incidents that may result in unauthorized access disclosure and misuse of consumer customer employee vendor or company information 

although the company continuously implements enterprisewide upgrades to its hardware software and operating systems the company continues to utilize various legacy systems which may be vulnerable to increased risks including the risk of system failures and disruptions in addition some of the legacy systems will need to be upgraded or replaced in the future as such systems cease to be supported by thirdparty service providers if such systems are not successfully upgraded or replaced in a timely manner system outages disruptions or delays or other issues may arise the company must also successfully integrate the technology systems of acquired companies into the company’s existing and future technology systems including with thirdparty service providers and processes if a new system does not function properly or is not adequately supported by thirdparty service providers and processes it could affect the company’s ability to process and deliver customer orders and process and receive payments for its products this could adversely impact the company’s results of operations and cash flows 

although the company has a broad array of network and information security measures in place and provides employee awareness regarding phishing malware and other cyber risks the information technology systems including those of our customers vendors suppliers and other thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted may be vulnerable to computer viruses or other malicious codes security breaches unauthorized access attempts phishing attacks and other disruptions from employee error unauthorized uses system failures including internet outages unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors or cyberattacks by hackers criminal groups nationstate organizations or socialactivist organizations the company cannot guarantee that its security efforts will prevent attacks and resulting breaches or breakdowns of the company’s or its thirdparty service providers’ databases or systems while the company has business continuity plans in place if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes including catastrophic events power outages security breaches cyberattacks or other similar events or as a result of legacy systems and if the business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm and litigation which may adversely impact the company’s business in addition such incidents could result in unauthorized disclosure and misuse of material confidential information cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated are constantly evolving and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives and this increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them in addition although the company has policies and procedures in place governing the secure storage of personal information collected by the company and its thirdparty service providers as well as protection of company information and assets data breaches or theft of such information assets may occur in the future the company is subject to laws of various countries where it operates or does business related to solicitation collection processing transferring storing or use of consumer customer vendor or employee information or related data including the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which went into effect in may 2018 and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” which goes into effect on january 1 2020 the changes introduced by the gdpr and the ccpa increase the complexity of regulations enacted to protect business and personal data and they subject the company to additional costs and have required and may in the future require costly changes to the company’s security systems policies procedures and practices 

a breach or other breakdown in the company’s technology including a cyberattack privacy breach data breach or other incident involving the company or any of the companys vendors that results in unauthorized disclosure or significant unavailability of business financial personal or stakeholder information could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations in addition if the company’s service providers suppliers or customers experience a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in the company’s supply chain or reduced customer orders or other business operations which would adversely affect the company 

harm to the company’s reputation or the reputation of one or more of its leading brands or products could have an adverse effect on the business financial condition and results of operations 

maintaining a strong reputation with consumers customers and trade partners is critical to the success of the company’s business the company devotes significant time and resources to programs that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to protect and preserve the company’s reputation and the reputation of its brands and products these programs include ethics and compliance the setting of sustainability goals and product safety and quality initiatives despite these efforts negative publicity about the company including product safety quality efficacy environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management and other sustainability or similar issues whether real or perceived could occur in addition the company’s products could face withdrawal recall other quality issues or decreased demand in particular the company’s dietary supplement and related products are highly dependent on consumers’ perception of the efficacy safety and quality of our products as well as similar products distributed by other companies and may be supported by only a limited number of conclusive clinical studies newly published clinical studies and emerging studies could prove or allege that ingredients in our dietary supplement products or the products themselves or similar products of other companies are ineffective or harmful to consumers the company also licenses certain of its brands to third parties which creates additional exposure for those brands to product safety quality sustainability and other concerns in addition widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the accessibility and speed of dissemination of information negative publicity posts or comments by consumers or competitors about the company its brands its products its marketing activities or its employees whether accurate or inaccurate or disclosure of nonpublic sensitive information about the company could be widely disseminated through the use of social media or network sites or through other media or in other formats such events if they were to occur could harm the company’s image and adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations as well as require resources to rebuild the company’s reputation 

acquisitions new venture investments and divestitures may not be successful which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with the company’s strategy the company expects to continue to seek acquisition opportunities however the company may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic acquisitions at attractive prices in addition all acquisitions and investments entail numerous risks including risks relating to the company’s ability to 

 acquired companies or operations or joint ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability and cash flow expectations furthermore acquisitions or ventures could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt the assumption of contingent liabilities such as those relating to advertising claims and other litigation an increase in expenses related to certain assets and increased operating expenses all of which could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would subject the company to local regulations and could potentially lead to risks related to among other things increased exposure to foreign exchange rate changes tax or labor laws government price control repatriation of profits and liabilities relating to the foreign corrupt practices act in addition to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the company’s acquisitions diminish in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill intangible assets or other assets associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 

the company has divested and may in the future divest certain assets businesses or brands that do not meet the company’s strategic objectives or growth targets with respect to any potential future divestiture the company may encounter difficulty finding potential acquirers or other divestiture options on favorable terms any future divestiture could affect the profitability of the company as a result of the gains or losses on such sale of a business or brand the loss of the operating income or sales resulting from such sale or the costs or liabilities that are not assumed by the acquirer that may negatively impact profitability and cash flow subsequent to any divestiture the company may also be required to recognize impairment charges or other losses as a result of a divestiture 

the occurrence of any of these risks or uncertainties with regard to any acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations in addition any potential future acquisitions new ventures or divestitures may divert the attention of management and resources from other business priorities 

government regulations could impose material costs 

generally the manufacture processing formulation packaging labeling storage distribution advertising and sale of the company’s products and the conduct of its business operations must comply with extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations for example in the us many of the company’s products are regulated by the environmental protection agency the food and drug administration including applicable current good manufacturing practice regulations andor the consumer product safety commission and the company’s product claims and advertising are regulated by the federal trade commission among other regulatory agencies most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies the company’s international operations are also subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products there is also an increased risk of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and related difficulties in maintaining effective internal controls additionally the company could be subject to future inquiries or investigations by governmental and other regulatory bodies any determination that the company’s operations or activities are not in compliance with applicable law could expose the company to future impairment charges or significant fines penalties or other sanctions that may result in a reduction in net income or otherwise adversely impact the business and reputation of the company 

in particular because of the company’s extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of the foreign corrupt practices act and similar international antibribery laws the foreign corrupt practices act and similar international antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees jointventure partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business financial condition and results of operations 

it is expected that federal state and foreign governments will continue to introduce new and expanded legislation affecting the company’s operations which may require the company to increase its resources capabilities and expertise in such areas for example the company is subject to regulations regarding the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment including as a result of evolving climate change standards and regulations in other areas such as with respect to “conflict minerals” such regulation could negatively impact the company’s ability to obtain raw materials or could increase its acquisition and compliance costs furthermore additional legislation in the areas of healthcare reform taxation of domestic and foreign profits sustainability of packaging including plastics executive compensation and corporate governance could also increase the company’s costs in addition any future government shutdowns may result in delays in the acceptance review and approval of products or claims by the epa or other governmental agencies or other required governmental approvals 

the company is also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the united states and other jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage use transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer customer vendor or employee data there is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations including with respect to the gdpr and the ccpa because they are continuously developing and evolving the changes introduced by the gdpr and the ccpa as well as any other changes to existing privacy and data protection laws and regulations and the introduction of similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions have subjected and may continue in the future to subject the company to additional costs and have required and may in the future require costly changes to the company’s security systems policies procedures and practices the company’s efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws and regulations may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time which could have a material effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

if the company is found to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas it could be subject to civil remedies including fines import detentions injunctions product withdrawals or recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations particularly with respect to its charcoal business could delay or prevent the company from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations as the company expands its natural personal care and healthcare businesses such as through burt’s bees ®  clorox healthcare ® and caltech industries an increasing number of its products have and will become subject to regulations and laws relating to drugs and medical devices in addition as a result of the company’s acquisition of renewlife and nutranext it markets and sells products that are subject to regulations relating to dietary supplements in order to comply with any changes in these laws and regulations including any changes that result from newly published clinical studies and emerging studies that may assert or prove that ingredients in our products or our products themselves are ineffective or harmful to consumers the company may be required to make changes to product formulation labeling or marketing claims perform additional testing to substantiate its product claims make costly changes in its manufacturing processes or supply chain or stop selling certain products until corrective actions have been taken any of these developments could increase the company’s costs significantly which could have a material effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

uncertain worldwide regional and local economic and financial market conditions may negatively impact the company and consumers of its products which would negatively affect the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

although the company continues to devote significant resources to support its brands uncertain economic conditions have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect consumer demand for the company’s products consumers may also be sensitive to economic uncertainty or unfavorable economic conditions and reduce discretionary spending which may lead to reduced net sales or cause a shift in the company’s product mix from highermargin to lowermargin products consumers may increase purchases of lowerpriced or “private label” products and the company’s competitors may increase levels of advertising and promotional activity for lowerpriced products as they seek to maintain sales volumes during uncertain economic times which may negatively impact the company’s net sales 

global markets continued to face threats and uncertainty during fiscal year 2019  future changes to us or foreign tax and trade policies imposition of new or increased tariffs other trade restrictions or other government actions including any government shutdown and foreign currency fluctuations including devaluations may lead to continuation of such threats and uncertainty uncertain economic and financial market conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of the company’s customers suppliers and other business partners any significant decrease in customers’ purchases of the company’s products or inability of the company to collect accounts receivable resulting from an adverse impact of the global markets on customers’ financial condition could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations and international trade including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and the imposition of new or additional tariffs 

in fiscal year 2019  15 of the company’s net sales were generated in international markets the company faces and will continue to face substantial risks associated with its foreign operations including the following 



 

in addition the ongoing negotiations surrounding the united kingdom’s exit from the european union “brexit” have yet to provide clarity on what the outcome will be for the united kingdom or europe changes related to brexit could subject the company to heightened risks in that region including disruptions to trade and free movement of goods services and people to and from the united kingdom disruptions to our workforce or the workforce of our suppliers or business partners increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the british pound and additional legal political and economic uncertainty all of the foregoing risks could have a significant adverse impact on the company’s ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations the company’s small sales volume in some countries relative to some multinational and local competitors could exacerbate such risks 

the company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks with respect to its net sales net earnings and cash flow driven by movements of the us dollar relative to other currencies a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease net earnings and cash flow although the company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks these hedges only offset a small portion of the company’s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations including devaluations therefore the company’s reported net earnings may be negatively affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 

furthermore the recent imposition of tariffs andor increase in tariffs on various products by the us and other countries have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies and government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries and new andor increased tariffs have subjected and may in the future subject the company to additional costs and expenditure of resources major developments in trade relations including the imposition of new or increased tariffs by the us andor other countries and any emerging nationalist trends in specific countries could alter the trade environment and consumer purchasing behavior which in turn could have a material effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

inflation is another risk associated with the company’s international operations for example effective july 1 2018 argentina was designated as a highly inflationary economy as it has experienced cumulative inflation of approximately 100 percent or more over a threeyear period gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of nonus dollar monetary assets and liabilities of argentina were recorded in net earnings for fiscal year 2019 other countries in which the company operates may also become highly inflationary or such countries’ currencies may be devalued or both which may negatively impact the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

for further information regarding argentina including the recent designation as a highly inflationary economy see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the notes to consolidated financial statements in exhibit 991 

the company may not successfully achieve its innovation goals or develop and introduce new products and line extensions or expand into adjacent categories and countries which could adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s future performance and growth depends on innovation and its ability to successfully develop or license capabilities to introduce new products brands line extensions and product innovations or enter into or expand into adjacent product categories sales channels or countries the company’s ability to quickly innovate in order to adapt its products to meet changing consumer demands is essential especially in light of ecommerce significantly reducing the barriers for even small competitors to quickly introduce new brands and products directly to consumers this risk is further heightened by the continued evolution of consumer needs habits and preferences as a result of shifts in us demographics reflecting various factors including cultural and socioeconomic changes 

the company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve its innovation goals the development and introduction of new products require substantial and effective research and development and demand creation expenditures which the company may be unable to recoup if such new products do not gain widespread market acceptance in addition effective and integrated systems are required for the company to gather and use consumer data and information to successfully market its products new product development and marketing efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays which could result in the company not being first to market and the failure of new products brands and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance if product introductions or new or expanded adjacencies are not successful costs associated with these efforts may not be fully recouped and the company’s net earnings could be adversely affected in addition if sales generated by new products cause a decline in sales of the company’s existing products the company’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

product liability and labeling claims commercial claims or other legal proceedings could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

the company has in the past paid and may be required in the future to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products such claims may be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants or provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use have defective packaging fail to perform as advertised or damage property or persons product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation sales and results of operation and the reputation of the company’s brands furthermore acquisitions or ventures could also result in the assumption of contingent liabilities including litigation which could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations in addition if any of the company’s products is found to be defective the company may recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage insurance recovery for product liability claims may be subject to a retention exceed the amount of insurance coverage or be excluded under the terms of the policies 

in addition the company is and may in the future become the subject of or party to various pending or threatened legal actions government investigations and proceedings including advertising disputes with competitors consumer class actions including those related to advertising claims labor claims breach of contract claims antitrust litigation securities litigation premises liability claims data privacy and security disputes employment litigation related to employees contractors and suppliers including class action lawsuits and litigation in foreign jurisdictions the company has been and may in the future be subject to additional claims proceedings and actions as it has entered and as it expands into the dietary supplements category in general claims made by or against the company in litigation investigations disputes or other proceedings have been and may in the future be expensive and timeconsuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements injunctions or damages that could significantly affect its business financial condition and results of operations and harm its reputation it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation investigations disputes or proceedings with which the company currently is or may in the future become involved the impact of these matters including any reserves taken in connection with such matters on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations could be material see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the notes to consolidated financial statements in exhibit 991 for additional information related to these matters 

profitability and cash flow could suffer if the company is unable to generate anticipated cost savings successfully implement its strategies or efficiently manage supply chain and manufacturing processes

failure to maximize successfully assert or successfully defend the company’s intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness 

the company relies on intellectual property rights based on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its brands products packaging for its products inventions and confidential information the company cannot be certain that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted or defended there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions and product innovations the company cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be invalidated circumvented or challenged and the company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert its intellectual property rights or to defend those rights from assertions of invalidity in addition even if such rights are obtained in the us the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us it is also possible that the company’s brands may not be available for use in certain countries due to prior third party rights thereby limiting expansion of the company’s brands if other parties infringe the company’s intellectual property rights they may dilute or diminish the value of the company’s brands and products in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the company’s brands and harm its net sales the failure to perfect and protect its intellectual property rights could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations 

if the company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others its competitiveness could be negatively impacted 

if the company is found to have violated the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of thirdparty marks ideas or technologies such a finding could result in the need to cease use of such trademark trade secret copyrighted work or patented invention in the company’s business as well as the obligation to pay for past infringement if holders are willing to permit the company to continue to use such intellectual property rights they could require a payment of a substantial amount for continued use of those rights either ceasing use or paying such amounts could cause the company to become less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations

the estimates and assumptions on which the company’s financial projections are based may prove to be inaccurate which may cause its actual results to materially differ from such projections which may adversely affect the company’s future profitability cash flows and stock price 

the company’s financial projections are dependent on certain estimates and assumptions related to among other things category growth development and launch of innovative new products market share projections product pricing volume and product mix foreign exchange rates and volatility commodity prices distribution cost savings accruals for estimated liabilities including litigation reserves measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans and the company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in its existing business fund internal growth repurchase its stock make acquisitions pay dividends and meet debt obligations while the company’s financial projections are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made the company’s actual results may differ materially from its financial projections any material variation between the company’s financial projections and its actual results may adversely affect the company’s future profitability cash flows and stock price 

the company’s indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations and prevent the company from fulfilling its financial obligations and the company may not be able to maintain its current credit ratings may not continue to pay dividends or repurchase its stock and may not remain in compliance with existing debt covenants 

as of june 30 2019  the company had over 2 billion of debt the company’s indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

 

the company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions repurchase stock or fund other activities for general business purposes if new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that the company now faces could limit its ability to access the debt capital markets or other forms of financing and result in increased borrowing costs further certain terms of the agreements governing the company’s overthecounter derivative instruments contain provisions that require the company’s credit ratings as assigned by standard  poor’s and moody’s to the company to remain at a level equal to or better than the minimum of an investment grade credit rating as of june 30 2019  the company had been assigned investmentgrade ratings with both standard  poor’s and moody’s however if the company’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade the counterparties to the derivative instruments in net liability positions could request full collateralization 

although the company has historically declared and paid quarterly cash dividends on its common stock and has been authorized to repurchase its stock subject to certain limitations under its stock repurchase programs any determinations by the board of directors to continue to declare and pay cash dividends on the company’s common stock or to repurchase the company’s common stock will be based primarily upon the company’s financial condition results of operations and business requirements its access to debt capital markets or other forms of financing the price of its common stock in the case of the repurchase program and the board of directors’ continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration and payment of dividends are in the best interests of the company’s stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs in the event the company does not declare and pay a quarterly dividend or discontinues its stock repurchases the company’s stock price could be adversely affected the company is subject to compliance with the company’s existing debt covenants as of june 30 2019  the company could add approximately 4 billion in incremental debt and remain in compliance with its debt covenants although the actual amount that the company may be able to borrow in the future may exceed this amount failure by the company to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in its debt documents could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company ’ s judgments regarding the accounting for tax positions the resolution of tax disputes and the effects of the tax act on our business and our company could be materially different from our current estimates or expectations all of which could impact the companys net earnings and cash flow 

significant judgment is required to determine the company’s effective tax rate and evaluate its tax positions the company provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement criteria prescribed by applicable accounting standards when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved unfavorable resolution of any tax matter in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the effective tax rate which would have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 

fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties may also impact the company’s effective tax rate and the company’s results of operations and changes in tax laws such as the tax act which was signed into law in december 2017 could create uncertainty and have a material impact on the company’s results of operations the tax act among other things significantly changed corporate taxation including by reducing the us corporation statutory income tax rate to 21 from 35 imposing a onetime taxation of accumulated foreign earnings regardless of whether they are repatriated placing limitations on the deduction for interest expense creating immediate tax deductions until january 1 2023 for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time disallowing deductions for certain performancebased compensation eliminating the deduction for certain domestic production activities and migrating from a “worldwide” system of taxation to a modified territorial system while our accounting for the recorded impact of the tax act is deemed to be complete these amounts are based on prevailing regulations and currently available information and any additional guidance issued by the internal revenue service could impact our recorded amounts in future periods

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties set forth below as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report or in other filings by the company with the sec could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the company or that are not currently believed by the company to be material may also harm the company’s business operations and financial results 

the company faces intense competition in its markets which could lead to reduced net sales net earnings and cash flow 

the company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the us and in its international markets most of the company’s products compete with other widely advertised brands within each product category the company also faces competition from retailers including club stores grocery stores dollar stores mass merchandisers ecommerce retailers and subscription services which are increasingly offering “private label” brands that are typically sold at lower prices and compete with the company’s products in certain categories increased purchases of “private label” products could reduce net sales of the company’s highermargin products or there could be a shift in product mix to lowermargin offerings which would negatively impact our margins 

the company’s products generally compete on the basis of product performance brand recognition and price advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have significant impacts on consumer purchasing decisions and the company is increasingly using digital media marketing and promotional programs to reach consumers a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it typically requires continued advertising promotional support and product innovations to maintain its relative market position if the company’s advertising marketing and promotional programs including its use of digital media to reach consumers are not effective or adequate the company’s net sales may be negatively impacted 

some of the company’s competitors are larger than the company and have greater financial resources these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the company can in addition the company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the company competitive activity may require the company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions andor reduce prices which could lead to reduced net earnings and adversely affect growth 

the changing retail environment could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s sales are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery mass retail outlet warehouse club and dollar store channels however alternative retail channels including ecommerce retailers hard discounters subscription services and buying clubs have become more prevalent and consumer products that are sold through such alternative retail channels are continuing to increase in particular the growing presence of ecommerce retailers have affected and may continue to affect consumer preferences and market dynamics although the company is engaged in ecommerce with respect to many of its products if we are not successful in adapting to the changing consumer preferences and market dynamics and expanding sales through ecommerce retailers hard discounters and other alternative retail channels our business financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted in addition the growth of the alternative retail channels that are focused on limiting the number of items they sell and selling predominantly private label products may reduce the companys ability to market and sell its products through such retailers the retail environment is changing with the growth of ecommerce retailers hard discounters and other alternative retail channels and this could significantly change the way traditional retailers do business in addition these alternative retail channels may create significant pricing pressures for consumer goods presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases in all of the channels into which the company sells if these alternative retail channels were to take significant market share away from traditional retailers andor the company is not successful in these alternative retail channels our margins and results of operations may be negatively impacted 

volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials energy transportation labor and other necessary supplies or services have negatively impacted and may negatively impact the company’s net earnings and cash flow 

volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials including resin sodium hypochlorite linerboard soybean oil solvent corrugated cardboard and other chemicals and agricultural commodities and increases in the cost of energy transportation labor and other necessary supplies or services have harmed and may continue to harm the company’s profits and operating results we distribute our products and receive raw materials primarily by rail and truck reduced availability of rail or trucking capacity has caused and could continue to cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and impair our ability to distribute our products or receive our raw materials in a timely manner which could disrupt our operations strain our customer relations and adversely affect our operating profits in particular the recent reduced trucking capacity due to shortage of drivers recent enforcement deadline for a federal regulation requiring drivers to electronically log their driving hours and adverse weather conditions among other reasons has caused an increase in the cost of transportation for us and many other companies the company believes commodity and other cost increases could continue in the future if such increases occur or exceed the company’s estimates and the company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases its profits and operating results will be harmed in addition even if the company increases the prices of its products in response to increases in the cost of commodities it may not be able to sustain its price increases sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or customers may decide not to pay the higher prices which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share while the company seeks to project tradeoffs between price increases and volume its projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 

to reduce the cost volatility associated with anticipated purchases of certain commodities the company uses derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps the extent of the company’s derivative position at any given time depends on the company’s assessment of the markets for these commodities the cost volatility in the markets and the cost of the derivative instruments many of the commodities used by the company in its products do not have actively traded derivative instruments if the company does not or is unable to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if it executes a position and costs subsequently decrease the company’s costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than its competitors’ costs and the company’s financial results could be adversely affected for further information regarding the company’s use of derivative instruments see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in exhibit 991 

sales growth objectives may be difficult to achieve the company may not be able to successfully implement price increases and market and category declines and changes to the company’s product and geographic mix may adversely impact the company’s financial results 

a large percentage of the company’s revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition during fiscal year 2018  84 of the company’s net sales were generated in us markets including us territories the company’s ability to achieve sales growth depends on its ability to drive growth through innovation expansion into new products and categories channels and countries investment in its established brands and enhanced merchandising and its ability to capture market share from competitors the companys ability to achieve sales growth also depends on foreign currency fluctuations a weakening of foreign currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease net sales the company has recently implemented price increases andor expects to implement price increases in fiscal year 2019 across a significant portion of its global portfolio which may slow sales growth or create volume declines in the short term as customers and consumers adjust to these price increases if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product innovations undertake sales marketing and advertising initiatives that grow its product categories andor develop acquire or successfully launch new products or brands it may not achieve its sales growth objectives even when the company is successful in increasing market share within particular product categories a decline in the markets for such product categories has had and can continue to have a negative impact on the company’s financial results in addition changes to the mix of products the company sells as well as the mix of countries in which its products are sold may adversely impact the company’s net sales profitability and cash flow 

dependence on key customers could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the company’s net sales net sales to the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates were 26  26  and 27  of consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended june 30 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively and occurred across all of the company’s reportable segments no other individual customer accounted for 10 or more of the companys consolidated net sales in any of these fiscal years the company’s five largest customers accounted for nearly half of the companys consolidated net sales for each of the fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  and a significant portion of the companys future revenues may continue to be derived from a small number of customers as a result changes in the strategies of the company’s largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry a shift of shelf space to “private label” or competitors’ products or a decision to lower pricing of consumer products including branded products may harm the company’s net sales or margins and reduce the ability of the company to offer new innovative products to consumers in addition the use of the latest technology by our customers regarding pricing may lead to category pricing pressures furthermore any loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in net sales to a key customer even if such loss or reduction relates to a key customer of a business unit of the company could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders and the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its customers accordingly customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the company at any time and for any reason if the company does not effectively respond to the demands of its customers they could decrease their purchases from the company causing the company’s net sales and net earnings to decline furthermore unfavorable market conditions or competitive pressures may cause the company’s customers to reevaluate the number and mix of brands they sell resulting in lower purchases of the company’s products by these customers in addition some of our customers have experienced and may experience in the future declining financial performance which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all we regularly review the financial strength of our key customers and where appropriate modify customer credit limits which may have an adverse impact on future sales 

the company continues to see retailer consolidation both in the us and internationally this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailers who have in the past changed and may in the future change their business strategies demand lower pricing or special packaging or impose other burdensome requirements on product suppliers these business demands may relate to inventory practices transportation and storage a shift in focus away from branded products toward “private label” or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship these large consolidated companies could also exert additional competitive pressure on the company’s other customers which could in turn lead to such customers demanding lower pricing or special packaging or imposing other onerous requirements on the company if the company ceases doing business with a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease due to customer inventory reductions or otherwise the company’s business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or a failure of key information technology systems could adversely impact the company’s business and reputation 

the company relies extensively on information technology systems many of which are managed hosted provided andor used by thirdparties and their vendors in order to conduct its business these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to communicating within the company and with customers consumers vendors investors and other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products receiving and processing purchase orders and shipping products to customers processing transactions hosting processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research business and financial information summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with financial reporting regulatory legal and tax requirements and implementing other processes involved in managing the business although the company has made progress with its implementation of enterprisewide upgrades to its hardware software and operating systems legacy systems which may be vulnerable to increased risk still remain in addition some of the legacy systems will need to be upgraded or replaced in the near future as such systems cease to be supported by thirdparty service providers if a new system does not function properly it could affect the companys ability to process and deliver customer orders and process and receive payments for its products this could adversely impact the companys results of operations and cash flows in addition if the technology systems of acquired companies including those of nutranext are not successfully integrated into those of the company or the companys existing andor future technology systems are not adequately supported by thirdparty service providers and processes the companys business may be adversely impacted 

although the company has a broad array of network and information security measures in place and provides employee awareness regarding phishing malware and other cyber risks the information technology systems including those of our customers vendors suppliers and other thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted may be vulnerable to computer viruses or other malicious codes security breaches unauthorized access attempts phishing attacks and other disruptions from employee error unauthorized uses or system failures including internet outages while the company has business continuity plans in place if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes including catastrophic events power outages security breaches cyberattacks or other similar events or as a result of legacy systems and if the business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm and litigation which may adversely impact the company’s business in addition such incidents could result in unauthorized disclosure and misuse of material confidential information the company cannot guarantee that its security efforts will prevent attacks and resulting breaches or breakdowns of the companys or its thirdparty service providers databases or systems cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated and constantly evolving and this increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them in addition although the company has policies and procedures in place governing the secure storage of personal information collected by the company and its thirdparty service providers as well as protection of company information and assets data breaches or theft of such information assets may occur in the future furthermore the company sells its burt’s bees ®  natural personal care products renewlife ®  digestive health products nutranext dietary supplements and other products directly to consumers online and through websites mobile apps and connected devices and the company offers promotions rebates customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information and it or its vendors could experience cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or other incidents that may result in unauthorized disclosure and misuse of consumer customer employee vendor or company information the company is subject to laws of various countries where it operates or does business related to solicitation collection processing or use of consumer customer vendor or employee information or related data including the european unions general data protection regulation which recently went into effect 

if the company suffers a loss as a result of a breach or other breakdown in its technology including cyberattack privacy breaches data breaches or other incident involving the company or any of the company’s vendors that result in unauthorized disclosure or significant unavailability of business financial personal or stakeholder information the companys reputation competitiveness andor business may be harmed and the company may be exposed to legal liability and be subject to government investigations which may adversely affect the company’s results of operations andor financial condition in addition if the company’s service providers suppliers or customers experience a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in the company’s supply chain or reduced customer orders or other business operations which would adversely affect the company 

harm to the company’s reputation or the reputation of one or more of its leading brands could have an adverse effect on the business 

maintaining a strong reputation with consumers customers and trade partners is critical to the success of the company’s business the company devotes significant time and resources to programs that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to protect and preserve the company’s reputation and the reputation of its brands these programs include ethics and compliance setting sustainability goals and product safety and quality initiatives despite these efforts negative publicity about the company including product safety quality efficacy environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management and other sustainability or similar issues whether real or perceived could occur and the company may not meet its sustainability goals as a result the company’s products could face withdrawal recall or other quality issues the company also licenses certain of its brands to third parties which creates additional exposure for those brands to product safety quality sustainability and other concerns in addition widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination negative publicity posts or comments on social media or network sites about the company or its brands whether accurate or inaccurate or disclosure of nonpublic sensitive information about the company could be widely disseminated through the use of social media such events if they were to occur could harm the company’s image and adversely affect its business as well as require resources to rebuild the company’s reputation 

acquisitions new venture investments and divestitures may not be successful which could impact the company’s business operations and financial results 

in connection with the company’s strategy the company expects to continue to seek acquisition opportunities such as the fiscal year 2018 acquisition of nutranext which competes in the dietary supplements category however the company may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic acquisitions at attractive prices in addition all acquisitions and investments entail numerous risks including risks relating to the company’s ability to 

 acquired companies or operations or joint ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability and cash flow expectations future acquisitions or ventures could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt the assumption of contingent liabilities including litigation an increase in expenses related to certain assets and increased operating expenses all of which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would subject the company to local regulations and could potentially lead to risks related to among other things increased exposure to foreign exchange rate changes tax or labor laws government price control repatriation of profits and liabilities relating to the foreign corrupt practices act in addition to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the company’s acquisitions diminish in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill intangible assets or other assets associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect its operating results andor net earnings per share 

the company has divested and may in the future divest certain assets businesses or brands that do not meet the company’s strategic objectives or growth targets with respect to any potential future divestiture the company may encounter difficulty finding potential acquirers or other divestiture options on favorable terms any future divestiture could affect the profitability of the company as a result of the gains or losses on such sale of a business or brand the loss of the operating income or sales resulting from such sale or the costs or liabilities that are not assumed by the acquirer that may negatively impact profitability and cash flow subsequent to any divestiture the company may also be required to recognize impairment charges as a result of a divestiture 

in addition any potential future acquisitions new ventures or divestitures may divert the attention of management and resources from matters that are core or critical to the company’s business 

government regulations could impose material costs 

generally the manufacture packaging labeling storage distribution advertising and sale of the company’s products and the conduct of its business operations must all comply with extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations for example in the us many of the company’s products are regulated by the environmental protection agency the food and drug administration including applicable current good manufacturing practice regulations andor the consumer product safety commission and the company’s product claims and advertising are regulated by the federal trade commission among other regulatory agencies most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies the company’s international operations are also subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products there is also a risk of potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and related difficulties in maintaining effective internal controls additionally the company could be subject to inquiries or investigations by governmental and other regulatory bodies any determination that the company’s operations or activities are not in compliance with applicable law could expose the company to future impairment charges or significant fines penalties or other sanctions that may result in a reduction in net income or otherwise adversely impact the business and reputation of the company 

in particular because of the company’s extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of the foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws the foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees jointventure partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

it is expected that federal state and foreign governments will continue to introduce new and expanded legislation affecting the company’s operations which may require the company to increase its resources capabilities and expertise in such areas for example the company is subject to regulations regarding the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment including as a result of evolving climate change standards and regulations in other areas such as with respect to “conflict minerals” such regulation could negatively impact the company’s ability to obtain raw materials or could increase its acquisition and compliance costs in addition the company is subject to laws of various countries where it operates or does business related to solicitation collection processing or use of consumer customer vendor or employee information or related data including the european unions general data protection regulation furthermore additional legislation in the areas of healthcare reform taxation of domestic and foreign profits executive compensation and corporate governance could also increase the company’s costs these risks may be increased by the company’s acquisition of nutranext and renewlife which manufactures products subject to additional regulations such as those under the dietary supplement health and education act 

additionally the recent imposition of tariffs on products imported from certain countries have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies and government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries major developments in trade relations including the imposition of new or increased tariffs by the us andor other countries and any emerging nationalist trends in specific countries could alter the trade environment and consumer purchasing behavior which in turn could have a material effect on our balance sheet and results of operations 

if the company is found to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas including the evolving regulations related to privacy and data security and protection it could be subject to civil remedies including fines import detentions injunctions product withdrawals or recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations particularly with respect to its charcoal business could delay or prevent the company from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results as the company expands its natural personal care and healthcare businesses such as through burt’s bees ®  healthlink ®  and caltech industries an increasing number of its products have and will become subject to regulations and laws relating to drugs and medical devices in addition as a result of the companys acquisition of renewlife and nutranext it markets and sells products that are subject to regulations relating to dietary supplements in order to comply with these laws and regulations the company may be required to make changes to product formulation labeling or marketing claims perform additional testing to substantiate its product claims make costly changes in its manufacturing processes or supply chain or stop selling certain products until corrective actions have been taken 

uncertain worldwide regional and local economic and financial market conditions may negatively impact the company and consumers of its products which would negatively affect the company’s financial performance and liquidity 

although the company continues to devote significant resources to support its brands uncertain economic conditions have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect consumer demand for the company’s products consumers may also be sensitive to economic uncertainty or unfavorable economic conditions and reduce discretionary spending which may lead to reduced net sales or cause a shift in the company’s product mix from highermargin to lowermargin products consumers may increase purchases of lowerpriced or “private label” products and the company’s competitors may increase levels of advertising and promotional activity for lowerpriced products as they seek to maintain sales volumes during uncertain economic times which may negatively impact the company’s net sales 

global markets continued to face threats and uncertainty during fiscal year 2018  future changes to us or foreign tax and trade policies imposition of new or increased tariffs other trade restrictions or other government actions and foreign currency fluctuations including devaluations may lead to continuation of such threats and uncertainty uncertain economic and financial market conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of the company’s customers suppliers and other business partners if customers’ financial conditions are adversely affected customers may reduce their purchases of the company’s products or the company may not be able to collect accounts receivable each of which could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business operations or financial results 

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations and international trade 

in fiscal year 2018  16 of the company’s net sales were generated in international markets the company faces and will continue to face substantial risks associated with its foreign operations including the following 

 

in addition changes as result of the united kingdoms decision to exit the european union could subject the company to heightened risks in that region including disruptions to trade and free movement of goods services and people to and from the united kingdom increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the british pound and additional legal and economic uncertainty all of the foregoing risks could have a significant adverse impact on the company’s ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition the company’s small sales volume in some countries relative to some multinational and local competitors could exacerbate such risks 

the company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks with respect to its net sales net earnings and cash flow driven by movements of the us dollar relative to other currencies a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease net earnings and cash flow although the company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks these hedges only offset a small portion of the company’s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations including devaluations therefore the company’s reported net earnings may be negatively affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 

inflation is another risk associated with the company’s international operations for example effective july 1 2018 argentina has been designated as a highly inflationary economy as it has experienced cumulative inflation of approximately 100 percent or more over a threeyear period gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of nonus dollar monetary assets and liabilities of argentina will be recorded in net earnings for the first quarter of the companys fiscal year ending june 30 2019 other countries in which the company operates may also become highly inflationary or such countries’ currencies may be devalued or both which may negatively impact the company’s business operations and financial results 

for further information regarding argentina including the recent designation as a highly inflationary economy see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in exhibit 991 

the company may not successfully achieve its innovation goals or develop and introduce new products and line extensions or expand into adjacent categories and countries which could adversely impact its financial results 

the company’s future performance and growth depends on innovation and its ability to successfully develop or license capabilities to introduce new products brands line extensions and product innovations or enter into or expand into adjacent product categories sales channels or countries the companys ability to quickly innovate in order to adapt its products to meet changing consumer demands is essential especially in light of ecommerce significantly reducing the barriers for even small competitors to quickly introduce new brands and products directly to consumers this risk is further heightened by the continued evolution of consumer needs habits and preferences as a result of shifts in us demographics reflecting various factors including cultural and socioeconomic changes the company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve its innovation goals the development and introduction of new products require substantial and effective research and development and demand creation expenditures which the company may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance in addition effective and integrated systems are required for the company to gather and use consumer data and information to successfully market its products new product development and marketing efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays which could result in the company not being first to market and the failure of new products brands and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance if product introductions or new or expanded adjacencies are not successful costs associated with these efforts may not be fully recouped and the company’s net earnings could be adversely affected in addition if sales generated by new products cause a decline in sales of the company’s existing products the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

product liability and labeling claims commercial claims or other legal proceedings could adversely affect the company’s net sales and operating results including cash flow 

the company has in the past paid and may be required in the future to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products such claims may be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants or provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use have defective packaging fail to perform as advertised or damage property or persons product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation sales and operating results and the reputation of the companys brands furthermore acquisitions or ventures could also result in the assumption of contingent liabilities including litigation which could adversely affect the companys results of operations and financial condition in addition if any of the company’s products is found to be defective the company may recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage insurance recovery for product liability claims may be subject to a retention exceed the amount of insurance coverage or be excluded under the terms of the policies 

in addition the company is and may in the future become the subject of or party to various pending or threatened legal actions government investigations and proceedings  including advertising disputes with competitors consumer class actions including those related to advertising claims labor claims breach of contract claims antitrust litigation securities litigation premises liability claims and litigation in foreign jurisdictions the company may be subject to additional claims proceedings and actions as it expands into dietary supplements category in general claims made by or against the company in litigation investigations disputes or other proceedings have been and may in the future be expensive and timeconsuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements injunctions or damages that could significantly affect its business or financial results or condition it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation investigations disputes or proceedings with which the company currently is or may in the future become involved the impact of these matters on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition could be material see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the notes to consolidated financial statements in exhibit 991 for additional information related to these matters 

profitability and cash flow could suffer if the company is unable to generate anticipated cost savings successfully implement its strategies or efficiently manage supply chain and manufacturing processes 

the company continues to implement plans to improve its competitive position by setting aggressive annual cost savings targets and it expects ongoing cost savings from its continuous improvement activities the company anticipates these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing inefficiencies and realizing productivity gains distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions if the company cannot successfully implement its cost savings plans or the cost of making these changes increases the company may not realize all anticipated benefits which could adversely affect its financial results or its longterm strategies such as the 2020 strategy which includes financial goals such as annual net sales growth of 35 annual ebit margin growth between 2550 basis points and annual free cash flow as a percentage of net sales of about 1113 the company also continues to seek to penetrate new markets and introduce new products and product innovations these goals and strategies may not be implemented or may fail to achieve desired results and the company may fail to achieve one or more of the financial goals for one or more of the relevant fiscal years in addition the company expects to continue to restructure its operations as necessary to improve operational efficiency including occasionally opening or closing offices facilities or plants gaining additional efficiencies may become increasingly difficult over time there may be onetime costs relating to facility closures or other restructurings and anticipated cost savings and the company’s strategies may not be implemented or may fail to achieve desired results if the company is unable to generate anticipated costs savings successfully implement its strategies or efficiently manage its supply chain and manufacturing processes the company’s financial results could suffer these plans and strategies could also have a negative impact on the company’s relationships with employees or customers which could also adversely affect the company’s financial results 

increases in the estimated fair value of the procter  gamble co pgs interest in the company’s glad ®  business such as the significant increase over the first half of fiscal year 2018 due to the enactment of hr 1 also known as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act and the extension of the venture agreement with and the related rd support provided by pg increase the value of the company’s obligation to purchase pg’s interest in the glad ®  business upon the termination of the venture agreement and may in the future adversely affect the company’s net earnings and cash flow

loss of or inability to attract key personnel could adversely impact the company’s business 

the company’s success depends in part on its ability to retain its key personnel including its executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of one or more of the company’s key employees could disrupt its business the company’s success also depends in part on its continuing ability to identify hire develop and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense especially in the san francisco bay area where the company’s headquarters and largest research facility are located in addition the companys employees may be targeted and recruited by other companies as the company expands into new categories or markets including more regulated businesses it will also require personnel with relevant training and experience in such categories or markets the company may not be able to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future and its failure to do so or the compensation costs of doing so could adversely affect the company 

reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in disruptions to the company’s business 

the company relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain commodities and raw material inputs including solesource and singlesource suppliers for certain of its raw materials packaging product components finished products and other necessary supplies new suppliers have to be qualified under company standards and may also have to be qualified under governmental and industry standards and any relevant standards of the companys customers which may require additional investment and time the company could experience disruptions in production and other supply chain issues which could result in outofstock conditions and its financial results and relationships with customers could be adversely affected if the company is unable to qualify any needed new suppliers or maintain supplier arrangements and relationships if it is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity quality and price levels needed for its business if any of the company’s key suppliers becomes insolvent or experiences financial distress or if any environmental economic or other outside factors impact its operations 

environmental matters create potential liabilities that could adversely affect the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to air emissions water discharges handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances and climate change the company has incurred and will continue to incur significant expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations and such expenditures reduce the cash flow available to the company for other purposes 

the company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its current and former facilities in addition some of its present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many years and over that time some of those facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that those sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom the company has sent waste may be identified and become the subject of remediation the company could also become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 

the company had a recorded liability of 28 million as of june 30 2018  and 2017  for its share of aggregate future remediation costs related to certain environmental matters including response actions at various locations one matter which accounted for 14 million of the recorded liability as of june 30 2018 and 2017 relates to environmental costs associated with one of the company’s former operations at a site located in alameda county california another matter in dickinson county michigan for which the company is jointly and severally liable accounted for 12 million of the recorded liability as of june 30 2018  and 2017  the company’s estimated losses related to these matters are sensitive to a variety of uncertain factors including the efficacy of any remediation efforts changes in any remediation requirements and the future availability of alternative cleanup technologies and the company’s exposure may exceed the amount recorded for these matters see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the notes to consolidated financial statements in exhibit 991 for additional information related to these liabilities 

the company also handles andor transports hazardous substances including but not limited to chlorine at some of its international production facilities a release of such chemicals whether in transit or at the company’s facilities due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability and business disruptions 

the facilities of the company and its suppliers are subject to disruption by events beyond the company’s control 

operations at facilities of the company its suppliers including solesource and singlesource suppliers service providers and retail customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages demonstrations disease outbreaks or pandemics acts of war terrorism fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters disruptions in logistics loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites supplier capacity constraints raw material and product quality or safety issues industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues the company’s corporate headquarters and primary research and development facility are located near major earthquake fault lines in california if a major disruption at the company or its suppliers were to occur it could result in injury to people damages to the natural environment temporary loss of access to critical data delays in shipments of products to customers disruptions in the companys supply chain or suspension of operations any such disruption could have a material adverse impact on the company and its financial results 

failure to maximize successfully assert or successfully defend the company’s intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness 

the company relies on intellectual property rights based on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its brands products packaging for its products inventions and confidential information the company cannot be certain that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions and product innovations the company cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be invalidated circumvented or challenged and the company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert its intellectual property rights or to defend those rights from assertions of invalidity in addition even if such rights are obtained in the us the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us it is also possible that the company’s brands may not be available for use in certain countries due to prior third party rights thereby limiting expansion of the companys brands if other parties infringe the company’s intellectual property rights they may dilute or diminish the value of the company’s brands and products in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the company’s brands and harm its net sales the failure to perfect and protect its intellectual property rights could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

if the company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others its competitiveness could be negatively impacted 

if the company is found to have violated the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of thirdparty marks ideas or technologies such a finding could result in the need to cease use of such trademark trade secret copyrighted work or patented invention in the company’s business and the obligation to pay for past infringement if holders are willing to permit the company to continue to use such intellectual property rights they could require a payment of a substantial amount for continued use of those rights either ceasing use or paying such amounts could cause the company to become less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

even if the company is not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights claims of infringement could adversely affect the company’s business the company could incur material legal costs and related expenses to defend against such claims and the company could incur significant costs associated with discontinuing to use provide or manufacture certain products services or trademarks even if it is ultimately found not to have infringed such rights 

the companys judgments regarding the accounting for tax positions the resolution of tax disputes and the effects of the tax act on our business and our company could be materially different from our current estimates or expectations all of which could impact the companys net earnings and cash flow 

significant judgment is required to determine the company’s effective tax rate and evaluate its tax positions the company provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement criteria prescribed by applicable accounting standards when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved unfavorable resolution of any tax matter in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the effective tax rate which would have an adverse effect on the company’s operating results any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 

fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties may also impact the company’s effective tax rate and the company’s financial results and changes in tax laws such as the tax act which was signed into law on december 22 2017 could create uncertainty and have a material impact the company’s operating results the tax act among other things contains significant changes to corporate taxation including a reduction of the us corporation statutory income tax rate to 21 from 35 onetime taxation of accumulated foreign earnings regardless of whether they are repatriated limitations on the deduction for interest expense immediate tax deductions for five years for new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time disallowance of deductions for certainperformance based compensation elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities and a migration from a “worldwide” system of taxation to a modified territorial system although we continue to assess and analyze the full effects of the tax act on our business and the company we expect the tax act as a whole will reduce our effective tax rate in future periods in addition to fiscal year 2018 in addition although we expect a positive impact to our cash flows from the tax act such impact will be realized in future periods as we realize the benefit from the lower effective tax rates 

we are continuing to assess and analyze the accounting for the impacts of the tax act moreover the process of adopting extensive tax legislation in a short amount of time may have led to drafting errors issues needing clarification and unintended consequences that congress may decide to review in subsequent tax legislation in addition interpretation of many provisions of the tax act is still unclear it is not clear when or whether congress may address any of these issues or when the internal revenue service may issue additional administrative guidance on the changes made in the tax act in addition the fasb provided guidance intended to clarify the accounting for certain aspects of the tax act furthermore foreign countries may decide to enact tax laws that may negatively affect our foreign tax liabilities in retaliation for any real or perceived negative effects of the tax act on their countries that they deem unfair or for other reasons andor states or local government may decide to enact tax laws that may increase tax liabilities for companies doing business in such jurisdictions as they see opportunities to increase state and local corporate taxes after the federal corporate tax rate was reduced by the tax act 

we continue to assess and analyze the impact of the tax act on our business and our company accordingly some of the income tax effects reflected in our consolidated financial statements are provisional amounts for example provisional amounts are reported for our revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities and for our onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings in addition certain underlying income tax effects embedded within the valuations of certain balance sheet items including the liability related to our obligation to purchase pg’s 20 interest in our glad ®  business upon the termination of our venture agreement with pg may be subject to change as we finalize the provisional elements in our assessment of the tax act the estimated impacts of the tax act including with respect to our revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities assessment of our deferred taxes related to foreign unremitted earnings estimate of our effective tax rates for future periods and valuation of our potential obligation to purchase pg’s interest in our glad ®  business are based on management’s current assessment and estimates and could be materially different based on our actual results for future periods our further analysis of the tax act any additional congressional administrative and fasb actions or guidance related to the tax act and any actions that we may take as a result of the tax act for additional information see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the company’s indebtedness could adversely affect its business operations and financial results and prevent the company from fulfilling its obligations and the company may not be able to maintain its current credit ratings may not continue to pay dividends or repurchase its stock and may not remain in compliance with existing debt covenants 

as of june 30 2018  the company had over 2 billion of debt the company’s indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

 the company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions repurchase stock or fund other activities for general business purposes if new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that the company now faces could limit its ability to access debt capital markets or other forms of financing and result in increased borrowing costs further certain terms of the agreements governing the company’s overthecounter derivative instruments contain provisions that require the company’s credit ratings as assigned by standard  poor’s and moody’s to the company to remain at a level equal to or better than the minimum of an investment grade credit rating as of june 30 2018  the company had been assigned investmentgrade ratings with both standard  poor’s and moody’s however if the company’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade the counterparties to the derivative instruments in net liability positions could request full collateralization 

although the company has historically declared and paid quarterly cash dividends on its common stock and has been authorized to repurchase its stock subject to certain limitations under its stock repurchase programs any determinations by the board of directors to continue to declare and pay cash dividends on the company’s common stock or to repurchase the company’s common stock will be based primarily upon the company’s financial condition results of operations and business requirements its access to debt capital markets or other forms of financing the price of its common stock in the case of the repurchase program and the board of directors’ continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration and payment of dividends are in the best interests of the company’s stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs in the event the company does not declare and pay a quarterly dividend or discontinues its stock repurchases the company’s stock price could be adversely affected the company is subject to compliance with the company’s existing debt covenants as of june 30 2018  the company could add approximately 4 billion in incremental debt and remain in compliance with its debt covenants although the actual amount that the company may be able to borrow in the future may exceed this amount failure by the company to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in its debt documents could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could have a significant adverse effect on the company 

the company’s continued growth and expansion and reliance on thirdparty service providers could adversely affect its internal control over financial reporting which could harm its business and financial results 

clorox management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the company’s financial statements would be prevented or detected the company’s continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets such as its acquisition of nutranext and renewlife may place significant additional pressure on the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting and require the company to update its internal control over financial reporting to integrate such acquisitions moreover the company engages the services of third parties to assist with business operations and financial reporting processes which injects additional monitoring obligations and risk into the system of internal control any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the company’s ability to report its financial results accurately and on a timely basis or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose it to regulatory enforcement action and shareholder claims 

the company’s business could be negatively impacted as a result of stockholder activism or an unsolicited takeover proposal or a proxy contest 

in recent years proxy contests and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies including the company during fiscal years 2012 and 2011 the company was the target of an unsolicited takeover proposal from a stockholder activist which resulted in significant costs to the company if such a proposal were to be made again the company would incur significant costs which would have an adverse effect on the company’s financial results stockholder activists may also seek to involve themselves in the governance strategic direction and operations of the company such proposals may disrupt the company’s business and divert the attention of the company’s management and employees and any perceived uncertainties as to the company’s future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities the perception that the company needs a change in the direction of its business or the perception that the company is unstable or lacks continuity which may be exploited by our competitors cause concern to our current or potential customers and may make it more difficult for the company to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners which could adversely affect the company’s business in addition actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business 

the estimates and assumptions on which the company’s financial projections are based may prove to be inaccurate which may cause its actual results to materially differ from such projections which may adversely affect the company’s future profitability cash flows and stock price 

the company’s financial projections are dependent on certain estimates and assumptions related to among other things category growth development and launch of innovative new products market share projections product pricing volume and product mix foreign exchange rates and volatility commodity prices distribution cost savings accruals for estimated liabilities including litigation reserves goodwill measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans and the company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in its existing business fund internal growth repurchase its stock make acquisitions pay dividends and meet debt obligations while the company’s financial projections are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made the company’s actual results may differ materially from its financial projections any material variation between the company’s financial projections and its actual results may adversely affect the company’s future profitability cash flows and stock price

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties set forth below as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report or in other filings by the company with the sec could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the company or that are not currently believed by the company to be material may also harm the company’s business operations and financial results 

the company faces intense competition in its markets which could lead to reduced net sales net earnings and cash flow 

the company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the us and in its international markets most of the company’s products compete with other widely advertised brands within each product category the company also faces competition from retailers including club stores grocery stores dollar stores mass merchandisers ecommerce retailers and subscription services which are increasingly offering “private label” brands that are typically sold at lower prices and compete with the company’s products in certain categories increased purchases of “private label” products could reduce net sales of the company’s highermargin products or there could be a shift in product mix to lowermargin offerings which would negatively impact our margins 

the company’s products generally compete on the basis of product performance brand recognition and price advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have significant impacts on consumer purchasing decisions and the company is increasingly using digital media marketing and promotional programs to reach consumers a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it typically requires continued advertising promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position if the company’s advertising marketing and promotional programs including its use of digital media to reach consumers are not effective or adequate the company’s net sales may be negatively impacted 

some of the company’s competitors are larger than the company and have greater financial resources these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the company can in addition the company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the company competitive activity may require the company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions andor reduce prices which could lead to reduced net earnings and adversely affect growth 

volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials energy transportation labor and other necessary supplies or services have negatively impacted and in the future may negatively impact the company’s net earnings and cash flow 

volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials including resin sodium hypochlorite linerboard soybean oil solvent corrugated cardboard and other chemicals and agricultural commodities or increases in the cost of energy transportation labor and other necessary supplies or services have harmed and in the future may harm the company’s profits and operating results we distribute our products and receive raw materials primarily by rail and truck reduced availability of rail or trucking could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and impair our ability to distribute our products or receive our raw materials in a timely manner 

the company believes commodity and other cost increases are possible in the future if such increases occur or exceed the company’s estimates and the company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases its profits and operating results will be harmed in addition if the company increases the prices of its products in response to increases in the cost of commodities and commodity costs decline the company may not be able to sustain its price increases sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or customers may decide not to pay the higher prices which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share while the company seeks to project tradeoffs between price increases and volume its projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 

to reduce the cost volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases the company uses derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps the extent of the company’s derivative position at any given time depends on the company’s assessment of the markets for these commodities the cost volatility in the markets and the cost of the derivative instruments many of the commodities used by the company in its products do not have actively traded derivative instruments if the company does not or is unable to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if it executes a position and costs subsequently decrease the company’s costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than its competitors’ costs and the company’s financial results could be adversely affected for further information regarding the company’s use of derivative instruments see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in exhibit 991 

sales growth objectives may be difficult to achieve the company may not be able to successfully implement price increases and market and category declines and changes to the company’s product and geographic mix may adversely impact the company’s financial results 

a large percentage of the company’s revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition during fiscal year 2017  83 of the company’s net sales were generated in us markets the company’s ability to achieve sales growth depends on its ability to drive growth through innovation expansion into new products and categories channels and countries investment in its established brands and enhanced merchandising and its ability to capture market share from competitors if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product improvements undertake sales marketing and advertising initiatives that grow its product categories andor develop acquire or successfully launch new products or brands it may not achieve its sales growth objectives even when the company is successful in increasing market share within particular product categories a decline in the markets for such product categories has had and can continue to have a negative impact on the company’s financial results in addition changes to the mix of products the company sells as well as the mix of countries in which its products are sold can adversely impact the company’s net sales profitability and cash flow 

dependence on key customers could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the company’s net sales net sales to the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates were 26  27  and 26  of consolidated net sales for each of the fiscal years ended june 30 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively and occurred across all of the company’s reportable segments no other individual customer accounted for 10 or more of the companys consolidated net sales in any of these fiscal years the company’s five largest customers accounted for nearly half of the companys consolidated net sales for each of the fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  and a significant portion of the companys future revenues may continue to be derived from a small number of customers as a result changes in the strategies of the company’s largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry a shift of shelf space to “private label” or competitors’ products or a decision to lower pricing of consumer products including branded products may harm the company’s net sales or margins and reduce the ability of the company to offer new innovative and improved products to consumers in addition the use of the latest technology by our customers regarding pricing may lead to category pricing pressures furthermore any loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in net sales to a key customer even if such loss or reduction relates to a key customer of a business unit of the company could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders and the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its customers accordingly customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the company at any time and for any reason if the company does not effectively respond to the demands of its customers they could decrease their purchases from the company causing the company’s net sales and net earnings to decline furthermore unfavorable market conditions or competitive pressures may cause the company’s customers to reevaluate the number and mix of brands they sell resulting in lower purchases of the company’s products by these customers 

the company continues to see retailer consolidation both in the us and internationally this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailers who have in the past changed and may in the future change their business strategies demand lower pricing or special packaging or impose other burdensome requirements on product suppliers these business demands may relate to inventory practices transportation and storage a shift in focus away from branded products toward “private label” or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship these large consolidated companies could also exert additional competitive pressure on the company’s other customers which could in turn lead to such customers demanding lower pricing or special packaging or imposing other onerous requirements on the company if the company ceases doing business with a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease due to customer inventory reductions or otherwise the company’s business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

the changing retail environment could affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s sales are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery mass retail outlet warehouse club and dollar store channels however alternative retail channels including hard discounters ecommerce retailers and subscription services have become more prevalent and consumer products are increasingly being sold through such alternative retail channels although the company is engaged in ecommerce with respect to many of its products if we are not successful in expanding sales in such alternative retail channels our business financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted in addition the growth of the alternative retail channels that are focused on limiting the number of items they sell and selling predominantly private label products may reduce the companys ability to market and sell its products through such retailers the retail environment is changing with the growth of alternative retail channels and this could significantly 

change the way traditional retailers do business if these alternative retail channels were to take significant market share away from traditional retailers andor the company is not successful in these alternative retail channels our margins and results of operations may be negatively impacted 

cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or a failure of key information technology systems could adversely impact the company’s ability to conduct business 

the company relies extensively on information technology systems many of which are managed by thirdparty service providers in order to conduct its business these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to communicating within the company and with customers consumers vendors investors and other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping products to customers processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with financial reporting regulatory legal and tax requirements and implementing other processes involved in managing the business although the company has made progress with its implementation of enterprisewide upgrades to its hardware software and operating systems legacy systems still remain if the company’s existing andor future technology systems thirdparty service providers and processes do not adequately support the future growth of the company’s business the company’s business may be adversely impacted in addition the company from time to time may need to upgrade its information technology systems if a new system does not function properly it could affect the companys ability to process and deliver customer orders and process and receive payments for its products this could adversely impact the companys results of operations and cash flows 

although the company has a broad array of network and information security measures in place the information technology systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses or other malicious codes security breaches and other disruptions from unauthorized uses or system failures including internet outages while the company has business continuity plans in place if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes including catastrophic events power outages security breaches or other similar events or as a result of legacy systems and if the business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage or conduct business which may adversely impact the company’s business in addition such incidents could result in unauthorized disclosure of material confidential information the company cannot guarantee that its security efforts will prevent attacks and resulting breaches or breakdowns of the companys or its thirdparty service providers databases or systems cyber threats are constantly evolving and this increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them in addition although the company has policies and procedures in place governing the secure storage of personal information collected by the company and its thirdparty service providers as well as protection of company information and assets data breaches or theft of such information assets may occur in the future furthermore the company sells its burt’s bees ®  natural personal care products renewlife ®  digestive health products and other products directly to consumers online and through websites mobile apps and connected devices and the company offers promotions rebates customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information and it or its vendors could experience cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or other incidents that may result in unauthorized disclosure of consumer customer employee vendor or company information 

if the company suffers a loss as a result of a breach or other breakdown in its technology including cyberattack privacy breaches data breaches or other incident involving the company or any of the company’s vendors that result in unauthorized disclosure or significant unavailability of business financial personal or stakeholder information the companys reputation competitiveness andor business may be harmed and the company may be exposed to legal liability which may adversely affect the company’s results of operations andor financial condition in addition if the company’s service providers suppliers or customers experience a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in the company’s supply chain or reduced customer orders or other business operations which would adversely affect the company 

government regulations could impose material costs 

generally the manufacture packaging labeling storage distribution and advertising of the company’s products and the conduct of its business operations must all comply with extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations for example in the us many of the company’s products are regulated by the environmental protection agency the food and drug administration and the consumer product safety commission and the company’s product claims and advertising are regulated by the federal trade commission among other regulatory agencies most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies the company’s international operations are also subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products there is also a risk of potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and related difficulties in maintaining effective internal controls additionally the company could be subject to inquiries or investigations by governmental and other regulatory bodies any determination that the company’s operations or activities are not in compliance with applicable law could expose the company to future 

impairment charges or significant fines penalties or other sanctions that may result in a reduction in net income or otherwise adversely impact the business and reputation of the company 

in particular because of the company’s extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of the foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws the foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees jointventure partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

it is expected that federal state and foreign governments will continue to introduce new and expanded legislation affecting the company’s operations which may require the company to increase its resources capabilities and expertise in such areas for example the company is subject to regulations regarding the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment including as a result of evolving climate change standards and new and increased regulation in other areas such as with respect to “conflict minerals” such regulation could negatively impact the company’s ability to obtain raw materials or could increase its acquisition and compliance costs in addition the company is subject to laws of various countries where it operates or does business related to solicitation collection processing or use of consumer customer vendor or employee information or related data furthermore pending legislative initiatives and adopted legislation in the areas of healthcare reform and other areas such as the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the foreign account tax compliance act and legislation in the area of taxation of domestic and foreign profits executive compensation and corporate governance could also increase the company’s costs these risks may be increased by the company’s fiscal year 2016 acquisition of renewlife which manufactures products subject to additional regulations 

additionally recent reform proposals have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries major developments in tax policy or trade relations could have a material effect on our balance sheet and results of operations 

if the company is found to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas including the evolving regulations related to privacy and data security and protection it could be subject to civil remedies including fines import detentions injunctions product withdrawals or recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations particularly with respect to its charcoal business could delay or prevent the company from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results as the company expands its natural personal care and healthcare businesses such as through burt’s bees ®  healthlink ®  aplicare ®  and caltech industries an increasing number of its products have and will become subject to regulations and laws relating to drugs and medical devices in addition the companys digestive health space business resulting from its acquisition of renewlife ®  has products that are subject to regulations relating to dietary supplements in order to comply with these laws and regulations the company may be required to make changes to product formulation labeling or marketing claims perform additional testing to substantiate its product claims make costly changes in its manufacturing processes or supply chain or stop selling certain products until corrective actions have been taken 

acquisitions new venture investments and divestitures may not be successful which could impact the company’s business operations and financial results 

in connection with the company’s strategy the company expects to continue to seek acquisition opportunities such as the fiscal year 2016 acquisition of renewlife which competes in the digestive health category however the company may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic acquisitions at attractive prices in addition all acquisitions and investments entail numerous risks including risks relating to the company’s ability to 



acquired companies or operations or joint ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability and cash flow expectations future acquisitions or ventures could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt the assumption of contingent liabilities including litigation an increase in expenses related to certain assets and increased operating expenses all of which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would subject the company to local regulations and could potentially lead to risks related to among other things increased exposure to foreign exchange rate changes tax or labor laws government price control repatriation of profits and liabilities relating to the foreign corrupt practices act in addition to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the company’s acquisitions diminish in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill intangible assets or other assets associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect its operating results andor net earnings per share 

the company may also divest certain assets businesses or brands that do not meet the company’s strategic objectives or growth targets with respect to any divestiture the company may encounter difficulty finding potential acquirers or other divestiture options on favorable terms any divestiture could affect the profitability of the company as a result of the gains or losses on such sale of a business or brand the loss of the operating income or sales resulting from such sale or the costs or liabilities that are not assumed by the acquirer that may negatively impact profitability and cash flow subsequent to any divestiture the company may also be required to recognize impairment charges as a result of a divestiture 

in addition any potential future acquisitions new ventures or divestitures may divert the attention of management and resources from matters that are core or critical to the company’s business 

uncertain worldwide regional and local economic and financial market conditions may negatively impact the company and consumers of its products which would negatively affect the company’s financial performance and liquidity 

although the company continues to devote significant resources to support its brands uncertain economic conditions have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect consumer demand for the company’s products consumers may also be sensitive to economic uncertainty or unfavorable economic conditions and reduce discretionary spending which may lead to reduced net sales or cause a shift in the company’s product mix from highermargin to lowermargin products consumers may increase purchases of lowerpriced or “private label” products and the company’s competitors may increase levels of advertising and promotional activity for lowerpriced products as they seek to maintain sales volumes during uncertain economic times which may negatively impact the company’s net sales 

global markets continued to face threats and uncertainty during fiscal year 2017  uncertain economic and financial market conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of the company’s customers suppliers and other business partners if customers’ financial conditions are adversely affected customers may reduce their purchases of the company’s products or the company may not be able to collect accounts receivable each of which could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business operations or financial results 

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations and international trade 

in fiscal year 2017  17 of the company’s net sales were generated in international markets the company faces and will continue to face substantial risks associated with its foreign operations including the following 



 

in addition changes as result of the united kingdoms decision to exit the european union could subject the company to heightened risks in that region including disruptions to trade and free movement of goods services and people to and from the united kingdom increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the british pound and additional legal and economic uncertainty moreover as a result of the 2016 us presidential and congressional elections there may be shifts in us foreign trade economic and other policies that may negatively impact our foreign operations and our ability to market our products in certain international markets all of the foregoing risks could have a significant adverse impact on the company’s ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition the company’s small sales volume in some countries relative to some multinational and local competitors could exacerbate such risks 

in addition the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks with respect to its net sales net earnings and cash flow driven by movements of the us dollar relative to other currencies a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease net earnings and cash flow although the company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks these hedges only offset a small portion of the company’s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and therefore the company’s reported net earnings may be negatively affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 

inflation is another risk associated with the company’s international operations for example argentina could in the future be designated as a highly inflationary economy gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of nonus dollar monetary assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in net earnings other countries in which the company operates may also become highly inflationary or such countries’ currencies may be devalued or both which may negatively impact the company’s business operations and financial results 

for further information regarding argentina see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in exhibit 991 

the company may not successfully achieve its innovation goals or develop and introduce new products and line extensions or expand into adjacent categories and countries which could adversely impact its financial results 

the company’s future performance and growth depends on innovation and its ability to successfully develop or license capabilities to introduce new products brands line extensions and product improvements or enter into or expand into adjacent product categories sales channels or countries the companys ability to quickly innovate in order to adapt its products to meet changing consumer demands is essential especially in light of ecommerce significantly reducing the barriers for even small competitors to quickly introduce new brands and products directly to consumers this risk is further heightened by the continued evolution of consumer needs habits and preferences as a result of shifts in us demographics reflecting various factors including cultural and socioeconomic changes the company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve its innovation goals the development and introduction of new products require substantial and effective research and development and demand creation expenditures which the company may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance in addition effective and integrated systems are required for the company to gather and use consumer data and information to successfully market its products new product development and marketing efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays which could result in the company not being first to market and the failure of new products brands and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance if product introductions 

or new or expanded adjacencies are not successful costs associated with these efforts may not be fully recouped and the company’s net earnings could be adversely affected in addition if sales generated by new products cause a decline in sales of the company’s existing products the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

profitability and cash flow could suffer if the company is unable to generate anticipated cost savings successfully implement its strategies or efficiently manage supply chain and manufacturing processes 

the company continues to implement plans to improve its competitive position by setting aggressive annual cost savings targets and it expects ongoing cost savings from its continuous improvement activities the company anticipates these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing inefficiencies and realizing productivity gains distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions if the company cannot successfully implement its cost savings plans or the cost of making these changes increases the company may not realize all anticipated benefits which could adversely affect its financial results or its longterm strategies such as the 2020 strategy which includes financial goals such as annual net sales growth of 35 annual ebit margin growth between 2550 basis points and annual free cash flow as a percentage of net sales of about 1012 the company also continues to seek to penetrate new markets and introduce new products and product improvements these goals and strategies may not be implemented or may fail to achieve desired results and the company may fail to achieve one or more of the financial goals for one or more of the relevant fiscal years in addition the company expects to continue to restructure its operations as necessary to improve operational efficiency including occasionally opening or closing offices facilities or plants gaining additional efficiencies may become increasingly difficult over time there may be onetime costs relating to facility closures or other restructurings and anticipated cost savings and the company’s strategies may not be implemented or may fail to achieve desired results if the company is unable to generate anticipated costs savings successfully implement its strategies or efficiently manage its supply chain and manufacturing processes the company’s financial results could suffer these plans and strategies could also have a negative impact on the company’s relationships with employees or customers which could also adversely affect the company’s financial results 

harm to the company’s reputation or the reputation of one or more of its leading brands could have an adverse effect on the business 

maintaining a strong reputation with consumers customers and trade partners is critical to the success of the company’s business the company devotes significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve the company’s reputation and the reputation of its brands these programs include ethics and compliance setting sustainability goals and product safety and quality initiatives despite these efforts negative publicity about the company including product safety quality efficacy and sustainability or similar concerns whether real or perceived could occur and the company may not meet its sustainability goals as a result the company’s products could face withdrawal recall or other quality issues the company also licenses certain of its brands to third parties which creates additional exposure for those brands to product safety quality sustainability and other concerns in addition widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination negative publicity posts or comments on social media or network sites about the company or its brands whether accurate or inaccurate or disclosure of nonpublic sensitive information about the company could be widely disseminated through the use of social media such events if they were to occur could harm the company’s image and adversely affect its business as well as require resources to rebuild the company’s reputation 

an increase in the value of the company’s glad ®   business would result in an increase in the company’s purchase obligation for the procter  gamble company’s pg’s 20 interest in that business which may adversely affect the company’s net earnings and cash flow additionally it is uncertain whether the company’s net earnings and cash flow would be adversely affected more by an extension or a termination of the agreement related to the glad ®   business 

in january 2003 the company entered into a venture agreement with pg related to the company’s glad ®  bags wraps and containers business in connection with this agreement pg provides research and development support to the glad ®  business the agreement with pg will expire in january 2023 unless the parties agree on or prior to january 2018 to extend the term of the agreement for another 10 years or agree to take some other relevant action 

unless extended the agreement will require the company to purchase pg’s 20 interest in january 2023 for cash at fair value as established by predetermined valuation procedures as of june 30 2017  the estimated fair value of pg’s interest was 458 million  of which  317 million  has been recognized by the company and is reflected in other liabilities in the company’s june 30 2017  consolidated balance sheet the difference between the estimated fair value and the amount recognized and any future changes in the fair value of pg’s interest is charged to cost of products sold in accordance with the effective interest method over the remaining life of the agreement the estimated fair value of pgs interest increased significantly over the past several years and may continue to change up until any such purchase by the company of pg’s 

interest any additional significant increases in the fair value of such interest may adversely affect the company’s net earnings and future cash flow 

if the company and pg decide not to extend the term of the agreement this decision may harm the terms on which the company has access to innovation from pg alternatively if the company and pg decide to extend the term of the agreement there can be no assurance that any future innovation will result in either case net earnings and cash flow may be negatively impacted for additional information see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in exhibit 991 

reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in disruptions to the company’s business 

the company relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain commodities and raw material inputs including solesource and singlesource suppliers for certain of its raw materials packaging product components finished products and other necessary supplies new suppliers have to be qualified under company standards and may also have to be qualified under governmental and industry standards and any relevant standards of the companys customers which can require additional investment and time the company could experience disruptions in production and its financial results and relationships with customers could be adversely affected if the company is unable to qualify any needed new suppliers or maintain supplier arrangements and relationships if it is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity quality and price levels needed for its business or if any of the company’s key suppliers becomes insolvent or experiences financial distress or if any environmental economic or other outside factors impact its operations 

product liability commercial claims or other legal proceedings could adversely affect the company’s net sales and operating results including cash flow 

the company has in the past paid and may be required in the future to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products such claims may be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants or provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use have defective packaging fail to perform as advertised or damage property or persons product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation sales and operating results and the reputation of the companys brands in addition if any of the company’s products is found to be defective the company may recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage insurance recovery for product liability claims may be subject to a retention exceed the amount of insurance coverage or be excluded under the terms of the policies 

in addition the company is and may in the future become the subject of or party to various pending or threatened legal actions government investigations and proceedings from time to time including advertising disputes with competitors consumer class actions including those related to advertising claims labor claims breach of contract claims antitrust litigation securities litigation premises liability claims and litigation in foreign jurisdictions in general claims made by or against the company in litigation investigations disputes or other proceedings have been and can in the future be expensive and timeconsuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements injunctions or damages that could significantly affect its business or financial results or condition it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation investigations disputes or proceedings with which the company currently is or may in the future become involved the impact of these matters on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition could be material see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the notes to consolidated financial statements in exhibit 991 for additional information related to these matters 

loss of or inability to attract key personnel could adversely impact the company’s business 

the company’s success depends in part on its ability to retain its key personnel including its executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of one or more of the company’s key employees could disrupt its business the company’s success also depends in part on its continuing ability to identify hire train and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense especially in the san francisco bay area where the company’s headquarters and largest research facility are located in addition the companys employees may be targeted and recruited by other companies as the company expands into new categories or markets including more regulated businesses it will also require personnel with relevant training and experience in such categories or markets the company may not be able to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future and its failure to do so could adversely affect the company 

environmental matters create potential liabilities that could adversely affect the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to air emissions water discharges handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances and climate change the company has incurred 

and will continue to incur significant expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations and such expenditures reduce the cash flow available to the company for other purposes 

the company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its current and former facilities in addition some of its present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many years and over that time some of those facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that those sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom the company has sent waste may be identified and become the subject of remediation the company could also become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 

the company had a recorded liability of 28 million and 14 million as of june 30 2017  and 2016  respectively for its share of aggregate future remediation costs related to certain environmental matters including response actions at various locations one matter which accounted for 14 million and less than 1 million of the recorded liability as of june 30 2017 and 2016 respectively relates to environmental costs associated with one of the company’s former operations at a site located in alameda county california another matter in dickinson county michigan for which the company is jointly and severally liable accounted for 12 million and 11 million of the recorded liability as of june 30 2017  and 2016  respectively the company’s estimated losses related to these matters are sensitive to a variety of uncertain factors including the efficacy of any remediation efforts changes in any remediation requirements and the future availability of alternative cleanup technologies and the company’s exposure may exceed the amount recorded for these matters see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the notes to consolidated financial statements in exhibit 991 for additional information related to these liabilities 

the company also handles andor transports hazardous substances including but not limited to chlorine at some of its international production facilities a release of such chemicals whether in transit or at the company’s facilities due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability and business disruptions 

the facilities of the company and its suppliers are subject to disruption by events beyond the company’s control 

operations at facilities of the company its suppliers service providers and retail customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages demonstrations disease outbreaks or pandemics acts of war terrorism fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters the company’s corporate headquarters and primary research and development facility are located near major earthquake fault lines in california if a major disruption were to occur it could result in injury to people damages to the natural environment temporary loss of access to critical data delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations any such disruption could have a material adverse impact on the company and its financial results 

failure to maximize successfully assert or successfully defend the company’s intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness 

the company relies on intellectual property rights based on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its brands products packaging for its products inventions and confidential information the company cannot be certain that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions and product improvements the company cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be invalidated circumvented or challenged and the company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert its intellectual property rights or to defend those rights from assertions of invalidity in addition even if such rights are obtained in the us the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if other parties infringe the company’s intellectual property rights they may dilute or diminish the value of the company’s brands and products in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the company’s brands and harm its net sales the failure to perfect and protect its intellectual property rights could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

if the company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others its competitiveness could be negatively impacted 

if the company is found to have violated the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of thirdparty marks ideas or technologies such a finding could result in the need to cease use of such trademark trade secret copyrighted work or patented invention in the company’s business and the obligation to pay for past infringement if holders are willing to permit the company to continue to use such intellectual 

property rights they could require a payment of a substantial amount for continued use of those rights either ceasing use or paying such amounts could cause the company to become less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

even if the company is not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights claims of infringement could adversely affect the company’s business for example if the company seeks proposals from multiple vendors for a new product or innovation and chooses to partner with a particular vendor another vendor may claim the company infringed its intellectual property rights by using information gathered from the vendor proposals the company could incur material legal costs and related expenses to defend against such claims and the company could incur significant costs associated with discontinuing to use provide or manufacture certain products services or trademarks even if it is ultimately found not to have infringed such rights 

the company’s indebtedness could adversely affect its business operations and financial results and prevent the company from fulfilling its obligations and the company may incur substantially more debt in the future which could exacerbate these risks 

as of june 30 2017  the company had over 2 billion of debt the company’s indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

 additionally failure by the company to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in its debt documents could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could have a significant adverse effect on the company further certain terms of the agreements governing the company’s overthecounter derivative instruments contain provisions that require the company’s credit ratings as assigned by standard  poor’s and moody’s to the company to remain at a level equal to or better than the minimum of an investment grade credit rating as of june 30 2017  the company had been assigned investmentgrade ratings with both standard  poor’s and moody’s however if the company’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade the counterparties to the derivative instruments in net liability positions could request full collateralization 

the company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions repurchase shares or fund other activities for general business purposes subject to compliance with the company’s existing debt covenants as of june 30 2017  the company could add approximately 4 billion in incremental debt and remain in compliance with its debt covenants although the actual amount that the company may be able to borrow in the future may not equal this amount if new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that the company now faces could intensify in addition the cost of incurring additional debt could increase due to rising interest rates possible downgrades in the company’s credit rating economic conditions or otherwise in this regard failure to maintain the companys credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate in future financings liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

the company may not continue to pay dividends or repurchase its stock 

although the company has historically declared and paid quarterly cash dividends on its common stock and has been authorized to repurchase its shares subject to certain limitations under its share repurchase programs any determinations by the board of directors to continue to declare and pay cash dividends on the company’s common stock or to repurchase the company’s common stock will be based primarily upon the company’s financial condition results of operations and business requirements the price of its common stock in the case of the repurchase program and the board of directors’ continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration and payment of dividends are in the best interests of the company’s stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs the company’s ability to continue to declare and pay cash dividends will depend upon among other things its cash balances and future cash requirements results of operations financial condition and net earnings all of which are subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond the company’s control in the event 

the company does not declare and pay a quarterly dividend or discontinues its share repurchases the company’s stock price could be adversely affected 

the company’s continued growth and expansion and reliance on thirdparty service providers could adversely affect its internal control over financial reporting which could harm its business and financial results 

clorox management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the company’s financial statements would be prevented or detected the company’s continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets such as its acquisition of renewlife may place significant additional pressure on the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting moreover the company engages the services of third parties to assist with business operations and financial reporting processes which injects additional monitoring obligations and risk into the system of internal control any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the company’s ability to report its financial results accurately and on a timely basis or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose it to regulatory enforcement action and shareholder claims 

the company’s judgments regarding the accounting for tax positions and the resolution of tax disputes may impact the company’s net earnings and cash flow 

significant judgment is required to determine the company’s effective tax rate and evaluate its tax positions the company provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement criteria prescribed by applicable accounting standards fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties may impact the company’s effective tax rate and the company’s financial results when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved unfavorable resolution of any tax matter in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the effective tax rate which would have an adverse effect on the company’s operating results any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution for additional information see the information set forth in the notes to consolidated financial statements in exhibit 991 

the estimates and assumptions on which the company’s financial projections are based may prove to be inaccurate which may cause its actual results to materially differ from such projections which may adversely affect the company’s future profitability cash flows and stock price

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties set forth below as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report or in other filings by the company with the sec could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the company or that are not currently believed by the company to be material may also harm the company’s business operations and financial results 

the company faces intense competition in its markets which could lead to reduced net sales net earnings and cash flow 

the company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the united states and in its international markets most of the company’s products compete with other widely advertised brands within each product category the company also faces competition from retailers including club stores grocery dollar stores mass merchandisers and internetbased retailers which are increasingly offering “private label” brands that are typically sold at lower prices and compete with the company’s products in certain categories during times of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more “private label” or other economy brands increased purchases of “private label” products could reduce net sales of the company’s highermargin products or there could be a shift in product mix to lowermargin offerings 

the company’s products generally compete on the basis of product performance brand recognition and price advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have significant impacts on consumer purchasing decisions and the company is increasingly using digital media marketing and promotional programs to reach consumers a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it typically requires continued advertising promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position if the company’s advertising marketing and promotional programs including its use of digital media to reach consumers are not effective or adequate the company’s net sales may be negatively impacted 

some of the company’s competitors are larger than the company and have greater financial resources these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the company can in addition the company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the company competitive activity may require the company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions andor reduce prices which could lead to reduced net earnings and adversely affect growth 

uncertain worldwide regional and local economic conditions and financial market volatility may negatively impact the company and consumers of its products which would negatively affect the company’s financial performance and liquidity 

although the company continues to devote significant resources to support its brands uncertain economic conditions may continue to negatively affect consumer demand for the company’s products consumers may also be sensitive to economic uncertainty or unfavorable economic conditions and reduce discretionary spending which may lead to reduced net sales or cause a shift in the company’s product mix from highermargin to lowermargin products consumers may increase purchases of lowerpriced or “private label” products and the company’s competitors may increase levels of advertising and promotional activity for lowerpriced products as they seek to maintain sales volumes during uncertain economic times which may negatively impact the company’s net sales 

global markets continued to experience significant disruptions during fiscal year 2016 and continuing volatility could continue to harm the company’s business in addition financial market volatility could adversely affect the company’s liquidity and capital resources uncertain economic conditions and financial market volatility may also adversely affect the financial condition of the company’s customers suppliers and other business partners if customers’ financial conditions are severely affected customers may reduce their purchases of the company’s products or the company may not be able to collect accounts receivable each of which could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business operations or financial results 

sales growth objectives may be difficult to achieve and price increases market and category declines and changes to the company’s product and geographic mix may adversely impact the company’s financial results 

a large percentage of the company’s revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition during fiscal year 2016 approximately 83 of the company’s net sales were generated in us markets the company’s ability to achieve sales growth depends on its ability to drive growth through innovation expansion into new product categories channels and countries investment in its established brands and enhanced merchandising and its ability to capture market share from competitors if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product improvements undertake sales marketing and advertising initiatives that grow its product categories andor develop acquire or successfully launch new products or brands it may not achieve its sales growth objectives even when the company is successful in increasing market share within particular product categories a decline in the markets for such product categories has had and can continue to have a negative impact on the company’s financial results 

in addition changes to the mix of products the company sells as well as the mix of countries in which its products are sold can adversely impact the company’s net sales profitability and cash flow the company’s financial outlook assumes a certain volume and product mix and if actual results vary from this projected volume and product mix the company’s business operations and financial results could be negatively affected 

volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials energy transportation labor and other necessary supplies or services have harmed and in the future may harm the company’s net earnings and cash flow 

volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials including resin sodium hypochlorite linerboard soybean oil solvent corrugated cardboard and other chemicals and agricultural commodities or increases in the cost of energy transportation labor and other necessary supplies or services have harmed and in the future may harm the company’s profits and operating results we distribute our products and receive raw materials primarily by rail and truck reduced availability of rail or trucking could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and impair our ability to distribute our products or receive our raw materials in a timely manner 

the company believes commodity and other cost increases are possible in the future if such increases occur or exceed the company’s estimates and the company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases its profits and operating results will be harmed in addition if the company increases the prices of its products in response to increases in the cost of commodities and commodity costs decline the company may not be able to sustain its price increases sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or customers may decide not to pay the higher prices which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share while the company seeks to project tradeoffs between price increases and volume its projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 

to reduce the cost volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases the company uses derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps the extent of the company’s derivative position at any given time depends on the company’s assessment of the markets for these commodities the cost volatility in the markets and the cost of the derivative instruments many of the commodities used by the company in its products do not have actively traded derivative instruments if the company does not or is unable to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if it institutes a position and costs subsequently decrease the company’s costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than its competitors’ costs and the company’s financial results could be adversely affected for further information regarding the company’s use of derivative instruments see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in exhibit 991 

dependence on key customers could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the company’s net sales net sales to the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates were 27 26 and 27 of consolidated net sales for each of the fiscal years ended june 30 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively and occurred in each of the company’s reportable segments no other individual customer accounted for more than 10 of consolidated net sales in any of these fiscal years during fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 the company’s five largest customers accounted for 46 45 and 45 of its consolidated net sales for each of the three fiscal years respectively the company expects that a significant portion of its revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers as a result changes in the strategies of the company’s largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to “private label” or competitors’ products may harm the company’s net sales and reduce the ability of the company to offer new innovative and improved products to consumers in addition any loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in net sales to a key customer even if such loss or reduction relates to a key customer of a business unit of the company could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders and the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its customers accordingly customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the company at any time and for any reason if the company does not effectively respond to the demands of its customers they could decrease their purchases from the company causing the company’s net sales and net earnings to decline furthermore unfavorable market conditions or competitive pressures may cause the company’s customers to reevaluate the number and mix of brands they sell resulting in lower purchases of the company’s products by these customers 

the company continues to see retailer consolidation both in the united states and internationally this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailers who have in the past changed and may in the future change their business strategies demand lower pricing or special packaging or impose other burdensome requirements on product suppliers these business demands may relate to inventory practices logistics a shift in focus away from branded products toward “private label” or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship these large consolidated companies could also exert additional competitive pressure on the company’s other customers which could in turn lead to such customers demanding lower pricing or special packaging or imposing other onerous requirements on the company if the company ceases doing business with a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease due to customer inventory reductions or otherwise the company’s business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or a failure of key information technology systems could adversely impact the company’s ability to conduct business 

the company relies extensively on information technology systems many of which are managed by thirdparty service providers in order to conduct its business these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to communicating within the company and with customers consumers and other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping products to customers processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal and tax requirements and implementing other processes involved in managing the business although the company has made progress with its implementation of enterprisewide upgrades to its hardware software and operating systems legacy systems still remain if the company’s existing andor future technology systems thirdparty service providers and processes do not adequately support the future growth of the company’s business the company’s business may be adversely impacted 

although the company has network security measures in place the systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses or other malicious codes security breaches and other disruptions from unauthorized users or system failures including internet outages while the company has business continuity plans in place if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes including catastrophic events power outages security breaches or other similar events and if the business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage or conduct business which may adversely impact the company’s business furthermore the company sells its burt’s bees ® natural personal care products renew life ® digestive health products and other products directly to consumers online provides websites mobile apps and connected devices and offers promotions rebates customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information and it or its vendors could experience cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or other incidents that result in unauthorized disclosure of consumer customer employee or company information in august 2015 the federal government brought an indictment against brokers and hackers for stealing advanced nonpublic press releases of various public companies from news wires and trading on securities using the information from such press releases if the company suffers a loss as a result of a breach or other breakdown in its technology including such cyberattack privacy breaches data breaches or other incident involving one of the company’s vendors that result in unauthorized disclosure or significant unavailability of business financial personal or stakeholder information the company may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm and may be exposed to legal liability which may adversely affect the company’s results of operations andor financial condition in addition if the company’s service providers suppliers or customers experience such a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in the company’s supply chain or reduced customer orders which would adversely affect the company’s business operations 

government regulations could impose material costs 

generally the manufacture packaging labeling storage distribution and advertising of the company’s products and the conduct of its business operations must all comply with extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations for example in the united states many of the company’s products are regulated by the environmental protection agency the food and drug administration and the consumer product safety commission and the company’s product claims and advertising are regulated by the federal trade commission among other regulatory agencies most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies the company’s international operations are also subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products there is also a risk of potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and related difficulties in maintaining effective internal controls additionally the company could be subject to inquiries or investigations by governmental and other regulatory bodies any determination that the company’s operations or activities are not in compliance with applicable law could expose the company to significant fines penalties or other sanctions that may harm the business and reputation of the company 

in particular because of the company’s extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of the foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws the foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees jointventure partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

it is expected that federal state and foreign governments will continue to introduce new and expanded legislation affecting the company’s operations which may require the company to increase its resources capabilities and expertise in such areas for example the company is subject to regulations regarding the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment including as a result of evolving climate change standards and new and increased regulation in other areas such as with respect to “conflict minerals” such regulation could negatively impact the company’s ability to obtain raw materials or could increase its acquisition and compliance costs in addition pending legislative initiatives and adopted legislation in the areas of healthcare reform and other areas such as the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the foreign account tax compliance act and legislation in the area of taxation of domestic and foreign profits executive compensation and corporate governance could also increase the company’s costs these risks may be increased by the company’s recent acquisition of renew life which manufactures products subject to additional regulations 

if the company is found to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas it could be subject to civil remedies including fines import detentions injunctions product withdrawals or recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations particularly with respect to its charcoal business could delay or prevent the company from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results as the company expands its natural personal care and healthcare businesses such as through burt’s bees ®  healthlink ®  aplicare ® and caltech industries an increasing number of its products have and will become subject to regulations and laws relating to drugs and medical devices in addition as the company enters the digestive health space through its acquisition of renew life ®  its products are subject to regulations relating to dietary supplements in order to comply with these laws and regulations the company may be required to make changes to product formulation labeling or marketing claims perform additional testing to substantiate its product claims make costly changes in its manufacturing processes or supply chain or stop selling certain products until corrective actions have been taken 

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations 

in fiscal year 2016 approximately 17 of the company’s net sales were generated in international markets including approximately 3 of the company’s net sales in argentina the company faces and will continue to face substantial risks associated with its foreign operations including the following 

 the risks described above could have a significant adverse impact on the company’s ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition the company’s small sales volume in some countries relative to some multinational and local competitors could exacerbate such risks 

in addition the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks with respect to its net sales net earnings and cash flow driven by movements of the us dollar relative to other currencies a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease net earnings and cash flow although the company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks these hedges only offset a small portion of the company’s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and therefore the company’s reported net earnings may be negatively affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 

inflation is another risk associated with the company’s international operations for example argentina could in the future be designated as a highly inflationary economy gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of nonus dollar monetary assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in net earnings other countries in which the company operates may also become highly inflationary or such countries’ currencies may be devalued or both which may negatively impact the company’s business operations and financial results 

for further information regarding argentina see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in exhibit 991 

acquisitions new venture investments and divestitures may not be successful which could impact the company’s business operations and financial results 

in connection with the company’s strategy the company expects to continue to seek acquisition opportunities such as the recent acquisition of renew life which competes in the digestive health category however the company may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic acquisitions at attractive prices in addition all acquisitions and investments entail numerous risks including risks relating to the company’s ability to 

 acquired companies or operations or joint ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability and cash flow expectations future acquisitions or ventures could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt the assumption of contingent liabilities including litigation an increase in expenses related to certain assets and increased operating expenses all of which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would subject the company to local regulations and could potentially lead to risks related to among other things increased exposure to foreign exchange rate changes government price control repatriation of profits and liabilities relating to the foreign corrupt practices act in addition to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the company’s acquisitions diminish in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill intangible assets or other assets associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect its operating results andor net earnings per share 

the company may also divest certain assets businesses or brands that do not meet the company’s strategic objectives or growth targets with respect to any divestiture the company may encounter difficulty finding potential acquirers or other divestiture options on favorable terms any divestiture could affect the profitability of the company as a result of the gains or losses on such sale of a business or brand the loss of the operating income resulting from such sale or the costs or liabilities that are not assumed by the acquirer ie stranded costs that may negatively impact profitability and cash flow subsequent to any divestiture the company may also be required to recognize impairment charges as a result of a divesture 

in addition any potential future acquisitions new ventures or divestitures may divert the attention of management and resources from matters that are core or critical to the company’s business 

the company may not successfully develop and introduce new products and line extensions or successfully expand into adjacent categories and countries which could adversely impact its financial results 

the company’s future performance and growth depends on innovation and its ability to successfully develop or license capabilities to introduce new products brands line extensions and product improvements or enter into or expand into adjacent product categories sales channels or countries the company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve its innovation goals the development and introduction of new products require substantial and effective research and development and marketing expenditures which the company may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance in addition effective and integrated systems are required for the company to gather and use consumer data and information to successfully market its products new product development and marketing efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays which could result in the company not being first to market and the failure of new products brands and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance if product introductions or new or expanded adjacencies are not successful costs associated with these efforts may not be fully recouped and the company’s net earnings could be adversely affected in addition if sales generated by new products cause a decline in sales of the company’s existing products the company’s financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected  

reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in disruptions to the company’s business 

the company relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain commodities and raw material inputs including solesource and singlesource suppliers for certain of its raw materials packaging product components finished products and other necessary supplies new suppliers have to be qualified under company standards and may also have to be qualified under governmental and industry standards which can require additional investment and time the company could experience disruptions in production and its financial results and relationships with customers could be adversely affected if the company is unable to qualify any needed new suppliers or maintain supplier arrangements and relationships if it is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity quality and price levels needed for its business or if any of the company’s key suppliers becomes insolvent experiences financial distress or environmental economic or other outside factors impact its operations 

product liability commercial claims or other legal proceedings could adversely affect the company’s net sales and operating results including cash flow 

the company has in the past paid and may be required in the future to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products such claims may be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants or provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use have defective packaging fail to perform as advertised or damage property or persons product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation sales and operating results in addition if any of the company’s products is found to be defective the company may recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses in july 2016 the company voluntarily recalled three of the liquidplumr ® products which recall affects products manufactured prior to march 22 2016 although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims may be subject to a retention exceed the amount of insurance coverage or be excluded under the terms of the policies 

in addition the company is and may in the future become the subject of or party to various pending or threatened legal actions government investigations and proceedings from time to time including advertising disputes with competitors consumer class actions including those related to advertising claims labor claims breach of contract claims antitrust litigation securities litigation premises liability claims and litigation in foreign jurisdictions in general claims made by or against the company in litigation investigations disputes or other proceedings have been and can in the future be expensive and timeconsuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements injunctions or damages that could significantly affect its business or financial results or condition it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation investigations disputes or proceedings with which the company currently is or may in the future become involved the impact of these matters on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition could be material see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the notes to consolidated financial statements in exhibit 991 for additional information related to these matters 

profitability and cash flow could suffer if the company is unable to successfully implement its strategies generate anticipated cost savings and efficiencies or efficiently manage supply chain and manufacturing processes 

the company continues to implement plans to improve its competitive position by setting aggressive annual cost savings targets and it expects ongoing cost savings from its continuous improvement activities the company anticipates these continuing cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing inefficiencies and realizing productivity gains distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions if the company cannot successfully implement its cost savings plans or the cost of making these changes increases the company may not realize all anticipated benefits which could adversely affect its financial results or its longterm strategies such as the 2020 strategy which includes financial goals such as annual net sales growth of 35 annual ebit margin growth between 2550 basis points and annual free cash flow as a percentage of net sales of about 1012 the company also continues to seek to penetrate new markets and introduce new products and product improvements these goals and strategies may not be implemented or may fail to achieve desired results and the company may fail to achieve one or more of the financial goals for one or more of the relevant fiscal years in addition the company expects to continue to restructure its operations as necessary to improve operational efficiency including occasionally closing facilities or plants gaining additional efficiencies may become increasingly difficult over time there may be onetime costs relating to facility closures or other restructurings and anticipated cost savings and the company’s strategies may not be implemented or may fail to achieve desired results if the company is unable to implement its strategies or if its strategies do not achieve the intended effects if it does not realize cost savings and other efficiencies or if it is unable to efficiently manage its supply chain and manufacturing processes the company’s financial results could suffer these plans and strategies could also have a negative impact on the company’s relationships with employees or customers which could also adversely affect the company’s financial results 

loss of or inability to attract key personnel could adversely impact the company’s business 

the company’s success depends in part on its ability to retain its key personnel including its executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of one or more of the company’s key employees could disrupt its business the company’s success also depends in part on its continuing ability to identify hire train and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense especially in the san francisco bay area where the company’s headquarters and largest research facility are located as the company expands into new categories or markets including more regulated businesses it will also require personnel with relevant training and experience in such categories or markets the company may not be able to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future and its failure to do so could adversely affect its business 

harm to the company’s reputation or the reputation of one or more of its leading brands could have an adverse effect on the business 

maintaining a strong reputation with consumers customers and trade partners is critical to the success of the company’s business the company devotes significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve the company’s reputation and the reputation of its brands these programs include ethics and compliance sustainability and product safety and quality initiatives despite these efforts negative publicity about the company including product safety quality efficacy or similar concerns whether real or perceived could occur and the company’s products could face withdrawal recall or other quality issues the company also licenses certain of its brands to third parties which creates additional exposure for those brands to product safety quality and other concerns in addition widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination negative publicity posts or comments on social media or network sites about the company or its brands whether accurate or inaccurate or disclosure of nonpublic sensitive information about the company could be widely disseminated through the use of social media such events if they were to occur could harm the company’s image and adversely affect its business as well as require resources to rebuild the company’s reputation 

environmental matters create potential liabilities that could adversely affect the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to air emissions water discharges handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances and climate change the company has incurred and will continue to incur significant expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations and such expenditures reduce the cash flow available to the company for other purposes 

the company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its current and former facilities in addition some of its present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many years and over that time some of those facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that those sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom the company has sent waste may be identified and become the subject of remediation the company could also become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 

the company had a recorded liability of 14 million and 12 million as of june 30 2016 and 2015 respectively for its share of aggregate future remediation costs related to certain environmental matters including response actions at various locations one matter in dickinson county michigan for which the company is jointly and severally liable accounts for a substantial majority of the recorded liability as of both june 30 2016 and 2015 see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the notes to consolidated financial statements in exhibit 991 for additional information related to these liabilities 

the company also handles andor transports hazardous substances including but not limited to chlorine at some of its international plant sites a release of such chemicals whether in transit or at the company’s facilities due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability and business disruptions 

the facilities of the company and its suppliers are subject to disruption by events beyond the company’s control 

operations at facilities of the company its suppliers service providers and retail customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages demonstrations disease outbreaks or pandemics acts of war terrorism fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters the company’s corporate headquarters and primary research and development facility are located near major earthquake fault lines in california if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment temporary loss of access to critical data delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations any such disruption could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business 

failure to maximize successfully assert or successfully defend the company’s intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness 

the company relies on intellectual property rights based on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its brands products and packaging for its products the company cannot be certain that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions the company cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be invalidated circumvented or challenged and the company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert its intellectual property rights or to defend those rights from assertions of invalidity in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if other parties infringe the company’s intellectual property rights they may dilute or diminish the value of the company’s brands and products in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the company’s brands and harm its net sales the failure to perfect and protect its intellectual property rights could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

if the company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others its competitiveness could be negatively impacted 

if the company is found to have violated the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of thirdparty marks ideas or technologies such a finding could result in the need to cease use of such trademark trade secret copyrighted work or patented invention in the company’s business and the obligation to pay for past infringement if holders are willing to permit the company to continue to use such intellectual property rights they could require a payment of a substantial amount for continued use of those rights either ceasing use or paying such amounts could cause the company to become less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

even if the company is not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights claims of infringement could adversely affect the company’s business for example if the company seeks proposals from multiple vendors for a new product or innovation and chooses to partner with a particular vendor another vendor may claim the company infringed its intellectual property rights by using information gathered from the vendor proposals the company could incur material legal costs and related expenses to defend against such claims and the company could incur significant costs associated with discontinuing to use provide or manufacture certain products services or trademarks even if it is ultimately found not to have infringed such rights 

an increase in the value of the company’s glad ® business would result in an increase in the company’s purchase obligation for the procter  gamble company’s pg’s 20 interest in that business which may adversely affect the company’s net earnings and cash flow additionally it is uncertain whether the company’s net earnings and cash flow would be adversely affected more by an extension or a termination of the agreement related to the glad ® business 

in january 2003 the company entered into a venture agreement with pg related to the company’s glad ® bags wraps and containers business in connection with this agreement pg provides research and development support to the glad ® business the agreement with pg will expire in january 2023 unless the parties decide on or prior to january 2018 to extend the term of the agreement for another 10 years 

unless extended the agreement will require the company to purchase pg’s 20 interest in january 2023 for cash at fair value as of june 30 2016 the estimated fair value of pg’s interest was 448 million of which 302 million has been recognized by the company and is reflected in other liabilities in the company’s june 30 2016 consolidated balance sheet the difference between the estimated fair value and the amount recognized and any future changes in the fair value of pg’s interest is charged to cost of products sold on a straight line basis over the remaining life of the agreement the estimated fair value of pg’s interest increased significantly in 2016 and may continue to change up until any such purchase by the company of pg’s interest any additional significant increases in the fair value of such interest may adversely affect the company’s net earnings and cash flow 

if the company and pg decide not to extend the term of the agreement this decision may harm the terms on which the company has access to innovation from pg alternatively if the company and pg decide to extend the term of the agreement there can be no assurance that any future innovation will result in either case net earnings and cash flow may be negatively impacted for additional information see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in exhibit 991 

the company’s substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its business operations and financial results and prevent the company from fulfilling its obligations and the company may incur substantially more debt in the future which could exacerbate these risks 

as of june 30 2016 the company had over 2 billion of debt the company’s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

 additionally failure by the company to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in its debt documents could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could have a significant adverse effect on the company further certain terms of the agreements governing the company’s overthecounter derivative instruments contain provisions that require the company’s credit ratings as assigned by standard  poor’s and moody’s to the company and its counterparties to remain at a level equal to or better than the minimum of an investment grade credit rating as of june 30 2016 the company and each of its counterparties had been assigned investmentgrade ratings with both standard  poor’s and moody’s however if the company’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade the counterparties to the derivative instruments in net liability positions could request full collateralization 

the company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions repurchase shares or fund other activities for general business purposes subject to compliance with the company’s existing restrictive debt covenants as of june 30 2016 the company could add approximately 2 billion in incremental debt and remain in compliance with restrictive debt covenants although the actual amount that the company may be able to borrow in the future may not equal this amount if new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that the company now faces could intensify in addition the cost of incurring additional debt could increase due to possible downgrades in the company’s credit rating economic conditions or otherwise in this regard failure to maintain the companys credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate in future financings liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

the company is subject to risks related to its discontinued operations in venezuela 

on september 22 2014 the company’s venezuela subsidiary announced that it was discontinuing its operations effective immediately and seeking to sell its assets on september 26 2014 the company reported that venezuelan vice president jorge arreaza announced with endorsement by president nicolás maduro that the venezuelan government had occupied the production facilities of the company’s venezuela subsidiary on november 6 2014 the company reported that the venezuelan government had published a resolution granting a governmentsponsored special administrative board full authority to restart and operate the business formerly operated by the company’s venezuela subsidiary thereby reaffirming the government’s expropriation of its assets further president nicolás maduro announced the government’s intention to facilitate the resumed production of bleach and other cleaning products at the venezuela plants the venezuelan government’s actions raise grave concerns as the production of cleaning products in particular bleach is a highly specialized and technical process any restarting of operations in venezuela is or would be without the consent or involvement of the company and its affiliates and any resumed production processes would be outside the company’s control the company has advised repeatedly that it and its affiliates cannot be responsible for the safety of any workers and the surrounding communities or for the safety quality or effectiveness of any product that may be produced under the venezuelan government’s takeover or any use of the names and trademarks of the company and its affiliates nevertheless the company may face liabilities or costs associated with any such unauthorized resumption of operations by the venezuelan government or others 

the company may not continue to pay dividends or repurchase its stock 

although the company has historically declared and paid quarterly cash dividends on its common stock and has been authorized to repurchase its shares subject to certain limitations under its share repurchase programs any determinations by the board of directors to continue to declare and pay cash dividends on the company’s common stock or to repurchase the company’s common stock will be based primarily upon the company’s financial condition results of operations and business requirements the price of its common stock in the case of the repurchase program and the board of directors’ continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration and payment of dividends are in the best interests of the company’s stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs the company’s ability to continue to declare and pay cash dividends will depend upon among other things its cash balances and future cash requirements results of operations financial condition and net earnings all of which are subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond the company’s control in the event the company does not declare and pay a quarterly dividend or discontinues its share repurchases the company’s stock price could be adversely affected 

the company’s continued growth and expansion and reliance on thirdparty service providers could adversely affect its internal control over financial reporting which could harm its business and financial results

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties set forth below as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report or in other filings by the company with the sec could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the company or that are not currently believed by the company to be material may also harm the company’s business operations and financial results 

the company faces intense competition in its markets which could lead to reduced net sales profitability and cash flow 

the company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the united states and in its international markets most of the company’s products compete with other widely advertised brands within each product category the company also faces competition from retailers including club stores dollar stores and mass merchandisers which are increasingly offering “private label” brands that are typically sold at lower prices and compete with the company’s products in certain categories during times of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more “private label” or other economy brands increased purchases of “private label” products could reduce sales volumes of the company’s highermargin products or there could be a shift in product mix to lowermargin offerings 

the company’s products generally compete on the basis of product performance brand recognition price value or other benefits to consumers advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have significant impacts on consumer purchasing decisions and the company is increasingly using digital media marketing and promotional programs to reach consumers a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it typically requires continued advertising promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position if the company’s advertising marketing and promotional programs including its use of digital media to reach consumers are not effective or adequate the company’s sales and volume may be negatively impacted 

some of the company’s competitors are larger than the company and have greater financial resources these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the company can in addition the company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the company competitive activity may require the company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions andor reduce prices which could lead to reduced profits and adversely affect growth 

uncertain worldwide regional and local economic conditions and financial market volatility may negatively impact the company and consumers of its products which would negatively affect the company’s financial performance and liquidity 

although the company continues to devote significant resources to support its brands uncertain economic conditions may continue to negatively affect consumer demand for the company’s products consumers may also be sensitive to economic uncertainty or unfavorable economic conditions and reduce discretionary spending which may lead to reduced sales volumes or cause a shift in the company’s product mix from highermargin to lowermargin products consumers may increase purchases of lowerpriced or “private label” products and the company’s competitors may increase levels of advertising and promotional activity for lowerpriced products as they seek to maintain sales volumes during uncertain economic times which may negatively impact the company’s sales and volume 

global markets continued to experience significant disruptions during fiscal year 2015 and continuing volatility particularly in argentina could continue to harm the company’s business in addition financial market volatility could adversely affect the company’s liquidity and capital resources uncertain economic conditions and financial market volatility may also adversely affect the financial condition of the company’s customers suppliers and other business partners if customers’ financial conditions are severely affected customers may reduce their purchases of the company’s products or the company may not be able to collect accounts receivable each of which could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operations or financial results 

sales growth objectives may be difficult to achieve and price increases market and category declines and changes to the company’s product and geographic mix may adversely impact the company’s financial results 

a large percentage of the company’s revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition during fiscal year 2015 approximately 82 of the company’s net sales were generated in us markets us markets for cleaning products are generally characterized by high household penetration the company’s ability to achieve sales growth depends on its ability to drive growth through innovation expansion into new product categories channels and countries investment in its established brands and enhanced merchandising and its ability to capture market share from competitors if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product improvements undertake sales marketing and advertising initiatives that grow its product categories and develop acquire or successfully launch new products it may not achieve its sales growth objectives even when the company is successful in increasing market share within particular product categories a decline in the markets for such product categories can have a negative impact on the company’s financial results 

in addition changes to the mix of products the company sells as well as the mix of countries in which its products are sold can adversely impact the company’s operating expenses the amount of revenue and the timing of revenue recognition which could cause its profitability and cash flow to suffer the company’s financial outlook assumes a certain volume and product mix of sales and if actual results vary from this projected volume and product mix of sales the company’s operations and results could be negatively affected 

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations 

in fiscal year 2015 approximately 18 of the company’s net sales were generated in international markets including approximately 4 of the company’s net sales in argentina the company faces and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations including the following 

  7 

 argentina presents a difficult operating environment including price controls on some of the company’s products a devaluing currency and inflation more broadly the risks described above could have a significant adverse impact on the company’s ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position for example the company’s inability to raise prices as a result of price controls could continue to adversely affect the company’s margins profitability and cash flow and make it difficult for the company to offset other risks such as high inflation the company’s small sales volume in some countries relative to some multinational and local competitors could exacerbate such risks 

in addition the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks with respect to its sales profits and cash flow driven by movements of the us dollar relative to other currencies although the company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks these hedges only offset a small portion of the company’s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and therefore the company’s reported earnings may be negatively affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 

inflation is another risk associated with the company’s international operations for example argentina could in the future be designated as a highly inflationary economy gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of nonus dollar monetary assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in net earnings other countries in which the company operates may also become highly inflationary or such countries’ currencies may be devalued or both which may negatively impact the company’s operations and financial results 

for further information regarding argentina see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in exhibit 991 

the company is subject to risks related to its discontinued operations in venezuela 

on september 22 2014 the company’s venezuela subsidiary announced that it was discontinuing its operations effective immediately and seeking to sell its assets on september 26 2014 the company reported that venezuelan vice president jorge arreaza announced with endorsement by president nicolás maduro that the venezuelan government had occupied the production facilities of the company’s venezuela subsidiary on november 6 2014 the company reported that the venezuelan government had published a resolution granting a governmentsponsored special administrative board full authority to restart and operate the business formerly operated by the company’s venezuela subsidiary thereby reaffirming the government’s expropriation of its assets further president nicolás maduro announced the government’s intention to facilitate the resumed production of bleach and other cleaning products at the venezuela plants the venezuelan government’s actions raise grave concerns as the production of cleaning products in particular bleach is a highly specialized and technical process any restarting of operations in venezuela is or would be without the consent or involvement of the company and its affiliates and any resumed production processes would be outside the company’s control the company has advised repeatedly that it and its affiliates cannot be responsible for the safety of any workers and the surrounding communities or for the safety quality or effectiveness of any product that may be produced under the venezuelan government’s takeover or any use of the names and trademarks of the company and its affiliates nevertheless the company may face liabilities or costs associated with any such unauthorized resumption of operations by the venezuelan government or others 

volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials energy transportation labor and other necessary supplies or services could harm the company’s profits and cash flow 

volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials including resin sodium hypochlorite linerboard soybean oil solvent corrugated cardboard and other chemicals and agricultural commodities or increases in the cost of energy transportation labor and other necessary supplies or services may harm the company’s profits and operating results we distribute our products and receive raw materials primarily by rail and truck reduced availability of rail or trucking could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and impair our ability to distribute our products or receive our raw materials in a timely manner 

the company believes commodity and other cost increases are possible in the future if such increases occur or exceed the company’s estimates and the company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases its profits and operating results will be harmed in addition if the company increases the prices of its products in response to increases in the cost of commodities and commodity costs decline the company may not be able to sustain its price increases sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or customers may decide not to pay the higher prices which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share while the company seeks to project tradeoffs between price increases and volume its projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 

to reduce the cost volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases the company uses derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps the extent of the company’s derivative position at any given time depends on the company’s assessment of the markets for these commodities the cost volatility in the markets and the cost of the derivative instruments many of the commodities used by the company in its products do not have actively traded derivative instruments if the company does not or is unable to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if it institutes a position and costs subsequently decrease the company’s costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than its competitors’ costs and the company’s financial results could be adversely affected for further information regarding the company’s use of derivative instruments see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in exhibit 991 

reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in disruptions to the company’s business 

the company relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain commodities and raw material inputs including solesource and singlesource suppliers for certain of its raw materials packaging product components finished products and other necessary supplies new suppliers may have to be qualified under governmental industry and company standards which can require additional investment and time the company could experience disruptions in production and its financial results and relationships with customers could be adversely affected if the company is unable to qualify any needed new suppliers or maintain supplier arrangements and relationships if it is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity quality and price levels needed for its business or if any of the company’s key suppliers becomes insolvent experiences financial distress or environmental economic or other outside factors impact its operations 

the company may not successfully develop and introduce new products and line extensions or successfully expand into adjacent categories and countries which could adversely impact its financial results 

the company’s future performance and growth depends on innovation and its ability to successfully develop or license and introduce new products brands line extensions and product improvements or enter into or expand into adjacent product categories sales channels or countries the company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve its innovation goals the development and introduction of new products require substantial and effective research and development and marketing expenditures which the company may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance in addition effective and integrated systems are required for the company to gather and use consumer data and information to successfully market its products new product development and marketing efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays which could result in the company not being first to market and the failure of new products brands and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance if product introductions or new or expanded adjacencies are not successful costs associated with these efforts may not be fully recouped and the company’s profits could be adversely affected in addition if sales generated by new products cause a decline in sales of the company’s existing products the company’s operating and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

dependence on key customers could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the company’s net sales net sales to the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates were 26 27 and 27 of consolidated net sales for each of the fiscal years ended june 30 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively and occurred in each of the company’s reportable segments no other individual customer accounted for more than 10 of consolidated net sales in any of these fiscal years during fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 the company’s five largest customers accounted for 45 of its consolidated net sales for each of the three fiscal years the company expects that a significant portion of its revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers as a result changes in the strategies of the company’s largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to “private label” or competitors’ products may harm the company’s sales and reduce the ability of the company to offer new innovative and improved products to consumers 

in addition the company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders and the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its customers accordingly these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the company at any time and for any reason if the company does not effectively respond to the demands of its customers they could decrease their purchases from the company causing the company’s sales and profits to decline furthermore unfavorable market conditions or competitive pressures may cause the company’s customers to reevaluate the number and mix of brands they sell resulting in lower purchases of the company’s products by these customers 

the company continues to see retailer consolidation both in the united states and internationally this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailers who may change their business strategies demand lower pricing or special packaging or impose other burdensome requirements on product suppliers these business demands may relate to inventory practices logistics a shift in focus away from branded products toward “private label” or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship these large consolidated companies could also exert additional competitive pressure on the company’s other customers which could in turn lead to such customers demanding lower pricing or special packaging or imposing other onerous requirements on the company if the company ceases doing business with a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease due to customer inventory reductions or otherwise the company’s business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

government regulations could impose material costs 

generally the manufacture packaging labeling storage distribution and advertising of the company’s products and the conduct of its business operations must all comply with extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations for example in the united states many of the company’s products are regulated by the environmental protection agency the food and drug administration and the consumer product safety commission and the company’s product claims and advertising are regulated by the federal trade commission among other regulatory agencies most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies the company’s international operations are also subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products there is also a risk of potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and related difficulties in maintaining effective internal controls additionally the company could be subject to inquiries or investigations by governmental and other regulatory bodies any determination that the company’s operations or activities are not in compliance with applicable law could expose the company to significant fines penalties or other sanctions that may harm the business and reputation of the company 

in particular because of the company’s extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of the foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws the foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees jointventure partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

it is expected that federal state and foreign governments will continue to introduce new and expanded legislation affecting the company’s operations which may require the company to increase its resources capabilities and expertise in such areas for example the company is subject to regulations regarding the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment including as a result of evolving climate change standards and new and increased regulation in other areas such as with respect to “conflict minerals” such regulation could negatively impact the company’s ability to obtain raw materials or could increase its acquisition and compliance costs in addition pending legislative initiatives and adopted legislation in the areas of healthcare reform and other areas such as the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and legislation in the area of taxation of domestic and foreign profits executive compensation and corporate governance could also increase the company’s costs these risks may be increased by the company’s acquisitions of healthlink and aplicare inc which manufacture products subject to additional regulations 

if the company is found to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas it could be subject to civil remedies including fines import detentions injunctions product withdrawals or recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations particularly with respect to its charcoal business could delay or prevent the company from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results as the company expands its natural personal care and healthcare businesses such as through burt’s bees ®  healthlink ®  aplicare ® and caltech industries an increasing number of its products have and will become subject to regulations and laws relating to drugs and medical devices in order to comply with these laws and regulations the company may be required to make changes to product formulation labeling or marketing claims perform additional testing to substantiate its product claims make costly changes in its manufacturing processes or supply chain or stop selling certain products until corrective actions have been taken 

cyberattacks privacy breaches or a failure of key information technology systems could adversely impact the company’s ability to conduct business 

the company relies extensively on information technology systems many of which are managed by thirdparty service providers in order to conduct its business these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to communicating within the company and with customers consumers and other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping products to customers processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal and tax requirements and implementing other processes involved in managing the business the company has made significant progress with its implementation of enterprisewide upgrades to its hardware software and operating systems including its enterprise system in latin america which replaced legacy systems and is expected to streamline operations and enable future growth however legacy systems remain in countries where the company conducts business outside of the united states and latin america if the company’s existing andor future technology systems thirdparty service providers and processes do not adequately support the future growth of the company’s business the company’s business may be adversely impacted 

although the company has network security measures in place the systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses security breaches and other disruptions from unauthorized users or system failures including internet outages while the company has business continuity plans in place if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes including catastrophic events power outages security breaches or other similar events and if the business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage or conduct business which may adversely impact the company’s business furthermore the company sells its burt’s bees ® natural personal care products and other products directly to consumers online provides websites mobile apps and connected devices and offers promotions rebates customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information and it or its vendors could experience cyberattacks or other incidents that result in unauthorized disclosure of consumer customer employee or company information the company understands that in august 2015 the federal government brought an indictment against brokers and hackers for stealing advanced nonpublic press releases of various public companies from news wires and trading on securities using the information from such press releases if the company suffers a loss as a result of a breach or other breakdown in its technology system or such a breach or other breakdown including such cyberattack or other incident involving one of the company’s vendors results in unauthorized disclosure of business financial personal or stakeholder information the company may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm and may be exposed to legal liability which may adversely affect the company’s results of operations andor financial condition in addition if the company’s service providers suppliers or customers experience such a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in the company’s supply chain or reduced customer orders which would adversely affect the company’s operations 

acquisitions new venture investments and divestitures may not be successful which could impact the company’s operations and financial results 

in connection with the company’s strategy the company expects to continue to seek to increase growth through acquisitions not only is it difficult to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic acquisitions at attractive prices but these transactions also involve numerous risks including risks relating to the company’s ability to 

 12 

acquired companies or operations or newly created ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability and cash flow that justify the investments future acquisitions or ventures could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt the assumption of contingent liabilities including litigation an increase in expenses related to certain assets and increased operating expenses all of which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would subject the company to local regulations and could potentially lead to risks related to among other things increased exposure to foreign exchange rate changes government price control repatriation of profits and liabilities relating to the foreign corrupt practices act in addition to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the company’s acquisitions diminish in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill intangible assets or other assets associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect its operating results 

the company may also divest certain assets businesses or brands that do not meet the company’s strategic objectives or growth targets with respect to any divestiture the company may encounter difficulty finding potential acquirers or other divestiture options on favorable terms any divestiture could affect the profitability of the company as a result of the gains or losses on such sale of a business or brand the loss of the operating income resulting from such sale or the costs or liabilities that are not assumed by the acquirer ie stranded costs that may negatively impact profitability and cash flow subsequent to any divestiture the company may also be required to recognize impairment charges as a result of a divesture 

in addition any potential future acquisitions new ventures or divestitures may divert the attention of management and resources from matters that are core or critical to the company’s business 

profitability and cash flow could suffer if the company is unable to successfully implement its strategies generate anticipated cost savings and efficiencies or efficiently manage supply chain and manufacturing processes 

the company continues to implement plans to improve its competitive position by setting aggressive annual cost savings targets and it expects ongoing cost savings from its continuous improvement activities the company anticipates these continuing cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing inefficiencies and realizing productivity gains distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions if the company cannot successfully implement its cost savings plans or the cost of making these changes increases the company may not realize all anticipated benefits which could adversely affect its financial results or its longterm strategies such as the 2020 strategy which includes financial goals such as annual net sales growth of 35 market share growth annual ebit margin growth between 2550 basis points and annual free cash flow as a percentage of net sales of about 1012 the company also continues to seek to penetrate new markets and introduce new products and product improvements these goals and strategies may not be implemented or may fail to achieve desired results in addition the company expects to continue to restructure its operations as necessary to improve operational efficiency including occasionally closing facilities or plants gaining additional efficiencies may become increasingly difficult over time there may be onetime costs relating to facility closures or other restructurings and anticipated cost savings and the company’s strategies may not be implemented or may fail to achieve desired results if the company is unable to implement its strategies or if its strategies do not achieve the intended effects if it does not realize cost savings and other efficiencies or if it is unable to efficiently manage its supply chain and manufacturing processes the company’s financial results could suffer these plans and strategies could also have a negative impact on the company’s relationships with employees or customers which could also adversely affect the company’s financial results 

product liability commercial claims or other legal proceedings could adversely affect the company’s sales and operating results including cash flow 

the company has in the past paid and may be required in the future to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products such claims may be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants or provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use or damage property or persons product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation sales and operating results in addition if any of the company’s products is found to be defective the company may recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims may be subject to a retention exceed the amount of insurance coverage or be excluded under the terms of the policies 

in addition the company is and may in the future become a party to litigation and other disputes including advertising disputes with competitors consumer class actions labor claims securities litigation and litigation in foreign jurisdictions in general claims made by or against the company in litigation disputes or other proceedings have been and can in the future be expensive and timeconsuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements injunctions or damages that could significantly affect its business or financial results or condition it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation disputes or proceedings with which the company currently is or may in the future become involved the impact of these matters on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition could be material see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the notes to consolidated financial statements in exhibit 991 for additional information related to these matters including litigation related to its discontinued operations in brazil 

loss of or inability to attract key personnel could adversely impact the company’s business 

the company’s success depends in part on its ability to retain its key personnel including its executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of one or more of the company’s key employees could disrupt its business the company’s success also depends in part on its continuing ability to identify hire train and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense especially in the san francisco bay area where the company’s headquarters and largest research facility are located as the company expands into new categories or markets including more regulated businesses it will also require personnel with relevant training and experience in such categories or markets the company may not be able to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future and its failure to do so could adversely affect its business 

harm to the company’s reputation or the reputation of one or more of its leading brands could have an adverse effect on the business 

maintaining a strong reputation with consumers customers and trade partners is critical to the success of the company’s business the company devotes significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve the company’s reputation and the reputation of its brands these programs include ethics and compliance sustainability and product safety and quality initiatives despite these efforts negative publicity about the company including product safety quality efficacy or similar concerns whether real or perceived could occur and the company’s products could face withdrawal recall or other quality issues the company also licenses certain of its brands to third parties which creates additional exposure for those brands to product safety quality and other concerns in addition widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination negative or inaccurate publicity posts or comments about the company or its brands or disclosure of nonpublic sensitive information about the company could be widely disseminated through the use of social media such events if they were to occur could harm the company’s image and adversely affect its business as well as require resources to rebuild the company’s reputation 

environmental matters create potential liabilities that could adversely affect the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to air emissions water discharges handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances and climate change the company has incurred and will continue to incur significant expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations and such expenditures reduce the cash flow available to the company for other purposes 

the company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its current and former facilities in addition some of its present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many years and over that time some of those facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that those sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom the company has sent waste may be identified and become the subject of remediation the company could also become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 

the company had a recorded liability of 12 million and 14 million as of june 30 2015 and 2014 respectively for its share of aggregate future remediation costs related to certain environmental matters including response actions at various locations one matter in dickinson county michigan for which the company is jointly and severally liable accounts for a substantial majority of the recorded liability as of both june 30 2015 and 2014 see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the notes to consolidated financial statements in exhibit 991 for additional information related to these liabilities 

the company also handles andor transports hazardous substances including but not limited to chlorine at some of its international plant sites a release of such chemicals whether in transit or at the company’s facilities due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability and business disruptions 

the facilities of the company and its suppliers are subject to disruption by events beyond the company’s control 

operations at facilities of the company its suppliers service providers and retail customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages demonstrations disease outbreaks or pandemics acts of war terrorism fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters the company’s corporate headquarters and primary research and development facility are located near major earthquake fault lines in california if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment temporary loss of access to critical data delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations any such disruption could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business 

failure to maximize successfully assert or successfully defend the company’s intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness 

the company relies on intellectual property rights based on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its brands products and packaging for its products the company cannot be certain that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions the company cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be invalidated circumvented or challenged and the company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert its intellectual property rights or to defend those rights from assertions of invalidity in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if other parties infringe the company’s intellectual property rights they may dilute the value of the company’s brands in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the company’s brands and harm its sales the failure to perfect or successfully assert its intellectual property rights could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

if the company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others its competitiveness could be negatively impacted 

if the company is found to have violated the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of thirdparty ideas or technologies such a finding could result in the need to cease use of a trademark trade secret copyrighted work or patented invention in the company’s business and the obligation to pay a substantial amount for past infringement if holders are willing to permit the company to continue to use such intellectual property rights they could require a payment of a substantial amount for continued use of those rights either ceasing use or paying such amounts could cause the company to become less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

even if the company is not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights claims of infringement could adversely affect the company’s business for example if the company seeks proposals from multiple vendors for a new product or innovation and chooses to partner with a particular vendor another vendor may claim the company infringed its intellectual property rights by using information gathered from the vendor proposals the company could incur material legal costs and related expenses to defend against such claims 

the company’s substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its operations and financial results and prevent the company from fulfilling its obligations and the company may incur substantially more debt in the future which could exacerbate these risks 

as of june 30 2015 the company had over 2 billion of debt including 300 million of senior unsecured notes that mature in fiscal year 2016 the company’s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

 additionally failure by the company to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in its debt documents could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could have a significant adverse effect on the company further certain terms of the agreements governing the company’s overthecounter derivative instruments contain provisions that require the company’s credit ratings as assigned by standard  poor’s and moody’s to the company and its counterparties to remain at a level equal to or better than the minimum of an investment grade credit rating as of june 30 2015 the company and each of its counterparties had been assigned investmentgrade ratings with both standard  poor’s and moody’s however if the company’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade the counterparties to the derivative instruments in net liability positions could request full collateralization 

the company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions repurchase shares or fund other activities for general business purposes subject to compliance with the company’s existing restrictive debt covenants as of june 30 2015 the company could add approximately 2 billion in incremental debt and remain in compliance with restrictive debt covenants although the actual amount that the company may be able to borrow in the future may not equal this amount if new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that the company now faces could intensify in addition the cost of incurring additional debt could increase due to possible downgrades in the company’s credit rating economic conditions or otherwise 

the company may not continue to pay dividends or repurchase its stock 

although the company has historically declared and paid quarterly cash dividends on its common stock and has been authorized to repurchase its shares subject to certain limitations under its share repurchase programs any determinations by the board of directors to continue to declare and pay cash dividends on the company’s common stock or to repurchase the company’s common stock will be based primarily upon the company’s financial condition results of operations and business requirements the price of its common stock in the case of the repurchase program and the board of directors’ continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration and payment of dividends are in the best interests of the company’s stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs the company’s ability to continue to declare and pay cash dividends will depend upon among other things its cash balances and future cash requirements results of operations financial condition and net earnings all of which are subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond the company’s control in the event the company does not declare and pay a quarterly dividend or discontinues its share repurchases the company’s stock price could be adversely affected 

the company’s continued growth and expansion and reliance on thirdparty service providers could adversely affect its internal control over financial reporting which could harm its business and financial results 

clorox management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the company’s financial statements would be prevented or detected the company’s continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets will place significant additional pressure on the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting moreover the company engages the services of third parties to assist with business operations and financial reporting processes which injects additional monitoring obligations and risk into the system of internal control any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the company’s ability to report its financial results accurately and on a timely basis or to detect and prevent fraud 

the company’s judgments regarding the accounting for tax positions and the resolution of tax disputes may impact the company’s earnings and cash flow 

significant judgment is required to determine the company’s effective tax rate and evaluate its tax positions the company provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement criteria prescribed by applicable accounting standards fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties may impact the company’s effective tax rate and the company’s financial results when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate which would have an adverse effect on the company’s operating results any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution for additional information see the information set forth in the notes to consolidated financial statements in exhibit 991 

the estimates and assumptions on which the company’s financial statement projections are based may prove to be inaccurate which may cause its actual results to materially differ from such projections which may adversely affect the company’s future cash flows and stock price 

the company’s financial statement projections are dependent on certain estimates and assumptions related to among other things category growth market share projections product pricing foreign exchange rates commodity prices cost savings accruals for estimated liabilities including litigation reserves goodwill market share projections measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans and the company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in its existing business fund internal growth repurchase its shares make acquisitions pay dividends and meet debt obligations while the company’s projections are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made the company’s actual results may differ materially from its financial outlook any material variation between the company’s projections and its actual results may adversely affect the company’s future cash flows and stock price 

the company’s business could be negatively impacted as a result of stockholder activism or an unsolicited takeover proposal or a proxy contest 

in recent years proxy contests and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies including the company during fiscal years 2012 and 2011 the company was the target of an unsolicited takeover proposal from a stockholder activist which resulted in significant costs to the company if such a proposal were to be made again the company would incur significant costs which would have an adverse effect on the company’s financial results stockholder activists may also seek to involve themselves in the governance strategic direction and operations of the company such proposals may disrupt the company’s business and divert the attention of the company’s management and employees and any perceived uncertainties as to the company’s future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities the perception that the company needs a change in the direction of its business the perception that the company is unstable or lacks continuity which may be exploited by our competitors and cause concern to our current or potential customers and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners which could adversely affect the company’s business in addition actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties set forth below as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report or in other filings by the company with the sec could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the company or that are not currently believed by the company to be material may also harm the company’s business operations and financial results 

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations 

in fiscal year 2014 approximately 20 of the company’s net sales were generated in international markets the company faces and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations including 

challenges in venezuela where the company’s business and cash flows have been and continue to be adversely impacted by governmental restrictions such as currency exchange price and margin controls as well as other difficult operating conditions challenges in argentina where the devaluation of the argentine peso has negatively affected the company’s net sales and net earnings economic or political instability particularly in venezuela and argentina price controls and related government actions particularly in venezuela and argentina foreign currency fluctuations currency controls and inflation which may adversely affect the company’s ability to do business in certain markets and reduce the us dollar value of revenues profits or cash flows it receives from nonus markets difficulty in obtaining nonlocal currency eg us dollars to pay for the raw materials needed to manufacture the company’s products and contractmanufactured products particularly in venezuela and argentina restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the united states including possible taxes or withholding obligations on any repatriations particularly in venezuela and argentina the imposition of tariffs trade restrictions import and export laws or other government actions generating a negative impact on the company’s business the possibility of nationalization expropriation of assets or other similar government actions particularly in venezuela and argentina difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified local employees civil unrest work stoppages and labor disputes difficulties in obtaining or unavailability of raw materials increased credit risk of local customers suppliers and distributors difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights and challenges relating to enforcement of or compliance with laws many of the risks described above are particularly acute in venezuela the operating environment in venezuela is challenging with high inflation political instability governmental restrictions in the form of currency exchange price and margin controls and the possibility of government actions such as further devaluations business occupations and intervention or expropriation of assets for nearly three years more than two thirds of the company’s products in venezuela have been subject to price controls despite significant doubledigit inflation in addition the foreign exchange controls in venezuela limit the venezuela business’s ability to remit dividends and pay intercompany balances for further information regarding venezuela see “ venezuela ” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on page 9 of exhibit 991 hereto 

argentina also presents a difficult operating environment including price controls on some of the company’s products a devaluing currency and inflation in addition in july 2014 the argentine government defaulted on debt payment agreements for further information regarding argentina see “ argentina ” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on page 11 of exhibit 991 hereto 

more broadly the risks described above could have a significant adverse impact on the company’s ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position for example lower prices resulting from price controls could continue to adversely affect the company’s margins profitability and cash flow and make it difficult for the company to offset other risks such as high inflation the company’s small sales volume in some countries relative to some multinational and local competitors could exacerbate such risks 

in addition the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its sales profits and cash flow driven by movements of the us dollar relative to other currencies although the company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks these hedges only offset a small portion of the company’s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and therefore the company’s reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 

inflation is another risk associated with the company’s international operations for example venezuela has been designated for financial reporting purposes as a highly inflationary economy and argentina could in the future be designated as such gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of nonus dollar monetary assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in net earnings other countries in which the company operates may also become highly inflationary or such countries’ currencies may be devalued or both which may negatively impact the company’s operations 

the company faces intense competition in its markets which could lead to reduced net sales profitability and cash flow 

the company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the united states and in its international markets most of the company’s products compete with other widely advertised brands within each product category the company also faces competition from retailers including club stores dollar stores and mass merchandisers which are increasingly offering “private label” brands that are typically sold at lower prices and compete with the company’s products in certain categories during times of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more private label or other economy brands increased purchases of private label products could reduce sales volumes of the company’s highermargin products or there could be a shift in product mix to lowermargin offerings 

the company’s products generally compete on the basis of product performance brand recognition price value or other benefits to consumers advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have significant impacts on consumer purchasing decisions and the company is increasingly using digital media marketing and promotional programs to reach consumers a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position if the company’s advertising marketing and promotional programs including its use of digital media to reach consumers are not effective or adequate the company’s sales and volume may be negatively impacted 

some of the company’s competitors are larger than the company and have greater financial resources these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the company can in addition the company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the company competitive activity may require the company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions andor reduce prices which could lead to reduced profits and adversely affect growth 

unfavorable worldwide regional and local economic conditions and financial market volatility may negatively impact the company and consumers of its products which would negatively affect the company’s financial performance and liquidity 

although the company continues to devote significant resources to support its brands unfavorable economic conditions may continue to negatively affect consumer demand for the company’s products consumers may also be sensitive to economic uncertainty or unfavorable economic conditions and reduce discretionary spending which may lead to reduced sales volumes or cause a shift in the company’s product mix from highermargin to lowermargin products consumers may increase purchases of lowerpriced or nonbranded products and the company’s competitors may increase levels of promotional activity for lowerpriced products as they seek to maintain sales volumes during uncertain economic times which may negatively impact the company’s sales and volume 

global markets continued to experience significant disruptions during fiscal year 2014 and continuing volatility particularly in venezuela and argentina could continue to harm the company’s business although the company currently generates significant cash flows from ongoing operations overall and has access to global credit markets through its financing activities and existing credit facilities to meet its current needs if the current credit conditions were to significantly worsen the company might not be able to access credit markets on favorable terms when needed which could adversely affect the company’s liquidity and capital resources financial market volatility and unfavorable economic conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of the company’s customers suppliers and other business partners if customers’ financial conditions are severely affected customers may reduce their purchases of the company’s products or the company may not be able to collect accounts receivable each of which could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results 

volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials energy transportation labor and other necessary supplies or services could harm the company’s profits and cash flow 

volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials including resin sodium hypochlorite linerboard soybean oil solvent corrugate and other chemicals and agricultural commodities or increases in the cost of energy transportation labor and other necessary supplies or services may harm the company’s profits and operating results the company anticipates continued commodity and other cost increases in fiscal year 2015 if such increases occur or exceed the company’s estimates and the company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases its profits and operating results will be harmed in addition if the company increases the prices of its products in response to increases in the cost of commodities and commodity costs decline the company may not be able to sustain its price increases sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or customers may decide not to pay the higher prices which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share while the company seeks to project tradeoffs between price increases and volume its projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations for further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity costs see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on page 17 of exhibit 991 hereto 

to reduce the cost volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases the company uses derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps the extent of the company’s derivative position at any given time depends on the company’s assessment of the markets for these commodities the cost volatility in the markets and the cost of the derivative instruments many of the commodities used by the company in its products do not have actively traded derivative instruments if the company does not or is unable to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if it institutes a position and costs subsequently decrease the company’s costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than its competitors’ costs and the company’s financial results could be adversely affected 

sales growth objectives may be difficult to achieve and price increases market and category declines and changes to the company’s product and geographic mix may adversely impact the company’s financial results 

a large percentage of the company’s revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition during fiscal year 2014 approximately 80 of the company’s net sales were generated in us markets us markets for cleaning products are generally characterized by high household penetration the company’s ability to achieve sales growth depends on its ability to drive growth through innovation investment in its established brands and enhanced merchandising and its ability to capture market share from competitors if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product improvements undertake sales marketing and advertising initiatives that grow its product categories and develop acquire or successfully launch new products it may not achieve its sales growth objectives even when the company is successful in increasing sales within particular product categories a continuing or accelerating decline in the overall markets for its products can have a negative impact on the company’s financial results 

in addition changes to the mix of products the company sells as well as the mix of countries in which its products are sold can adversely impact the company’s operating expenses the amount of revenue and the timing of revenue recognition which could cause its profitability and cash flow to suffer the company’s financial outlook assumes a certain volume and product mix of sales and if actual results vary from this projected volume and product mix of sales the company’s operations and results could be negatively affected 

dependence on key customers could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the company’s net sales net sales to the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates were 26 of consolidated net sales for each of the fiscal years ended 2014 2013 and 2012 and occurred in each of the company’s reportable segments no other customers accounted for more than 10 of consolidated net sales in any of these fiscal years during fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 the company’s five largest customers accounted for 45 45 and 44 of its net sales respectively and its ten largest customers accounted for 55 of its net sales for each of the three fiscal years the company expects that a significant portion of its revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers as a result changes in the strategies of the company’s largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to “private label” or competitors’ products may harm the company’s sales and reduce the ability of the company to bring new innovative and improved products to consumers 

in addition the company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders and the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its customers accordingly these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the company at any time and for any reason if the company does not effectively respond to the demands of its customers they could decrease their purchases from the company causing the company’s sales and profits to decline furthermore unfavorable market conditions or competitive pressures may cause the company’s customers to reevaluate the number and mix of brands they sell resulting in lower purchases of the company’s products by these customers 

the company continues to see retailer consolidation both in the united states and internationally this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailers who may change their business strategies demand lower pricing or special packaging or impose other requirements on product suppliers these business demands may relate to inventory practices logistics a shift in focus away from branded products toward private label or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship such consolidated companies could also exert additional competitive pressure on other customers of the company which could in turn negatively impact the company’s sales if the company ceases doing business with a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease due to customer inventory reductions or otherwise the company’s business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

government regulations could impose material costs 

generally the manufacture packaging labeling storage distribution and advertising of the company’s products and the conduct of its business operations must all comply with extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations for example in the united states many of the company’s products are regulated by the environmental protection agency the food and drug administration and the consumer product safety commission and the company’s product claims and advertising are regulated by the federal trade commission among other regulatory agencies most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies the company’s international operations are also subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products there is also a risk of potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and related difficulties in maintaining effective internal controls additionally the company could be subject to inquiries or investigations by governmental and other regulatory bodies any determination that the company’s operations or activities are not in compliance with the law including the foreign corrupt practices act could expose the company to significant fines penalties or other sanctions that may harm the business and reputation of the company 

it is expected that federal state and foreign governments will continue to introduce new and expanded legislation affecting the company’s operations for example the company is subject to regulations regarding the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment including as a result of evolving climate change standards and new and increased regulation in other areas such as with respect to “conflict minerals” such regulation could negatively impact the company’s ability to obtain raw materials or could increase its acquisition and compliance costs in addition pending legislative initiatives and adopted legislation in the areas of healthcare reform and other areas such as the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and legislation in the area of taxation of domestic and foreign profits executive compensation and corporate governance could also increase the company’s costs these risks may be increased by the company’s acquisitions of healthlink and aplicare inc which manufacture products subject to additional regulations 

if the company is found to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas it could be subject to civil remedies including fines import detentions injunctions product withdrawals or recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations particularly with respect to its charcoal business could delay or prevent the company from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results as the company expands its natural personal care and healthcare businesses such as through burt’s bees ®  healthlink ®  aplicare ®  caltech industries and clorox ® careconcepts™ an increasing number of its products have and will become subject to regulations and laws relating to drugs and medical devices in order to comply with these laws and regulations the company may be required to make changes to product formulation labeling or marketing claims  perform additional testing to substantiate its product claims  make costly changes in its manufacturing processes or supply chain or stop selling certain products until corrective actions have been taken 

reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in disruptions to the company’s business 

the company relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain commodities and raw material inputs including solesource and singlesource suppliers for certain of its raw materials packaging product components finished products and other necessary supplies new suppliers may have to be qualified under governmental industry and company standards which can require additional investment and time if the company is unable to qualify any needed new suppliers or maintain supplier arrangements and relationships if it is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity quality and price levels needed for its business or if any of the company’s key suppliers becomes insolvent experiences financial distress or environmental economic or other outside factors impact its operations the company could experience disruptions in production and its financial results and relationships with customers could be adversely affected 

profitability and cash flow could suffer if the company is unable to successfully implement its strategies generate anticipated cost savings and efficiencies or efficiently manage supply chain and manufacturing processes 

the company continues to implement plans to improve its competitive position by setting aggressive annual cost savings targets and it expects ongoing cost savings from its continuous improvement activities the company anticipates these continuing cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing inefficiencies and realizing productivity gains distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions if the company cannot successfully implement its cost savings plans or the cost of making these changes increases the company may not realize all anticipated benefits which could adversely affect its financial results in addition the company establishes longterm strategies such as the 2020 strategy which includes financial goals such as annual net sales growth of 35 market share growth annual ebit margin growth between 2550 basis points and annual free cash flow as a percentage of net sales of about 1012 the company also continues to seek to penetrate new markets and introduce new products and product improvements these goals and strategies may not be implemented or may fail to achieve desired results in addition the company expects to continue to restructure its operations as necessary to improve operational efficiency including occasionally closing facilities or plants gaining additional efficiencies may become increasingly difficult over time there may be onetime costs relating to facility closures or other restructurings and anticipated cost savings and the company’s strategies may not be implemented or may fail to achieve desired results if the company is unable to implement its strategies or if its strategies do not achieve the intended effects if it does not realize cost savings and other efficiencies or if it is unable to efficiently manage its supply chain and manufacturing processes the company’s financial results could suffer these plans and strategies could also have a negative impact on the company’s relationships with employees or customers which could also adversely affect the company’s financial results 

product liability commercial claims or other legal proceedings could adversely affect the company’s sales and operating results including cash flow 

the company has in the past paid and may be required in the future to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products such claims may be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants or provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use or damage property or persons product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation sales and operating results in addition if any of the company’s products is found to be defective the company may recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims may be subject to a retention  exceed the amount of insurance coverage or be excluded under the terms of the policies 

in addition the company is and may in the future become a party to litigation and other disputes including advertising disputes with competitors consumer class actions labor claims securities litigation and litigation in foreign jurisdictions in general claims made by or against the company in litigation disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and timeconsuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements injunctions or damages that could significantly affect its business or financial results or condition it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation disputes or proceedings with which the company currently is or may in the future become involved the impact of these matters on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition could be material see “contingencies” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on page 16 and note 11 – other contingencies and guarantees of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 46 of exhibit 991 hereto for additional information related to these matters including litigation related to its discontinued operations in brazil 

the company may not successfully develop and introduce new products and line extensions or successfully expand into adjacent categories and countries which could adversely impact its financial results 

the company’s future performance and growth depends on its innovation and ability to successfully develop or license and introduce new products brands line extensions and product improvements or enter into or expand into adjacent product categories sales channels or countries the company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve its innovation goals the development and introduction of new products require substantial and effective research development and marketing expenditures which the company may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance new product development and marketing efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays which could result in the company not being first to market and the failure of new products brands and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance if product introductions or new or expanded adjacencies are not successful costs associated with these efforts may not be fully recouped and the company’s profits could be adversely affected in addition if sales generated by new products cause a decline in sales of the company’s existing products the company’s financial results could be materially adversely affected 

acquisitions new venture investments and divestitures may not be successful which could impact the company’s results 

in connection with the company’s strategy the company expects to continue to seek to increase growth through acquisitions not only is it difficult to identify good acquisition candidates and to compete successfully for such candidates but these transactions also involve numerous risks including risks relating to the company’s ability to 

successfully integrate acquired companies products systems or personnel into the company’s existing business especially with respect to businesses or operations that are outside of the united states minimize any potential interruption to the ongoing business of the company or the acquired company successfully enter categories and markets in which the company may have limited or no prior experience achieve expected synergies and obtain the desired financial or strategic benefits from acquisitions retain key relationships with employees customers partners and suppliers of acquired companies and maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies throughout acquired companies acquired companies or operations or newly created ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability and cash flow that justify the investments future acquisitions or ventures could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt the assumption of contingent liabilities including litigation an increase in expenses related to certain assets and increased operating expenses all of which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would increase among other things the company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risks local regulations and potential liabilities relating to the foreign corrupt practices act in addition to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the company’s acquisitions diminish in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill intangible assets or other assets associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect its operating results 

the company may also divest certain assets businesses or brands that do not meet the company’s strategic objectives or growth targets with respect to any divestiture the company may encounter difficulty finding potential acquirers or other divestiture options on favorable terms any divestiture could affect the profitability of the company as a result of the gains or losses on such sale of a business or brand the loss of the operating income resulting from such sale or the costs or liabilities that are not assumed by the acquirer ie stranded costs that may negatively impact profitability and cash flow subsequent to any divestiture the company may also be required to recognize impairment charges as a result of a divesture 

any potential future acquisitions new ventures or divestitures may divert the attention of management and resources from matters that are core or critical to the business 

cyber attacks privacy breaches or a failure of key information technology systems could adversely impact the company’s ability to conduct business 

the company relies extensively on information technology systems many of which are managed by thirdparty service providers in order to conduct its business these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to communicating within the company and with customers consumers and other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping products to customers processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal and tax requirements and other processes involved in managing the business the company has made significant progress with its implementation of enterprisewide upgrades to its hardware software and operating systems including its enterprise system in latin america which replaced legacy systems and is expected to streamline operations and enable future growth however legacy systems remain in countries where the company conducts business outside of the united states and latin america if the company’s existing andor future technology systems thirdparty service providers and processes do not adequately support the future growth of the company’s business the company’s business may be adversely impacted 

although the company has network security measures in place the systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses security breaches and other disruptions from unauthorized users or system failures including internet outages while the company has business continuity plans in place if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes including catastrophic events power outages security breaches or other similar events and if the business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage or conduct business which may adversely impact the company’s business furthermore the company sells its burt’s bees ® and güd ® natural personal care products and kingsford ® lifestyle products directly to consumers online and offers customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information and it could experience cyber attacks or other incidents that result in unauthorized disclosure of consumer customer employee or company information if the company suffers a loss as a result of a breach or other breakdown in its technology system or such a breach or other breakdown results in unauthorized disclosure of business personal or stakeholder information the company may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm and may be exposed to legal liability which may adversely affect the company’s results of operations andor financial condition in addition if the company’s service providers suppliers or customers experience such a breach or unauthorized disclosure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in the company’s supply chain or reduced customer orders which would adversely affect the company’s operations 

loss of or inability to attract key personnel could adversely impact the company’s business 

the company’s success depends in part on its ability to retain its key personnel including its executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of one or more of the company’s key employees could disrupt its business the company’s success also depends in part on its continuing ability to identify hire train and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense especially in the san francisco bay area where the company’s headquarters and largest research facility are located as the company expands into new categories or markets including more regulated businesses it will also require personnel with relevant training and experience in such categories or markets the company may not be able to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future and its failure to do so could adversely affect its business 

harm to the company’s reputation or the reputation of one or more of its leading brands could have an adverse effect on the business 

maintaining a strong reputation with consumers customers and trade partners is critical to the success of the company’s business the company devotes significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve the company’s reputation and the reputation of its brands these programs include ethics and compliance sustainability and product safety and quality initiatives despite these efforts negative publicity about the company including product safety or similar concerns whether real or perceived could occur and the company’s products could face withdrawal recall or other quality issues the company also licenses certain of its brands to third parties which creates additional exposure for those brands to product safety quality and other concerns negative publicity posts or comments about the company or its brands could also be widely disseminated through the use of social media such events if they were to occur could harm the company’s image and adversely affect its business as well as require resources to rebuild the company’s reputation 

environmental matters create potential liabilities 

the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to air emissions water discharges handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances and climate change the company has incurred and will continue to incur significant expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations and such expenditures reduce the cash flow available to the company for other purposes 

the company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its current and former facilities in addition some of its present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many years and over that time some of those facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that those sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom the company has sent waste may be identified and become the subject of remediation the company could also become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 

the company had a recorded liability of 14 million and 13 million as of june 30 2014 and 2013 respectively for its share of aggregate future remediation costs related to certain environmental matters including response actions at various locations one matter in dickinson county michigan for which the company is jointly and severally liable accounts for a substantial majority of the recorded liability as of both june 30 2014 and 2013 the company has agreed to be liable for 243 of the aggregate remediation and associated costs for this matter pursuant to a costsharing arrangement with a third party with the assistance of environmental consultants the company maintains an undiscounted liability representing its current best estimate of its share of the capital expenditures maintenance and other costs that may be incurred over an estimated 30year remediation period currently the company cannot accurately predict the timing of future payments that may be made under this obligation in addition the company’s estimated loss exposure is sensitive to a variety of uncertain factors including the efficacy of remediation efforts changes in remediation requirements and the future availability of alternative cleanup technologies although it is reasonably possible that the company’s exposure may exceed the amount recorded any amount of such additional exposures or range of exposures is not estimable at this time see “contingencies” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on page 16 and note 11 – other contingencies and guarantees of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 46 of exhibit 991 hereto for additional information related to these liabilities 

the company also handles andor transports hazardous substances including but not limited to chlorine at some of its international plant sites a release of such chemicals whether in transit or at the company’s facilities due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability and business disruptions 

the facilities of the company and its suppliers are subject to disruption by events beyond the company’s control 

operations at facilities of the company its suppliers service providers and retail customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages demonstrations disease outbreaks or pandemics acts of war terrorism fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters the company’s corporate headquarters and primary research and development facility are located near major earthquake fault lines in california if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment temporary loss of access to critical data delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations any such disruption could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business 

failure to maximize successfully assert or successfully defend the company’s intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness 

the company relies on intellectual property rights based on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its brands products and packaging for its products the company cannot be certain that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions the company cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be invalidated circumvented or challenged and the company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert its intellectual property rights or to defend those rights from assertions of invalidity in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if other parties infringe the company’s intellectual property rights they may dilute the value of the company’s brands in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the company’s brands and harm its sales the failure to perfect or successfully assert its intellectual property rights could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

if the company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others its competitiveness could be negatively impacted 

if the company is found to have violated the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of thirdparty ideas or technologies such a finding could result in the need to cease use of a trademark trade secret copyrighted work or patented invention in the company’s business and the obligation to pay a substantial amount for past infringement if holders are willing to permit the company to continue to use such intellectual property rights it could also be necessary to pay a substantial amount in the future for those rights either ceasing use or paying such amounts could cause the company to become less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

even if the company is not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights claims of infringement could adversely affect the company’s business for example if the company seeks proposals from multiple vendors for a new product or innovation and chooses to partner with a particular vendor another vendor may claim the company infringed its intellectual property rights by using information gathered from the vendor proposals the company could incur material legal costs and related expenses to defend against such claims 

the company’s substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its operations and financial results and prevent the company from fulfilling its obligations and the company may incur substantially more debt in the future which could exacerbate these risks 

as of june 30 2014 the company had 23 billion of debt including 575 million of senior unsecured notes that mature in fiscal year 2015 the company’s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness which would reduce the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital requirements capital expenditures future acquisitions and other general corporate purposes limit the company’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to general adverse economic conditions or changes in its business and the industries in which it operates place the company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt and limit along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the company’s debt documents its ability to borrow additional funds additionally failure by the company to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in its debt documents could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could have a significant adverse effect on the company further certain terms of the agreements governing the company’s overthecounter derivative instruments contain provisions that require the company’s credit ratings as assigned by standard  poor’s and moody’s to the company and its counterparties to remain at a level equal to or better than the minimum of an investment grade credit rating as of june 30 2014 the company and each of its counterparties had been assigned investmentgrade ratings with both standard  poor’s and moody’s however if the company’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade the counterparties to the derivative instruments in net liability positions could request full collateralization 

the company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions repurchase shares or fund other activities for general business purposes subject to compliance with the company’s existing restrictive debt covenants as of june 30 2014 the company could add approximately 17 billion in incremental debt and remain in compliance with restrictive debt covenants although the actual amount that the company may be able to borrow in the future may not equal this amount if new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that the company now faces could intensify in addition the cost of incurring additional debt could increase due to possible downgrades in the company’s credit rating economic conditions or otherwise 

the company’s continued growth and expansion and reliance on thirdparty service providers could adversely affect its internal control over financial reporting which could harm its business and financial results 

clorox management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the company’s financial statements would be prevented or detected the company’s continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets will place significant additional pressure on the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting moreover the company engages the services of third parties to assist with business operations and financial reporting processes which injects additional monitoring obligations and risk into the system of internal control any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the company’s ability to report its financial results accurately and on a timely basis or to detect and prevent fraud 

the company’s judgments regarding the accounting for tax positions and the resolution of tax disputes may impact the company’s earnings and cash flow 

significant judgment is required to determine the company’s effective tax rate and evaluate its tax positions the company provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement criteria prescribed by applicable accounting standards fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties may impact the company’s effective tax rate and the company’s financial results when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate which would have an adverse effect on the company’s operating results any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution for additional information refer to the information set forth in note 17 – income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 53 of exhibit 991 hereto 

the estimates and assumptions on which the company’s financial statement projections are based may prove to be inaccurate which may cause its actual results to materially differ from such projections which may adversely affect the company’s future cash flows and stock price 

the company’s financial statement projections are dependent on certain estimates and assumptions related to among other things category growth market share projections foreign exchange rates commodity prices cost savings accruals for estimated liabilities including litigation reserves goodwill market share projections measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans and the company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in its existing business fund internal growth repurchase its shares make acquisitions pay dividends and meet debt obligations while the company’s projections are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made the company’s actual results may differ materially from its financial outlook any material variation between the company’s projections and its actual results may adversely affect the company’s stock price 

the company may not continue to pay dividends or repurchase its stock 

although the company has historically declared and paid quarterly cash dividends on its common stock and has been authorized to repurchase its shares subject to certain limitations under a share repurchase program any determinations to continue to declare and pay cash dividends on its common stock or to repurchase its common stock will be based primarily upon the company’s financial condition results of operations and business requirements the price of its common stock in the case of the repurchase program and the board of directors’ continuing determination that the repurchase program and the declaration and payment of dividends are in the best interests of the company’s stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs the company’s ability to continue to declare and pay cash dividends will depend upon among other things its cash balances and future cash requirements results of operations financial condition and net earnings all of which are subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond the company’s control in the event the company does not declare and pay a quarterly dividend or discontinues its share repurchases the company’s stock price could be adversely affected 

the company’s business could be negatively impacted as a result of stockholder activism or an unsolicited takeover proposal or a proxy contest 

in recent years proxy contests and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies including the company during fiscal years 2012 and 2011 the company was the target of an unsolicited takeover proposal from a stockholder activist which resulted in significant costs to the company if such a proposal were to be made again the company would incur significant costs which would have an adverse effect on the company’s financial results stockholder activists may also seek to involve themselves in the governance strategic direction and operations of the company such proposals may disrupt the company’s business and divert the attention of the company’s management and employees and any perceived uncertainties as to the company’s future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners which could adversely affect the company’s business

competition 

the markets for consumer products are highly competitive most of the company’s products compete with other nationally advertised brands within each category and with “private label” brands competition comes from similar and alternative products some of which are produced and marketed by major multinational or national companies having financial resources greater than those of the company depending on the product the company’s products compete on product performance brand recognition price value or other benefits to consumers a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising support if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support and ongoing product improvements to maintain its relative market position 

research and development

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties set forth below as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report or in other filings by the company with the sec could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the company or that are not currently believed by the company to be material may also harm the company’s business operations and financial results 

unfavorable worldwide regional and local economic conditions and financial market volatility may negatively impact the company’s financial performance and liquidity 

although the company continues to devote significant resources to support its brands unfavorable economic conditions may continue to negatively affect consumer demand for the company’s products consumers may reduce discretionary spending due to economic uncertainty or unfavorable economic conditions which may lead to reduced sales volumes or cause a shift in the company’s product mix from highermargin to lowermargin products consumers may increase purchases of lowerpriced or nonbranded products and the company’s competitors may increase levels of promotional activity for lowerpriced products as they seek to maintain sales volumes during uncertain economic times which may negatively impact the company’s sales and volume 

in addition global markets continued to experience significant disruptions during fiscal year 2013 and continuing volatility particularly in venezuela and argentina could continue to harm the company’s business although the company currently generates significant cash flows from ongoing operations and has access to global credit markets through its financing activities and existing credit facilities to meet its current needs if the current credit conditions were to worsen the company might not be able to access credit markets on favorable terms when needed which could adversely affect the company’s liquidity and capital resources financial market volatility and unfavorable economic conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of the company’s customers suppliers and other business partners if customers’ financial conditions are severely affected the company may not be able to collect accounts receivable which could have a material adverse impact on its results 

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations including exposure to foreign exchange rate risk 

the company faces and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations including 

economic or political instability in its international markets particularly in venezuela and argentina difficulty in obtaining nonlocal currency eg us dollars to pay for the raw materials needed to manufacture the company’s products and contractmanufactured products particularly in venezuela and argentina restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the united states including possible taxes or withholding obligations on any repatriations and the imposition of tariffs trade restrictions price controls or other governmental actions generating a negative impact on its business particularly in venezuela and argentina these risks could have a significant adverse impact on the company’s ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position for example lower prices resulting from price controls could adversely affect our margins and profitability and make it difficult for us to offset other risks in these markets such as high inflation the company’s small sales volume in some countries relative to some multinational and local competitors could exacerbate such risks 

in addition the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its sales profits assets and liabilities driven by movements of the us dollar relative to other currencies this risk is exacerbated by recent indications from the us federal reserve that it may reduce quantitative easing expansionary monetary policy which has created a general market environment whereby the us dollar has increased in value relative to a number of foreign currencies increasing volatility in foreign currency exchange markets although the company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks these hedges only offset a small portion of the company’s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and therefore its reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 

the company’s international operations are also subject to risks relating to potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations import and export laws raw material availability credit risk of local customers suppliers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences 

  

  

inflation is another risk associated with the company’s international operations for example venezuela has been designated for financial reporting purposes as a highly inflationary economy and argentina could in the future be designated as such gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of nonus dollar monetary assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in net earnings venezuela’s designation as a highly inflationary economy and the potential for further devaluation of the local currency exchange rate will continue to negatively affect the company’s revenue operating profit and net income in fiscal year 2014 and potentially beyond in addition there can be no assurance that other countries in which the company operates will not also become highly inflationary that such countries’ currencies will not be devalued or both and that the company’s operations will not be negatively impacted as a result for further information regarding venezuela see “venezuela” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on page 10 of exhibit 991 hereto 

the company faces intense competition in its markets which could lead to reduced profitability 

the company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the united states and in its international markets most of the company’s products compete with other widely advertised brands within each product category and with “private label” brands in certain categories which typically are sold at lower prices 

the company’s products generally compete on the basis of product performance brand recognition price value or other benefits to consumers advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have significant impacts on consumer purchasing decisions and the company is increasingly using digital media marketing and promotional programs to reach consumers a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position if the company’s advertising marketing and promotional programs including its use of digital media to reach consumers are not effective or adequate the company’s sales and volume may be impacted 

some of the company’s competitors are larger than the company and have greater financial resources these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the company can in addition the company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the company competitive activity may require the company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions andor reduce prices which could lead to reduced profits and adversely affect growth 

volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies or services could harm the company’s profits 

volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials including resin sodium hypochlorite linerboard soybean oil solvent corrugate and other chemicals and agricultural commodities or increases in the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services may harm the company’s profits and operating results the company anticipates continued commodity and other cost increases in fiscal year 2014 if such increases occur or exceed the company’s estimates and the company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases its profits and operating results will be harmed in addition if the company increases the prices of its products in response to increases in the cost of commodities and the commodity costs decline the company may not be able to sustain its price increases over time also competitors may not adjust their prices or customers may decide not to pay the higher prices which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume while the company seeks to project tradeoffs between price increases and volume its projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations for further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity costs see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on page 16 of exhibit 991 hereto 

to reduce the cost volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases the company uses derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps the extent of the company’s derivative position at any given time depends on the company’s assessment of the markets for these commodities the cost volatility in the markets and the cost of the derivative instruments many of the commodities used by the company in its products do not have actively traded derivative instruments if the company does not or is unable to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if it institutes a position and costs subsequently decrease the company’s costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than its competitors’ costs and the company’s financial results could be adversely affected 

sales growth objectives may be difficult to achieve and price increases market and category declines and changes to the company’s product and geographic mix may adversely impact the company’s financial results 

a large percentage of the company’s revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition during fiscal year 2013 approximately 79 of the company’s net sales were generated in us markets us markets for cleaning products are generally characterized by high household penetration the company’s ability to achieve sales growth depends on its ability to drive growth through innovation investment in its established brands and enhanced merchandising and its ability to capture market share from competitors if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product improvements undertake sales marketing and advertising initiatives that grow its product categories and develop acquire or successfully launch new products it may not achieve its sales growth objectives even when the company is successful in increasing sales within particular product categories a continuing or accelerating decline in the overall markets for its products can have a negative impact on the company’s financial results 

in addition changes to the mix of products the company sells as well as the mix of countries in which its products are sold can adversely impact the company’s operating expenses the amount of revenue and the timing of revenue recognition which could cause its profitability to suffer the company’s outlook assumes a certain volume and product mix of sales and if actual results vary from this projected volume and product mix of sales the company’s operations and results could be negatively affected 

dependence on key customers could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the company’s net sales net sales to the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates were 26 26 and 27 for the fiscal years ended 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively of consolidated net sales and occurred in each of the company’s reportable segments no other customers accounted for more than 10 of consolidated net sales in any of these fiscal years during fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 the company’s five largest customers accounted for 45 44 and 44 of its net sales respectively and its ten largest customers accounted for 55 of its net sales for each of the three fiscal years the company expects that a significant portion of its revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers as a result changes in the strategies of the company’s largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to “private label” or competitors’ products may harm the company’s sales and reduce the ability of the company to bring new innovative products to consumers 

in addition the company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders and the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its customers accordingly these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the company at any time and for any reason if the company does not effectively respond to the demands of its customers they could decrease their purchases from the company causing the company’s sales and profits to decline in recent years the company has seen increasing retailer consolidation both in the united states and internationally this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailers who may demand lower pricing or special packaging or impose other requirements on product suppliers these business demands may relate to inventory practices logistics or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship if the company ceases doing business with a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease due to customer inventory reductions or otherwise the company’s business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

profitability could suffer if the company is unable to generate anticipated cost savings and efficiencies or efficiently manage supply chain and manufacturing processes 

the company continues to implement plans to improve its competitive position by setting aggressive annual costsavings targets and it expects ongoing cost savings from its continuous improvement activities the company anticipates these continuing cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing inefficiencies and realizing productivity gains distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of its business segments and corporate if the company cannot successfully implement its costsavings plans or the cost of making these changes increases the company may not realize all anticipated benefits which could adversely affect the company’s financial results these plans could also have a negative impact on the company’s relationships with employees or customers which could also adversely affect the company’s financial results 

  

the company’s success and profitability also depend on the efficient manufacture and production of products historically the company has undertaken restructuring programs and incurred restructuring charges and expects to continue to restructure its operations as necessary to improve operational efficiency gaining additional efficiencies may become increasingly difficult over time and any failure to successfully execute such changes or any increase in the cost of these changes may result in supply chain interruption which may negatively impact product volume and margins 

  

  

government regulations could impose material costs 

generally the manufacture packaging labeling storage distribution and advertising of the company’s products and the conduct of its business operations must all comply with extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations for example in the united states many of the company’s products are regulated by the environmental protection agency the food and drug administration and the consumer product safety commission and the company’s product claims and advertising are regulated by the federal trade commission 

most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies in addition the company’s international operations are subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products if the company is found to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas it could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations particularly with respect to its charcoal business could delay or prevent the company from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results it is possible that the federal government will increase regulation of the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment including as a result of evolving climate change standards or increased regulation in other areas and that such regulation could negatively impact the company’s ability to obtain raw materials or could increase costs in addition pending legislative initiatives and adopted legislation in the areas of healthcare reform and other areas such as the patient protection and affordable care act the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and legislation in the area of taxation of domestic and foreign profits executive compensation and corporate governance could also increase the companys costs these risks may be increased by the company’s acquisitions of healthlink and aplicare inc which manufacture products subject to additional regulations 

the company’s ability to conduct business particularly in international markets may be affected by political legal tax and regulatory risks and government reviews inquiries or investigations could harm the company’s business 

the company’s operations outside the united states are subject to risks relating to noncompliance with legal and regulatory requirements in the united states and in such foreign jurisdictions additionally there is a risk of potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and related difficulties in maintaining effective internal controls from time to time the company conducts internal investigations and compliance reviews to ensure that it is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations additionally the company could be subject to inquiries or investigations by government and other regulatory bodies any determination that the company’s operations or activities are not in compliance with us laws including the foreign corrupt practices act or international laws and regulations could expose the company to significant fines penalties or other sanctions that may harm the business and reputation of the company 

product liability claims and other legal proceedings could adversely affect the company’s sales and operating results 

the company has in the past paid and may be required in the future to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products such claims may be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants or provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use or damage property or persons product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation sales and operating results in addition if one of the company’s products is found to be defective the company could be required to recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims are subject to a retention may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policies 

in addition the company is and may in the future become a party to litigation and other disputes including in foreign jurisdictions in general claims made by or against the company in litigation disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and timeconsuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements injunctions or damages that could significantly affect its business or financial results or condition it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation disputes or proceedings with which the company currently is or may in the future become involved the impact of these matters on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition could be material see “contingencies” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on page 15 and note 12 – other contingencies and guarantees of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 46 of exhibit 991 hereto for additional information related to one of these matters 

the company’s financial results could suffer if the company is unable to implement its strategies or if the company’s strategies do not achieve the intended effects 

the company may not be able to implement its strategies including among other things new product innovation cost savings and penetration of and growth in international markets if the company is unable to implement its strategies in accordance with its expectations the company may not achieve its growth targets and its financial results could be adversely affected there is a risk that implementation of the company’s strategies will not advance the company’s business and financial results 

the company may not successfully develop and introduce new products and line extensions which could adversely impact its financial results 

the company’s future performance and growth depends on its innovation and ability to successfully develop or license and introduce new products line extensions and product improvements the company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve its innovation goals the development and introduction of new products require substantial and effective research development and marketing expenditures which the company may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance new product development and marketing efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays which could result in the company not being first to market and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance if product introductions are not successful costs could be adversely affected in addition if sales generated by new products cause a decline in sales of our existing products our financial results could be materially adversely affected 

acquisitions new venture investments and divestitures may not be successful which could impact the company’s results 

in connection with the company’s strategy the company expects to continue to seek to increase growth through acquisitions not only is it difficult to identify good acquisition candidates and to compete successfully for such candidates but these transactions also involve numerous risks including risks relating to the company’s ability to 

successfully integrate acquired companies products systems or personnel into the company’s existing business especially with respect to businesses or operations that are outside of the united states minimize any potential interruption to the ongoing business of the company or the acquired company successfully enter categories and markets in which the company may have limited or no prior experience achieve expected synergies and obtain the desired financial or strategic benefits from acquisitions retain key relationships with employees customers partners and suppliers of acquired companies and maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies throughout acquired companies acquired companies or operations or newly created ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments future acquisitions or ventures could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt the assumption of contingent liabilities including litigation an increase in expenses related to certain assets and increased operating expenses all of which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would increase among other things the company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risks in addition to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the company’s acquisitions diminish in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill intangible assets or other assets associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect its operating results 

the company may also divest certain assets businesses or brands that do not meet the company’s strategic objectives or growth targets with respect to any divestiture the company may encounter difficulty finding potential acquirers or other divestiture options on favorable terms any divestiture could affect the profitability of the company as a result of the gains or losses on such sale of a business or brand the loss of the operating income resulting from such sale or the costs or liabilities that are not assumed by the acquirer ie stranded costs that may negatively impact profitability subsequent to any divestiture the company may also be required to recognize impairment charges as a result of a divesture 

any potential future acquisitions new ventures or divestitures may divert the attention of management and may divert resources from matters that are core or critical to the business 

reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in disruptions to the company’s business 

the company relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain commodities and raw material inputs including solesource and singlesource suppliers for certain of its raw materials packaging product components finished products and other necessary supplies new suppliers may have to be qualified under governmental industry and company standards which can require additional investment and time if the company is unable to qualify any needed new suppliers or maintain supplier arrangements and relationships if it is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity quality and price levels needed for its business or if any of the company’s key suppliers becomes insolvent or experiences other financial distress the company could experience disruptions in production and its financial results could be adversely affected 

loss of or inability to attract key personnel could adversely impact the company’s business 

the company’s success depends in part on its ability to retain its key personnel including its executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of one or more of the company’s key employees could disrupt its business the company’s success also depends in part on its continuing ability to identify hire train and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense especially in the san francisco bay area where the company’s headquarters and largest research facility are located the company may not be able to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future and its failure to do so could adversely affect its business 

harm to the company’s reputation or the reputation of one or more of its leading brands could have an adverse effect on the business 

maintaining a strong reputation with consumers customers and trade partners is critical to the success of the company’s business the company devotes significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve the company’s reputation and the reputation of its brands these programs include ethics and compliance sustainability and product safety and quality initiatives despite these efforts negative publicity about the company including product safety or similar concerns whether real or perceived could occur and the company’s products could face withdrawal recall or other quality issues negative publicity posts or comments about the company could also be widely disseminated through the use of social media such events if they were to occur could harm the company’s image and result in an adverse effect on its business as well as require resources to rebuild its reputation 

environmental matters create potential liability risks 

the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to air emissions water discharges the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances and concerns regarding climate change the company has incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations and such expenditures reduce the cash flow available to the company for other purposes 

the company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its currently and formerly owned and leased facilities in addition some of its present and former facilities have been or had been in operation for many years and over that time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that those sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom the company has sent waste may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation it is possible that the company could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 

the company had a recorded liability of 13 million and 14 million as of june 30 2013 and 2012 respectively for its share of aggregate future remediation costs related to certain environmental matters including response actions at various locations one matter in dickinson county michigan for which the company is jointly and severally liable accounts for a substantial majority of the recorded liability as of both june 30 2013 and 2012 the company has agreed to be liable for 243 of the aggregate remediation and associated costs for this matter pursuant to a costsharing arrangement with a third party with the assistance of environmental consultants the company maintains an undiscounted liability representing its current best estimate of its share of the capital expenditures maintenance and other costs that may be incurred over an estimated 30year remediation period currently the company cannot accurately predict the timing of future payments that may be made under this obligation in addition the company’s estimated loss exposure is sensitive to a variety of uncertain factors including the efficacy of remediation efforts changes in remediation requirements and the future availability of alternative cleanup technologies although it is reasonably possible that the company’s exposure may exceed the amount recorded any amount of such additional exposures or range of exposures is not estimable at this time 

the company also handles andor transports hazardous substances including but not limited to chlorine at some of its international plant sites a release of such chemicals whether in transit or at the company’s facilities due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability 

the facilities of the company and its suppliers are subject to disruption by events beyond the company’s control 

operations at the facilities of the company and its suppliers and retail customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages demonstrations disease outbreaks or pandemics acts of war terrorism fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters the company’s corporate headquarters and new facility in pleasanton calif are located near major earthquake fault lines in california if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment temporary loss of access to critical data delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations any such disruption could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business 

failure to maximize successfully assert or successfully defend the company’s intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness 

the company relies on intellectual property rights based on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its brands and its products and the packaging for those products the company cannot be certain that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions the company cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be invalidated circumvented or challenged and the company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert its intellectual property rights or to defend those rights from assertions of invalidity in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if other parties infringe the company’s intellectual property rights they may dilute the value of the company’s brands in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the company’s brands and harm its sales the failure to perfect or successfully assert its intellectual property rights could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

if the company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others its competitiveness could be negatively impacted 

if the company is found to have violated the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of thirdparty ideas or technologies such a finding could result in the need to cease use of a trademark trade secret copyrighted work or patented invention in the company’s business and the obligation to pay a substantial amount for past infringement it could also be necessary to pay a substantial amount in the future for rights if holders are willing to permit the company to continue to use such intellectual property rights either having to cease use or pay such amounts could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on its business operating results and financial condition 

  

the company’s substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its operations and financial results and prevent the company from fulfilling its obligations and the company may incur substantially more debt in the future which could exacerbate these risks 

  

the company has a significant amount of indebtedness as of june 30 2013 the company had 24 billion of debt the company’s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

make it more difficult for the company to satisfy its cash obligations limit the company’s ability to fund potential acquisitions require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness which would reduce the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital requirements capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes limit the company’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to general adverse economic conditions or changes in its business and the industry in which it operates place the company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt and limit along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the company’s indebtedness among other things its ability to borrow additional funds failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could have a significant adverse effect on the company in addition the company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions to repurchase shares or to fund other activities for general business purposes subject to compliance with the company’s existing restrictive debt covenants as of june 30 2013 the company could add approximately 17 billion in incremental debt and remain in compliance with restrictive debt covenants although there is no assurance that the actual amount that the company may be able to borrow in the future will equal this amount if new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that the company now faces could intensify in addition the cost of incurring additional debt could increase due to possible downgrades in the company’s credit rating any decision regarding the company’s future borrowings will be based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time including the company’s credit rating if the company were to borrow the maximum amount available to it its credit rating could be downgraded 

  

the company could be adversely affected if its credit ratings were to fall below investment grade 

  

certain terms of the agreements governing the company’s overthecounter derivative instruments contain provisions that require the company’s credit ratings as assigned by standard  poor’s and moody’s to the company and its counterparties to remain at a level equal to or better than the minimum of an investment grade credit rating as of june 30 2013 the company and each of its counterparties had been assigned investmentgrade ratings with both standard  poor’s and moody’s however if the company’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade the counterparties to the derivative instruments in net liability positions could request full collateralization 

  

the company may not have sufficient cash to service its indebtedness and pay cash dividends 

  

the company’s ability to repay and refinance its indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures depends on the company’s cash flow in addition the company’s ability to pay cash dividends depends on cash flow and net earnings as defined by delaware law the company’s cash flow and net earnings are subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond the company’s control and such factors may limit the company’s ability to repay indebtedness declare and pay cash dividends and repatriate foreign earnings at an effective cost 

  

the company’s continued growth and expansion and reliance on thirdparty service providers could adversely affect its internal control over financial reporting which could harm its business and financial results 

  

clorox management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the company’s financial statements would be prevented or detected the company’s continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets will place significant additional pressure on the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting moreover the company engages the services of third parties to assist with business operations and financial reporting processes which inserts additional monitoring obligations and risk into the system of internal control any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the company’s ability to report its financial results accurately and on a timely basis or to detect and prevent fraud 

  

  

a failure of key information technology systems could adversely impact the company’s ability to conduct business 

the company relies extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers in order to conduct its business these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to communicating within the company and with other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping products to customers processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements and other processes involved in managing the business the company has made significant progress with its implementation of enterprisewide upgrades to its hardware software and operating systems including its erp system in latin america which replaces legacy systems and is expected to streamline operations and enable future growth if the company’s existing andor future technology systems and processes do not adequately support the future growth of the company’s business the company’s business may be adversely impacted although the company has network security measures in place the systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses security breaches and other similar disruptions from unauthorized users while the company has business continuity plans in place if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes including catastrophic events power outages security breaches or other similar events and if the business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in the ability to manage or conduct business which may adversely impact the company’s business furthermore if the company suffers a loss as a result of a breach or other breakdown in its technology system or such a breach or other breakdown results in disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information the company may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm which may adversely affect the company’s results of operations andor financial condition 

the company’s judgments regarding the accounting for tax positions and the resolution of tax disputes may impact the company’s earnings and cash flow 

significant judgment is required in determining the company’s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions the company provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement criteria prescribed by applicable accounting standards fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties may impact the company’s effective tax rate and the company’s financial results when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate which would have an adverse effect on our operating results any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution for additional information refer to the information set forth in note 18  income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 53 of exhibit 991 hereto 

the estimates and assumptions on which the company’s financial statement projections are based may prove to be inaccurate which may cause its actual results to materially differ from such projections which may adversely affect the company’s stock price 

the company’s financial statement projections are dependent on certain estimates and assumptions related to among other things category growth commodity prices cost savings foreign exchange rates accruals for estimated liabilities including litigation reserves goodwill market share projections measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans and the company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in its existing business fund internal growth repurchase its shares make acquisitions pay dividends and meet debt obligations while the company’s projections are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made the company’s actual results may differ materially from its financial outlook any material variation between the company’s projections and its actual results may adversely affect its stock price 

there can be no guarantee that the company will continue to declare dividends or repurchase its stock 

although the company has historically declared quarterly cash dividends on its common stock and has been authorized to repurchase its shares subject to certain limitations under a share repurchase program any determinations to continue to declare cash dividends on its common stock or to repurchase its common stock will be based primarily upon the company’s financial condition results of operations and business requirements the price of its common stock in the case of the repurchase program and the board of directors’ continuing determination that the repurchase program and the declaration of dividends are in the best interests of the company’s stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs in the event the company does not declare a quarterly dividend or discontinues its share repurchases the company’s stock price could be adversely affected

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties set forth below as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report or in other filings by the company with the sec could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the company or that are not currently believed by the company to be material may also harm the company’s business operations and financial results 

unfavorable worldwide regional and local economic conditions and financial market volatility may negatively impact the company’s financial performance and liquidity 

although the company continues to devote significant resources to support its brands unfavorable economic conditions may continue to negatively affect consumer demand for the company’s products consumers may reduce discretionary spending due to economic uncertainty or unfavorable economic conditions and this may lead to reduced sales volumes or cause a shift in the company’s product mix from higher margin to lower margin products consumers may increase purchases of lowerpriced or nonbranded products and the company’s competitors may increase levels of promotional activity for lowerpriced products as they seek to maintain sales volumes during uncertain economic times 

in addition global markets have continued to experience significant disruptions during fiscal year 2012 and continuing volatility particularly in venezuela and argentina could harm the company’s business although the company currently generates significant cash flows from ongoing operations and has access to global credit markets through its financing activities and existing credit facilities to meet its current needs if the current credit conditions were to worsen the company might not be able to access credit markets on favorable terms when needed which could adversely affect the company’s ability to borrow financial market volatility and unfavorable economic conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of the company’s customers suppliers and other business partners if customers’ financial conditions are severely affected the company may not be able to collect accounts receivable which could impact its results 

the company faces intense competition in its markets which could lead to reduced profitability 

the company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the united states and in its international markets most of the company’s products compete with other widelyadvertised brands within each product category and with “private label” brands and “generic” nonbranded products of grocery chains and wholesale cooperatives in certain categories which typically are sold at lower prices 

the company’s products generally compete on the basis of product performance brand recognition price value or other benefits to consumers advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on consumer purchasing decisions and the company is increasingly using digital media marketing and promotional programs to reach consumers a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position if the company’s advertising marketing and promotional programs including its use of digital media to reach consumers are not effective or adequate the company’s sales and volume may be impacted 

some of the company’s competitors are larger than the company and have greater financial resources these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the company can in addition the company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the company competitive activity may require the company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions andor reduce prices which could lead to reduced profits and adversely affect growth 

sales growth objectives may be difficult to achieve and price increases market category declines and changes to the company’s product and geographic mix may impact the company’s financial results 

a large percentage of the company’s revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition during fiscal year 2012 approximately 79 of the company’s net sales was generated in us markets us markets for cleaning products are generally characterized by high household penetration the company’s ability to achieve sales growth will depend on its ability to drive growth through innovation investment in its established brands and enhanced merchandising and its ability to capture market share from competitors the company anticipates taking some price increases across its global portfolio in fiscal year 2013 which may slow sales growth or create volume declines in the short term as consumers adjust to price increases if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product improvements undertake sales marketing and advertising initiatives that grow its product categories and develop acquire or successfully launch new products it may not achieve its sales growth objectives even if the company is successful in increasing sales within its product categories a continuing or accelerating decline in the overall markets for its products could have a negative impact on the company’s financial results 

in addition changes to the mix of products the company sells as well as the mix of countries in which its products are sold can adversely impact the company’s operating expenses the amount of revenue and the timing of revenue recognition which could cause its profitability to suffer the company’s outlook assumes a certain volume and product mix of sales and if actual results vary from this projected volume and product mix of sales the company’s operations and results could be negatively affected 

volatility and increases in the price of raw materials energy shipping and transportation and other necessary supplies or services could harm the company’s profits 

volatility and increases in the price of raw materials including resin chloralkali sodium hypochlorite highstrength bleach linerboard soybean oil solvent natural oils corrugate and other chemicals and agricultural commodities or increases in the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services may harm the company’s profits and operating results the company anticipates continued commodity and other price increases in fiscal year 2013 and if such increases occur or exceed the company’s estimates and the company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset such price increases its profits and operating results will be harmed in addition if the company increases the prices of its products in response to increases in the cost of commodities and the commodity costs decline the company may not be able to sustain its price increases over time also competitors may not adjust their prices or customers may decide not to pay the higher prices which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume and while the company seeks to project tradeoffs between price increases and volume its projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations for further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on page 18 of exhibit 991 hereto 

to reduce the price volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases the company uses derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps the extent of the company’s derivative position at any given time depends on the company’s assessment of the markets for these commodities the price volatility in the markets and the cost of the derivative instruments many of the commodities used by the company in its products do not have actively traded derivative instruments if the company does not or is unable to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if it institutes a position and costs subsequently decrease the company’s costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than its competitors’ costs and financial results could be adversely affected 

profitability could suffer if the company is unable to generate anticipated cost savings and efficiencies or efficiently manage supply chain and manufacturing processes 

the company continues to implement plans to improve its competitive position by achieving aggressive annual costsavings targets and it expects ongoing cost savings from its continuous improvement activities the company anticipates these continuing cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing inefficiencies and realizing productivity gains distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of its business segments if the company cannot successfully implement its costsavings plans or the cost of making these costsavings changes increases it may not realize all anticipated benefits any negative impact these plans have on the company’s relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect its financial results 

the company’s success and profitability also depend on the efficient manufacture and production of products historically the company has undertaken restructuring programs and incurred restructuring charges and expects to continue to restructure its operations as necessary to improve operational efficiency gaining additional efficiencies may become increasingly difficult over time and any failure to successfully execute such changes or any increase in the cost of these changes may result in supply chain interruption which may negatively impact product volume and margins 

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations including exposure to foreign exchange rate risk 

the company faces and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations including 

economic or political instability in its international markets particularly in venezuela and argentina difficulty in obtaining nonlocal currency eg us dollars to pay for the raw materials needed to manufacture the company’s products and contractmanufactured products particularly in venezuela and argentina restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the united states including possible taxes or withholding obligations on any repatriations and the imposition of tariffs trade restrictions price controls or other governmental actions generating a negative impact on its business particularly in venezuela and argentina these risks could have a significant impact on the company’s ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position the company’s small sales volume in some countries relative to some multinational and local competitors could exacerbate such risks 

in addition the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar although the company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks these hedges only offset a small portion of the company’s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and its reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 

the company’s international operations are also subject to risks relating to potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations import and export laws raw material availability credit risk of local customers suppliers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences 

inflation is another risk associated with the company’s international operations for example venezuela has been designated for financial reporting purposes as a highly inflationary economy and argentina could in the future be designated as such gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of nonus dollar monetary assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in net earnings venezuela’s designation as a highly inflationary economy and the potential for further devaluation of the local currency exchange rate will continue to negatively affect the company’s revenue operating profit and net income in fiscal year 2013 and beyond in addition there can be no assurance that other countries in which the company operates will not also become highly inflationary that such countries’ currencies will not be devalued or both and that the company’s operations will not be negatively impacted as a result for further information regarding venezuela see “venezuela” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on page 11 of exhibit 991 hereto 

government regulations could impose material costs 

generally the manufacture packaging labeling storage distribution and advertising of the company’s products and the conduct of its business operations must all comply with extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations for example in the united states many of the company’s products are regulated by the environmental protection agency the food and drug administration and the consumer product safety commission and the company’s product claims and advertising are regulated by the federal trade commission 

most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies in addition the company’s international operations are subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products if the company is found to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas it could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations particularly with respect to its charcoal business could delay or prevent the company from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results it is possible that the federal government will increase regulation of the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment including as a result of evolving climate change standards or increased regulation in other areas and that such regulation could negatively impact the company’s ability to obtain raw materials or could increase costs in addition pending legislative initiatives and adopted legislation such as the patient protection and affordable care act the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act in the areas of healthcare reform and other initiatives and legislation in the area of taxation of domestic and foreign profits executive compensation and corporate governance could also increase the companys costs these risks may be increased by the company’s recent acquisitions of healthlink and aplicare inc which manufacture products subject to additional regulations 

the company’s ability to conduct business particularly in international markets may be affected by political legal tax and regulatory risks and government reviews inquiries or investigations could harm the company’s business 

the company’s operations outside the united states are subject to risks relating to noncompliance with legal and regulatory requirements in the united states and in such foreign jurisdictions additionally there is a risk of potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and related difficulties in maintaining effective internal controls from time to time the company may conduct internal investigations and compliance reviews to ensure that it is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations additionally the company could be subject to inquiries or investigations by government and other regulatory bodies any determination that the company’s operations or activities are not in compliance with us laws including the foreign corrupt practices act or international laws and regulations could expose the company to significant fines penalties or other sanctions that may harm the business and reputation of the company 

acquisitions new venture investments and divestitures may not be successful which could impact the company’s results 

in connection with the company’s strategy the company expects to seek to increase growth through acquisitions not only is the identification of good acquisition candidates difficult and competitive but these transactions also involve numerous risks including the ability to 

successfully integrate acquired companies products systems or personnel into the company’s existing business especially with respect to businesses or operations that are outside of the united states minimize any potential interruption to the ongoing business of the company or the acquired company successfully enter categories and markets in which the company may have limited or no prior experience achieve expected synergies and obtain the desired financial or strategic benefits from acquisitions retain key relationships with employees customers partners and suppliers of acquired companies and maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies throughout acquired companies acquired companies or operations or newlycreated ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made future acquisitions or ventures could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt the assumption of contingent liabilities including litigation the increase in expenses related to certain assets and increased operating expenses all of which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would increase among other things the company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risks in addition to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the company’s acquisitions diminish in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill intangible assets or other assets associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect its operating results 

the company may also divest certain assets businesses or brands that do not meet the company’s strategic objectives or growth targets with respect to any divestiture the company may encounter difficulty finding potential acquirers or other divestiture options on favorable terms any divestiture could affect the profitability of the company either as a result of the gains or losses on such sale of a business or brand the loss of the operating income resulting from such sale or the costs or liabilities that are not assumed by the acquirer ie stranded costs that may negatively impact profitability subsequent to any divestiture the company may also be required to recognize impairment charges as a result of a divesture 

any potential future acquisitions new ventures or divestitures may divert the attention of management and may divert resources from matters that are core or critical to the business 

the company may not successfully develop and introduce new products and line extensions 

the company’s future performance and growth depends on its innovation and ability to successfully develop or license and introduce new products and line extensions and product improvements the company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve its innovation goals the development and introduction of new products require substantial and effective research development and marketing expenditures which the company may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance new product development and marketing efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays which could result in the company not being first to market the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance and the cost of failed product introductions 

dependence on key customers could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the company’s net sales net sales to the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates were 26 27 and 27 for the fiscal years ended 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively of consolidated net sales and occurred in each of the company’s reportable segments no other customers exceeded 10 of consolidated net sales in any of these fiscal years during fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 the company’s five largest customers accounted for 44 44 and 45 of its net sales respectively and its ten largest customers accounted for 55 of its net sales for each of these fiscal years the company expects that a significant portion of its revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers as a result changes in the strategies of the company’s largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to “private label” or competitors’ products may harm the company’s sales additionally this may reduce the ability of the company to bring new innovative products to consumers 

in addition the company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders and the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its customers accordingly these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the company at any time and for any reason if the company does not effectively respond to the demands of its customers they could decrease their purchases from the company causing the company’s sales and profits to decline in recent years the company has seen increasing retailer consolidation both in the united states and internationally this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailers which may demand lower pricing or special packaging or impose other requirements on product suppliers these business demands may relate to inventory practices logistics or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship if the company ceases doing business with a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease due to customer inventory reductions or otherwise the company’s business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in disruptions to the company’s business 

the company relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain commodities and raw material inputs including solesource and singlesource suppliers for certain of its raw materials packaging product components finished products and other necessary supplies if the company is unable to maintain supplier arrangements and relationships or if it is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity quality and price levels needed for its business or if any of the company’s key suppliers becomes insolvent or experiences other financial distress the company could experience disruptions in production and its financial results could be adversely affected 

the company’s financial results could suffer if the company is unable to implement its strategies or if the company’s strategies do not achieve the intended effects 

the company may not be able to implement its strategies including among other things new product innovation cost savings and penetration of and growth in international markets if the company is unable to implement its strategies in accordance with its expectations the company may not achieve its intended growth targets and its financial results could be adversely affected while the company believes that implementation of its strategies will advance the company’s business and financial results there can be no assurance that this will be the case 

the company’s success depends in part on its key personnel 

the company’s success depends in part on its ability to retain its key personnel including its executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of one or more of the company’s key employees could disrupt its business the company’s success also depends in part on its continuing ability to identify hire train and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense especially in the san francisco bay area where the company’s headquarters and largest research facility are located the company may not be able to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future and its failure to do so could adversely affect its business 

product liability claims and other legal proceedings could adversely affect the company’s sales and operating results 

the company has in the past paid and may be required in the future to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products such claims may be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances or damage property or persons product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s reputation sales and operating results in addition if one of the company’s products is found to be defective the company could be required to recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains general and product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of such insurance coverage or certain product liability claims may be excluded under the terms of the policies 

in addition the company is and may in the future become a party to litigation and other disputes in general claims made by or against the company in litigation disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements injunctions or damages that could significantly affect its business or financial results or condition it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation disputes or proceedings with which the company currently is or may in the future become involved the impact of these matters on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition could be material see “contingencies” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on page 17 and note 12 – other contingencies and guarantees of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 47 of exhibit 991 hereto for additional information related to one of these matters 

harm to the company’s reputation or the reputation of one or more of its leading brands could have an adverse effect on the business 

maintaining a strong reputation with consumers customers and trade partners is critical to the success of the company’s business the company devotes significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve the company’s reputation and the reputation of its brands these programs include ethics and compliance sustainability and product safety and quality initiatives despite these efforts negative publicity about the company including product safety or similar concerns whether real or perceived could occur and the company’s products could face withdrawal recall or other quality issues such events if they were to occur could harm the company’s image and result in an adverse effect on its business as well as require resources to rebuild its reputation 

environmental matters create potential liability risks 

the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to air emissions water discharges the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances and concerns regarding climate change the company has incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations and such expenditures reduce the cash flow available to the company for other purposes 

the company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its currently and formerly owned and leased facilities in addition some of its present and former facilities have been or had been in operation for many years and over that time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that those sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom the company has sent waste may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation it is possible that the company could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 

the company had a recorded liability of 14 million and 15 million at june 30 2012 and 2011 respectively for its share of aggregate future remediation costs related to certain environmental matters including response actions at various locations one matter in dickinson county michigan for which the company is jointly and severally liable accounts for a substantial majority of the recorded liability at both june 30 2012 and 2011 the company has agreed to be liable for 243 of the aggregate remediation and associated costs for this matter pursuant to a costsharing arrangement with a third party with the assistance of environmental consultants the company maintains an undiscounted liability representing its current best estimate of its share of the capital expenditures maintenance and other costs that may be incurred over an estimated 30year remediation period currently the company cannot accurately predict the timing of future payments that may be made under this obligation in addition the company’s estimated loss exposure is sensitive to a variety of uncertain factors including the efficacy of remediation efforts changes in remediation requirements and the future availability of alternative cleanup technologies although it is possible that the company’s exposure may exceed the amount recorded any amount of such additional exposures or range of exposures is not estimable at this time 

the company also handles andor transports hazardous substances including but not limited to chlorine at some of its international plant sites a release of such chemicals whether in transit or at the company’s facilities due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability 

failure to maximize successfully assert or successfully defend the company’s intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness 

the company relies on intellectual property rights based on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its brands and its products and the packaging for those products the company cannot be certain that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions the company cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be invalidated circumvented or challenged and the company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert its intellectual property rights or to defend those rights from assertions of invalidity in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if other parties infringe the company’s intellectual property rights they may dilute the value of the company’s brands in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the company’s brands and harm its sales the failure to perfect or successfully assert its intellectual property rights could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

if the company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others its competitiveness could be negatively impacted 

one of the company’s strategies is to improve its products by licensing thirdparty ideas and technologies in a process referred to as “open innovation” if the company is found to have violated the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of such thirdparty ideas or technologies arising from its open innovation projects such a finding could result in the need to cease use of a trademark trade secret copyrighted work or patented invention in the company’s business and the obligation to pay a substantial amount for past infringement it could also be necessary to pay a substantial amount in the future for rights if holders are willing to permit the company to continue to use such intellectual property rights either having to cease use or pay such amounts could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company’s substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its operations and financial results and prevent the company from fulfilling its obligations and the company may incur substantially more debt in the future which could exacerbate these risks 

the company has a significant amount of indebtedness as of june 30 2012 the company had 27 billion of debt including 850 million of senior unsecured notes that mature in fiscal year 2013 the company’s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

make it more difficult for the company to satisfy its cash obligations limit the company’s ability to fund potential acquisitions require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness which would reduce the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital requirements capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes limit the company’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to general adverse economic conditions or changes in its business and the industry in which it operates place the company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt and limit along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the company’s indebtedness among other things its ability to borrow additional funds failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could have a significant adverse effect on the company in addition the company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions to repurchase shares or to fund other activities for general business purposes subject to compliance with the company’s existing restrictive debt covenants as of june 30 2012 the company could add approximately 11 billion in incremental debt and remain in compliance with restrictive debt covenants although there is no assurance that the actual amount that the company may be able to borrow in the future will equal this amount if new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that the company now faces could intensify in addition the cost of incurring additional debt could increase due to possible downgrades in the company’s credit rating any decision regarding the company’s future borrowings will be based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time including the company’s credit rating if the company were to borrow the maximum amount available to it its credit rating could be downgraded 

the company could be adversely affected if its credit ratings were to fall below investment grade 

certain terms of the agreements governing the company’s overthecounter derivative instruments contain provisions that require the company’s credit ratings as assigned by standard  poor’s and moody’s to the company and its counterparties to remain at a level equal to or better than the minimum of an investment grade credit rating if the company’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade the counterparties to the derivative instruments in net liability positions could request full collateralization as of june 30 2012 the company and each of its counterparties maintained investmentgrade ratings with both standard  poor’s and moody’s 

the company may not have sufficient cash to service its indebtedness and pay cash dividends 

the company’s ability to repay and refinance its indebtedness particularly the 850 million of senior unsecured notes that mature in fiscal year 2013 and to fund capital expenditures depends on the company’s cash flow in addition the company’s ability to pay cash dividends depends on cash flow and net earnings as defined by delaware law the company’s cash flow and net earnings are often subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond the company’s control and such factors may limit the company’s ability to repay indebtedness declare and pay cash dividends and repatriate foreign earnings at an effective cost 

the facilities of the company and its suppliers are subject to disruption by events beyond the company’s control 

operations at the facilities of the company and its suppliers and retail customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages demonstrations disease outbreaks or pandemics acts of war terrorism fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters the company’s corporate headquarters technical and data center and new facility in pleasanton calif are located near major earthquake fault lines in california if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment temporary loss of access to critical data delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations 

the company’s continued growth and expansion and increasing reliance on thirdparty service providers could adversely affect its internal control over financial reporting which could harm its business and financial results 

clorox management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the company’s financial statements would be prevented or detected the company’s continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets will place significant additional pressure on the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting moreover the company increasingly engages the services of third parties to assist with business operations and financial reporting processes which inserts additional monitoring obligations and risk into the system of internal control any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the company’s ability to report its financial results accurately and on a timely basis or to detect and prevent fraud 

a failure of key information technology systems could adversely impact the company’s ability to conduct business 

the company relies extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers in order to conduct its business these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to communicating within the company and with other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping products to customers processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements and other processes involved in managing the business the company has made significant progress with its implementation of enterprisewide upgrades to its hardware software and operating systems including its erp system in latin america which replaces legacy systems and is expected to streamline operations and enable future growth if the company’s existing andor future technology systems and processes do not adequately support the future growth of the company’s business the company’s business may be adversely impacted although the company has network security measures in place the systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses security breaches and other similar disruptions from unauthorized users while the company has business continuity plans in place if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes including catastrophic events power outages security breaches or other similar events and if the business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in the ability to manage or conduct business which may adversely impact the company’s business 

the company’s judgments regarding the accounting for tax positions and the resolution of tax disputes may impact the company’s earnings and cash flow 

significant judgment is required in determining the company’s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions the company provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement criteria prescribed by applicable accounting standards fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties may impact the company’s effective tax rate and the company’s financial results when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution for additional information refer to the information set forth in note 18  income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 55 of exhibit 991 hereto 

the estimates and assumptions on which the company’s financial statement projections are based may prove to be inaccurate which may cause its actual results to materially differ from such projections which may adversely affect the company’s stock price 

the company’s financial statement projections are dependent on certain estimates and assumptions related to among other things category growth commodity prices cost savings foreign exchange rates liabilities goodwill market share projections and the company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in its existing business fund internal growth repurchase its shares make acquisitions pay dividends and meet debt obligations while the company’s projections are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made the company’s actual results may differ materially from its financial outlook any material variation between the company’s projections and its actual results may adversely affect its stock price 

there can be no guarantee that the company will continue to declare dividends or repurchase its stock 

although the company has historically declared quarterly cash dividends on its common stock and has been authorized to repurchase its shares subject to certain limitations under a share repurchase program any determinations to continue to declare cash dividends on its common stock or to repurchase its common stock will be based primarily upon the company’s financial condition results of operations and business requirements the price of its common stock in the case of the repurchase program and the board of directors’ continuing determination that the repurchase program and the declaration of dividends are in the best interests of the company’s stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs in the event the company does not declare a quarterly dividend or discontinues its share repurchases the company’s stock price could be adversely affected 

the company’s business could be negatively affected as a result of an unsolicited takeover proposal or a proxy contest 

during fiscal years 2012 and 2011 the company was the target of an unsolicited takeover proposal from a shareholder activist which resulted in significant costs to the company if such a proposal were to be made again the company would incur significant costs which would have an adverse effect on the company’s financial results in addition such a proposal may disrupt the company’s operations and divert the attention of the company’s management and employees in addition any perceived uncertainties as to the company’s future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners which could adversely affect the company’s business

 item 1a risk factors 

 

the risks and uncertainties set forth below as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report or in other filings by the company with the sec could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the company or that are not currently believed by the company to be material may also harm the company’s business operations and financial results 

 

the company faces intense competition in its markets which could lead to reduced profitability 

 

the company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the united states and in its international markets most of the company’s products compete with other widelyadvertised brands within each product category and with “private label” brands and “generic” nonbranded products of grocery chains and wholesale cooperatives in certain categories which typically are sold at lower prices 

 

the company’s products generally compete on the basis of product performance brand recognition price value or other benefits to consumers advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on consumer purchasing decisions and the company is increasingly using digital media marketing and promotional programs to reach consumers a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position if the company’s advertising marketing and promotional programs including its use of digital media to reach consumers are not effective or adequate the company’s sales and volume may be impacted 

 

some of the company’s competitors are larger and have financial resources greater than those of the company these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the company can in addition the company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the company competitive activity may require the company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions andor reduce prices which could lead to reduced profits and adversely affect growth 

 

unfavorable worldwide  regional and local economic conditions and financial market volatility may negatively impact the company’s financial performance and liquidity 

 

although the company continues to devote significant resources to support its brands unfavorable economic conditions may continue to negatively affect consumer demand for the company’s products consumers may reduce discretionary spending due to economic uncertainty or unfavorable economic conditions and this may lead to reduced sales volumes or cause a shift in the company’s product mix from higher margin to lower margin products consumers may increase purchases of lowerpriced or nonbranded products and the company’s competitors may increase levels of promotional activity for lowerpriced products as they seek to maintain sales volumes during uncertain economic times 

 

in addition global markets have continued to experience significant disruptions during fiscal year 2011 and continuing volatility could harm the company’s business although the company currently generates significant cash flows from ongoing operations and has access to global credit markets through its financing activities and existing credit facilities if the current credit conditions were to worsen the company might not be able to access credit markets on favorable terms which could adversely affect the company’s ability to borrow financial market volatility and unfavorable economic conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of the company’s customers suppliers and other business partners if customers’ financial conditions are severely affected the company may not be able to collect accounts receivable which could impact its results 

 

 

 

sales growth objectives may be difficult to achieve and price increases and changes to the company’s product and geographic mix may impact the company’s financial results 

  

a large percentage of the company’s revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition during fiscal year 2011 approximately 79 of the company’s net sales was generated in us markets us markets for cleaning products are generally characterized by high household penetration the company’s ability to achieve sales growth will depend on its ability to drive growth through innovation investment in its established brands and enhanced merchandising and its ability to capture market share from competitors the company anticipates taking broad price increases across its global portfolio in fiscal year 2012 which may slow sales growth or create volume declines in the short term as consumers adjust to price increases if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product improvements undertake sales marketing and advertising initiatives that grow its product categories and develop acquire or successfully launch new products it may not achieve its sales growth objectives 

 

in addition changes to the mix of products the company sells as well as the mix of countries in which its products are sold can adversely impact the company’s operating expenses the amount of revenue and the timing of revenue recognition which could cause its profitability to suffer the company’s outlook assumes a certain volume and product mix of sales and if actual results vary from this projected volume and product mix of sales the company’s operations and results could be negatively affected 

 

volatility and increases in the price of raw materials energy shipping and transportation and other necessary supplies or services could harm the company’s profits 

 

volatility and increases in the price of raw materials including resin chloralkali sodium hypochlorite highstrength bleach linerboard soybean oil solvent natural oils corrugate and other chemicals and agricultural commodities or increases in the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services may harm the company’s profits and operating results the company anticipates significant commodity and other price increases in fiscal year 2012 and if such increases occur or exceed the company’s estimates and the company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset such price increases its profits and operating results will be harmed in addition if the company increases the prices of its products in response to increases in the cost of commodities and the commodity costs decline the company may not be able to sustain its price increases over time also competitors may not adjust their prices which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume and while the company seeks to project tradeoffs between price increases and volume its projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations for further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on page 16 of exhibit 991 hereto 

 

to reduce the price volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases the company uses derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps the extent of the company’s derivative position at any given time depends on the company’s assessment of the markets for these commodities the price volatility in the markets and the cost of the derivative instruments many of the commodities used by the company in its products do not have actively traded derivative instruments if the company does not or is unable to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if it institutes a position and costs subsequently decrease the company’s costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than its competitors’ costs and financial results could be adversely affected 

 

profitability could suffer if the company is unable to generate anticipated cost savings and efficiencies or efficiently manage supply chain and manufacturing processes 

 

the company continues to implement plans to improve its competitive position by achieving aggressive annual costsavings targets and it expects ongoing cost savings from its continuous improvement activities the company anticipates these continuing cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing inefficiencies and realizing productivity gains distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of its business segments if the company cannot successfully implement its costsavings plans or the cost of making these costsavings changes increases it may not realize all anticipated benefits any negative impact these plans have on the company’s relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect its financial results 

 

 

 

the company’s success and profitability also depend on the efficient manufacture and production of products historically the company has undertaken restructuring programs and incurred restructuring charges and expects to continue to restructure its operations as necessary to improve operational efficiency for example beginning in fiscal year 2008 the company began a supply chain restructuring involving closing certain domestic and international manufacturing facilities and redistributing production between the remaining facilities and thirdparty producers to optimize available capacity and reduce operating costs gaining additional efficiencies may become increasingly difficult over time and any failure to successfully execute such changes or any increase in the cost of these changes may result in supply chain interruption which may negatively impact product volume and margins 

 

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations including exposure to foreign exchange rate risk 

 

the company faces and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations including 

economic or political instability in its international markets including in latin america and particularly in venezuela and argentina difficulty in obtaining nonlocal currency eg us dollars to pay for the raw materials needed to manufacture the company’s products and contractmanufactured products particularly in venezuela restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the united states including possible taxes or withholding obligations on any repatriations and the imposition of tariffs trade restrictions price restrictions or other governmental actions generating a negative impact on its business these risks could have a significant impact on the company’s ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position the company’s small sales volume in some countries relative to some multinational and local competitors could exacerbate such risks 

 

in addition the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar although the company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks these hedges only offset a small portion of the company’s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and its reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 

 

the company’s operations outside the united states are also subject to risks relating to potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations import and export laws raw material availability credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences 

 

inflation is another risk associated with the company’s international operations for example venezuela has been designated as a highly inflationary economy gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of nonus dollar monetary assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in earnings given venezuela’s designation as a highly inflationary economy and the devaluation of the official rate the company’s revenue operating profit and net income will continue to be negatively impacted in fiscal year 2012 and beyond in addition there can be no assurance that other countries in which the company operates such as argentina will not also become highly inflationary and that its operations will not be negatively impacted as a result for further information regarding venezuela see “venezuela” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on page 12 of exhibit 991 hereto 

 

government regulations could impose material costs 

 

generally the manufacture packaging labeling storage distribution and advertising of the company’s products and the conduct of its business operations must all comply with extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations for example in the united states many of the company’s products are regulated by the environmental protection agency the food and drug administration and the consumer product safety commission and the company’s product claims and advertising are regulated by the federal trade commission in addition security at certain of the company’s facilities is regulated by the department of homeland security 

 

 

 

most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies in addition the company’s international operations are subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products if the company is found to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas it could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent the company from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results particularly with respect to its charcoal business it is possible that the federal government will increase regulation of the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to enhance homeland security or protect the environment including with evolving climate change standards or increased regulation in other areas and that such regulation could negatively impact the company’s ability to obtain raw materials or could increase costs in addition pending legislative initiatives and newly adopted legislation such as the patient protection and affordable care act the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act in the areas of healthcare reform and other initiatives and legislation in the area of taxation of domestic and foreign profits executive compensation and corporate governance could also increase the companys costs 

 

the company’s ability to conduct business particularly in international markets may be affected by political legal tax and regulatory risks and government reviews inquiries or investigations could harm the company’s business 

 

the company’s operations outside the united states are subject to risks relating to compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in the united states and in local jurisdictions additionally there is a risk of potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls from time to time the company may conduct internal investigations and compliance reviews to ensure that it is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations additionally the company could be subject to inquiries or investigations by government and other regulatory bodies any determination that the company’s operations or activities are not in compliance with us laws including the foreign corrupt practices act or international laws and regulations could expose the company to significant fines penalties or other sanctions that may harm the business and reputation of the company 

 

acquisitions new venture investments and divestitures may not be successful which could impact the company’s results 

 

in connection with the company’s strategy the company may seek to increase growth through acquisitions not only is the identification of good acquisition candidates difficult and competitive but these transactions also involve numerous risks including the ability to 

successfully integrate acquired companies products systems or personnel into the company’s existing business especially with respect to businesses or operations that are outside of the united states minimize any potential interruption to the ongoing business of the company successfully enter categories and markets in which the company may have limited or no prior experience achieve expected synergies and obtain the desired financial or strategic benefits from acquisitions retain key relationships with employees customers partners and suppliers of acquired companies and maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies throughout acquired companies acquired companies or operations or newlycreated ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made future acquisitions or ventures could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt the assumption of contingent liabilities the increase in expenses related to certain assets and increased operating expenses which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would increase among other things the company’s exposure to foreign exchange risks in addition to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the company’s acquisitions diminish in the future the company may be required to record writedowns of goodwill intangible assets or other assets associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect its operating results 

 

 

 

the company may also divest certain assets businesses or brands that do not meet the company’s strategic objectives or growth targets with respect to any divestiture the company may encounter difficulty finding potential acquirers or other divestiture options on favorable terms any divestiture could affect the profitability of the company either as a result of the gains or losses on such sale of a business or brand the loss of the operating income resulting from such sale or the costs or liabilities that are not assumed by the acquirer ie stranded costs that may negatively impact profitability subsequent to any divestiture the company may also be required to recognize impairment charges as the result of a divesture 

 

any potential future acquisitions new ventures or divestitures may divert the attention of management and may divert resources from matters that are core or critical to the business 

 

the company may not successfully develop and introduce new products and line extensions 

 

the company’s future performance and growth depends on its innovation and ability to successfully develop or license and introduce new products and line extensions and product improvements the company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve its innovation goals the development and introduction of new products require substantial and effective research development and marketing expenditures which the company may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance new product development and marketing efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays which could result in the company not being first to market the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance and the cost of failed product introductions 

 

dependence on key customers could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the company’s net sales net sales to the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates were 26 for fiscal year 2011 and 27 for each of   fiscal years 2010 and 2009 of the company’s consolidated net sales and occurred in each of the company’s reportable segments no other customers exceeded 10 of the company’s consolidated net sales in any of these fiscal years during fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 the company’s five largest customers accounted for 44 45 and 44 of its net sales respectively and its ten largest customers accounted for 55 55 and 54 of its net sales respectively the company expects that a significant portion of its revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers as a result changes in the strategies of the company’s largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to “private label” or competitors’ products may harm the company’s sales additionally this may reduce the ability of the company to bring new innovative products to consumers 

 

in addition the company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders and the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its customers accordingly these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the company at any time and for any reason if the company does not effectively respond to the demands of its customers they could decrease their purchases from the company causing the company’s sales and profits to decline in recent years the company has seen increasing retailer consolidation both in the united states and internationally this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailers which may demand lower pricing or special packaging or impose other requirements on product suppliers these business demands may relate to inventory practices logistics or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship if the company ceases doing business with a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease due to customer inventory reductions or otherwise the company’s business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

 

 

 

the company’s financial results could suffer if the company is unable to implement its strategies or if the company’s strategies do not achieve the intended effects 

 

there is no assurance that the company will be able to implement its strategies including among other things new product innovation cost savings and penetration of and growth in international markets if the company is unable to implement its strategies in accordance with its expectations the company may not achieve its intended growth targets and its financial results could be adversely affected while the company believes that implementation of its strategies will advance the company’s business and financial results there can be no assurance that this will be the case 

 

reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in disruption to the company’s business 

 

the company relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain commodities and raw material inputs including solesource and singlesource suppliers for certain of its raw materials packaging product components finished products and other necessary supplies if the company is unable to maintain supplier arrangements and relationships or if it is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity quality and price levels needed for its business or if any of the company’s key suppliers becomes insolvent or experiences other financial distress the company could experience disruptions in production and its financial results could be adversely affected 

 

the company’s success depends in part on its key personnel 

 

the company’s success depends in part on its ability to retain its key personnel including its executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of one or more of the company’s key employees could disrupt its business the company’s success also depends in part on its continuing ability to identify hire train and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense especially in the san francisco bay area where the company’s headquarters and largest research facility are located the company may not be able to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future and its failure to do so could adversely affect its business 

 

product liability claims could adversely affect the company’s sales and operating results 

 

the company has in the past and may be required in the future to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products such claims may be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances or damage property or persons product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s sales and operating results in addition if one of the company’s products is found to be defective the company could be required to recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or certain product liability claims may be excluded under the terms of the policies 

 

harm to the company’s reputation or the reputation of one or more of its leading brands could have an adverse effect on the business 

 

maintaining a strong reputation with consumers customers and trade partners is critical to the success of the company’s business the company devotes significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve the company’s reputation and the reputation of its brands these programs include ethics and compliance sustainability and product safety and quality initiatives despite these efforts adverse publicity about the company including product safety or similar concerns whether real or perceived could occur and the company’s products could face withdrawal recall or other quality issues such events if they were to occur could harm the company’s image and result in an adverse effect on its business as well as require resources to rebuild its reputation 

 

 

 

environmental matters create potential liability risks 

 

the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to air emissions water discharges the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances and concerns regarding climate change the company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its currently and formerly owned and leased facilities in addition some of its present and former facilities have been or had been in operation for many years and over that time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that those sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom the company has sent waste may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation it is possible that the company could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 

 

the company had a recorded liability of 15 million and 16 million at june 30 2011 and 2010 respectively for its share of aggregate future remediation costs related to certain environmental matters including superfund and other response actions at various locations one matter in dickinson county michigan for which the company is jointly and severally liable accounts for a substantial majority of the recorded liability at both june 30 2011 and 2010 the company has agreed to be liable for 243 of the aggregate remediation and associated costs for this matter pursuant to a costsharing arrangement with a third party with the assistance of environmental consultants the company maintains an undiscounted liability representing its current best estimate of its share of the capital expenditures maintenance and other costs that may be incurred over an estimated 30year remediation period currently the company cannot accurately predict the timing of future payments that may be made under this obligation in addition the company’s estimated loss exposure is sensitive to a variety of uncertain factors including the efficacy of remediation efforts changes in remediation requirements and the timing varying costs and alternative cleanup technologies that may become available in the future although it is possible that the company’s exposure may exceed the amount recorded any amount of such additional exposures or range of exposures is not estimable at this time 

 

the company also handles andor transports hazardous substances including but not limited to chlorine at its plant sites including the rail transit of liquid chlorine from its point of origin to the company’s manufacturing facilities a release of such chemicals whether in transit or at the company’s facilities due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability the company has incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations and such expenditures reduce the cash flow available to the company for other purposes 

 

failure to maximize successfully assert or successfully defend the company’s intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness 

 

the company relies on intellectual property rights based on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its brands and its products and the packaging for those products the company cannot be certain that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions the company cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be invalidated circumvented or challenged and the company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert its intellectual property rights or to defend those rights from assertions of invalidity in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if other parties infringe the company’s intellectual property rights they may dilute the value of the company’s brands in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the company’s brands and harm its sales the failure to perfect or successfully assert its intellectual property rights could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

 

 

 

if the company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others its competitiveness could be negatively impacted 

 

one of the company’s strategies is to improve its products by licensing thirdparty ideas and technologies in a process refered to as “o pen innovation  ” if the company is found to have violated the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of such thirdparty ideas or technologies arising from its open innovation projects such a finding could result in the need to cease use of a trademark trade secret copyrighted work or patented invention in the company’s business and the obligation to pay a substantial amount for past infringement it could also be necessary to pay a substantial amount in the future for rights if holders are willing to permit the company to continue to use such intellectual property rights either having to cease use or pay such amounts could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on its business operating results and financial condition 

 

the company’s substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its operations and financial results and prevent the company from fulfilling its obligations and the company may incur substantially more debt in the future which could exacerbate these risks 

 

the company has a significant amount of indebtedness as of june 30 2011 the company had 26 billion of debt the company’s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

make it more difficult for the company to satisfy its cash obligations limit the company’s ability to fund potential acquisitions require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness which would reduce the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital requirements capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes limit the company’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to general adverse economic conditions or changes in its business and the industry in which it operates place the company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt and limit along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the company’s indebtedness among other things its ability to borrow additional funds failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could have a significant adverse effect on the company in addition the company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions to repurchase shares or to fund other activities for general business purposes subject to compliance with the company’s existing restrictive debt covenants as of june 30 2011 the company could add approximately 11 billion in incremental debt and remain in compliance with restrictive debt covenants although there is no assurance that the actual amount that the company may be able to borrow in the future will equal this amount if new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that the company now faces could intensify in addition the cost of incurring additional debt could increase due to possible downgrades in the company’s credit rating any decision regarding the company’s future borrowings will be based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time including the company’s credit rating if the company were to borrow the maximum amount available to it its credit rating could be downgraded 

 

the company could be adversely affected if its credit ratings were to fall below investment grade 

 

certain terms of the agreements governing the company’s overthecounter derivative instruments contain provisions that require the company’s credit ratings as assigned by standard  poor’s and moody’s to the company and its counterparties to remain at a level equal to or better than the minimum of an investment grade credit rating if the company’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions as of june 30 2011 the company and each of its counterparties maintained investmentgrade ratings with both standard  poor’s and moody’s 

 

 

 

the company may not have sufficient cash to service its indebtedness and pay cash dividends 

 

the company’s ability to repay and refinance its indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures depends on the company’s cash flow in addition the company’s ability to pay cash dividends depends on cash flow and net profits as defined by delaware law the company’s cash flow and net profits are often subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond the company’s control and such factors may limit the company’s ability to repay indebtedness pay cash dividends and repatriate earnings at an effective cost 

 

the facilities of the company and its suppliers are subject to disruption by events beyond the company’s control 

 

operations at the facilities of the company and its suppliers and retail customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages disease outbreaks or pandemics acts of war terrorism fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters in addition the company’s corporate headquarters and technical center are located near major earthquake fault lines in california if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment temporary loss of access to critical data delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations 

 

the company’s continued growth and expansion and increasing reliance on thirdparty service providers could adversely affect its internal control over financial reporting which could harm its business and financial results 

 

clorox management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the company’s financial statements would be prevented or detected the company’s continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets will place significant additional pressure on the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting moreover the company increasingly engages the services of third parties to assist with business operations and financial reporting processes which inserts additional monitoring obligations and risk into the system of internal control any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the company’s ability to report its financial results accurately and on a timely basis or to detect and prevent fraud 

 

a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact the company’s ability to conduct business 

 

the company relies extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers in order to conduct business these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to communicating within the company and with other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping products to customers processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements and other processes involved in managing the business the company is implementing certain enterprisewide upgrades to the company’s hardware software and operating systems including initiating an international enterprise resource planning system erp in order to support the company’s existing operations and future growth if the company’s existing andor future technology systems and processes do not adequately support the future growth of the company’s business the company’s business may be adversely impacted although the company has network security measures in place the systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses security breaches and other similar disruptions from unauthorized users while the company has business continuity plans in place if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes including catastrophic events power outages security breaches or other similar events and if the business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in the ability to manage or conduct business which may adversely impact the company’s business 

 

 

 

the company’s judgments regarding accounting policies and the resolution of tax disputes may impact the company’s earnings and cash flow 

 

significant judgment is required in determining the company’s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions the company provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement criteria prescribed by applicable accounting standards fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties may impact the company’s effective tax rate when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution for additional information refer to the information set forth in note 19  income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 49 of exhibit 991 hereto 

 

the estimates and assumptions on which the company’s financial statement projections are based may prove to be inaccurate which may cause its actual results to materially differ from such projections 

 

the company’s financial statement projections are dependent on certain estimates and assumptions related to among other things estimates of liabilities goodwill category growth market share projections and the company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in its existing business fund internal growth repurchase its shares make acquisitions pay dividends and meet debt obligations while the company’s projections are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made the company’s actual results may differ materially from its financial outlook any material variation between the company’s projections and its actual results may adversely affect its stock price 

 

there can be no guarantee that the company will continue to make dividend payments or repurchase its stock 

 

although the company’s board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program and adopted a dividend policy under which the company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends on its common stock any determinations by the company to continue to repurchase its common stock or by the board of directors to continue to pay cash dividends on its common stock will be based primarily upon the company’s financial condition results of operations business requirements price of its common stock in the case of the repurchase program  and board of directors’ continuing determination that the repurchase program and the declaration of dividends under the dividend policy are in the best interests of the company’s stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs 

 

the company’s business could be negatively affected as a result of an unsolicited takeover proposal or a proxy contest 

 

in july 2011 the company received an unsolicited conditional proposal from carl icahn and certain of his affiliated entities to purchase all of the outstanding shares of the company subsequently the company received a notice from carl icahn and certain of his affiliates that announced their intent to nominate 11 individuals for election to its board of directors the unsolicited proposal and proxy contest could have an adverse effect on the company’s business because 

responding to unsolicited takeover proposals and other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and timeconsuming disrupting the company’s operations and diverting the attention of its management and employees perceived uncertainties as to the company’s future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners and if completed a takeover may result in a changeincontrol under certain of the company’s longterm indebtedness agreements and may require it to repurchase certain outstanding debt securities or result in an acceleration of certain indebtedness in addition any unsolicited offer could cause the company’s stock price to fluctuate significantly

the company faces intense competition in its markets which could lead to reduced profitability 

 

the company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the us and in its international markets most of the company’s products compete with other widelyadvertised brands within each product category and with “private label” brands and “generic” nonbranded products of grocery chains and wholesale cooperatives in certain categories which typically are sold at lower prices 

 

the company’s products generally compete on the basis of product performance brand recognition price value or other benefits to consumers advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on consumer purchasing decisions a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position 

 

some of the company’s competitors are larger and have financial resources greater than those of the company these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the company can in addition the company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the company competitive activity may require the company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions andor reduce prices and could lead to reduced profits and could adversely affect growth 

 

unfavorable general economic conditions and financial market volatility may negatively impact the company’s financial performance and liquidity 

 

although the company continues to devote significant resources to support its brands unfavorable economic conditions may negatively affect consumer demand for the company’s products consumers may reduce discretionary spending due to economic uncertainty or unfavorable economic conditions and this may lead to reduced sales volumes or cause a shift in the company’s product mix from higher margin to lower margin products consumers may increase purchases of lowerpriced or nonbranded products and the company’s competitors may increase levels of promotional activity for lowerpriced products as they seek to maintain sales volumes during recessionary periods 

 

 

in addition global markets have continued to experience significant disruptions during fiscal year 2010 and continuing volatility could harm the company’s business although the company currently generates significant cash flows from ongoing operations and has access to global credit markets through its financing activities and existing credit facilities if the current credit conditions were to worsen the company might not be able to access credit markets on favorable terms which could adversely affect the company’s ability to borrow financial market volatility and unfavorable economic conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of the company’s customers suppliers and other business partners if customers’ financial conditions are severely affected the company may not be able to collect account receivables in addition the decline in the equity markets and the valuation of other assets precipitated by the credit crisis and financial system disruptions has affected the value of the company’s pension plan assets the lower pension plan asset base has negatively affected the return on plan assets and has increased the company’s pension expense as a result the company has contributed additional pension funding if current market conditions worsen or continue for a prolonged period of time it could have an additional negative impact on future pension expense and cash flow 

 

sales growth may be difficult to achieve 

 

a large percentage of the company’s revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to increased competition during fiscal year 2010 approximately 80 of the company’s net sales were generated in us markets us markets for cleaning products are considered mature and are generally characterized by high household penetration the company’s ability to achieve sales growth will depend on its ability to drive growth through innovation investment in its established brands and enhanced merchandising and its ability to capture market share from competitors in addition price increases may slow sales growth or create declines in sales in the short term as consumers adjust to price increases if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product improvements undertake sales marketing and advertising initiatives that grow its product categories and develop acquire or successfully launch new products it may not achieve its sales growth objectives 

 

the company is subject to foreign exchange rate risk and uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets 

 

the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar although the company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks these hedges only offset a small portion of the company’s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and its reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 

 

in addition to foreign exchange rate risks the company faces and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations including 

economic or political instability in its international markets particularly in latin america and particularly in venezuela   difficulty in obtaining nonlocal currency eg us dollars euros to pay for the raw materials needed to manufacture the company’s products and contractmanufactured products particularly in venezuela   restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the united states including possible taxes or withholding obligations on any repatriations and   the imposition of tariffs trade restrictions price restrictions or other governmental actions generating a negative impact on our business these risks could have a significant impact on the company’s ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position the company’s small sales volume in some countries relative to some multinational and local competitors could exacerbate such risks 

 

 

also the company’s operations outside the united states are subject to risks relating to potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations import and export laws credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences 

 

for further information regarding the impact of currency exchange rates and uncertain conditions in international markets see “venezuela” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on pages 14 through 16 of exhibit 991 hereto 

 

operations outside of the united states may be affected by legal and regulatory risks and government reviews inquiries or investigations could harm the company’s business 

 

the company’s operations outside the united states are subject to risks relating to compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in the united states and in local jurisdictions additionally there is a risk of potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls from time to time the company may conduct internal investigations and compliance reviews to ensure that the company is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations additionally the company could be subject to inquiries or investigations by government and other regulatory bodies any determination that the company’s operations or activities are not in compliance with united states laws including the foreign corrupt practices act or various international laws and regulations could expose the company to significant fines penalties or other sanctions that may harm the business and reputation of the company 

 

acquisitions new venture investments and divestitures may not be successful 

 

in connection with the company’s strategy the company may seek to increase growth through acquisitions not only is the identification of good acquisition candidates difficult and competitive but these transactions also involve numerous risks including the ability to 

successfully integrate acquired companies products systems or personnel into the company’s existing business especially with respect to businesses or operations that are outside of the united states   minimize any potential interruption to the ongoing business of the company   successfully enter categories and markets in which the company may have limited or no prior experience   achieve expected synergies and obtain the desired financial or strategic benefits from acquisitions   retain key relationships with employees customers partners and suppliers of acquired companies and   maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies throughout acquired companies 13 

 

 

companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt the assumption of contingent liabilities the increase in expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition future acquisitions of foreign companies would increase the company’s exposure to foreign exchange risks in addition to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the company’s acquisitions diminish in the future the company may be required to record additional writedowns of goodwill intangible assets or other assets associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect its operating results 

 

the company may also decide to divest certain assets businesses or brands that do not meet the company’s strategic objectives or growth targets with respect to any divestiture the company may encounter difficulty finding potential acquirers or other divestiture options on favorable terms any divestiture could affect the profitability of the company either as a result of the gains or losses on such sale of a business or brand the loss of the operating income resulting from such sale or the costs or liabilities that are not assumed by the acquirer that may negatively impact profitability subsequent to any divestiture the company may also be required to recognize impairment charges as the result of a divesture 

 

any potential future acquisitions new ventures or divestitures may divert the attention of management and may divert resources from matters that are core or critical to the business 

 

the company may not successfully develop and introduce new products and line extensions 

 

the company’s future performance and growth depends on its ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and line extensions and product improvements the company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve those goals the development and introduction of new products require substantial and effective research development and marketing expenditures which the company may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance new product development and marketing efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays which could result in the company not being first to market the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance and the cost of failed product introductions 

  

dependence on key customers could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the company’s net sales net sales to the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates were 27 for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 and 26 for fiscal year 2008 of consolidated net sales and occurred in each of the company’s reportable segments no other customers exceeded 10 of consolidated net sales in any of these years during fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 the company’s five largest customers accounted for 45 43 and 42 of its net sales respectively the company expects that a significant portion of its revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers as a result changes in the strategies of the company’s largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to “privatelabel” or competitors’ products may harm the company’s sales additionally this may reduce the ability of the company to bring new innovative products to consumers 

 

in addition the company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders and the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its customers accordingly these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the company at any time and for any reason if the company does not effectively respond to the demands of its customers they could decrease their purchases from the company causing the company’s sales and profits to decline in recent years the company has seen increasing retailer consolidation both in the us and internationally this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailers which may demand lower pricing or special packaging or impose other requirements on product suppliers these business demands may relate to inventory practices logistics or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship if the company ceases doing business with a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease the company’s business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

 

 

the company’s financial results could suffer if the company is unable to implement its strategies or if the company’s strategies do not achieve the intended effects 

 

there is no assurance that the company will be able to implement its strategies or will achieve its intended growth targets if the company is unable to implement its strategies in accordance with its expectations the company’s financial results could be adversely affected moreover the company cannot be certain that implementation of its strategies will necessarily advance the company’s business or financial results 

 

profitability could suffer if the company is unable to generate anticipated savings and efficiencies including through its supply chain restructuring and other restructuring plans 

 

the company’s success and profitability depend on the efficient manufacture and production of products historically the company has undertaken restructuring programs and incurred restructuring charges and expects to continue to restructure its operations as necessary to improve operational efficiency for example beginning in fiscal year 2008 the company began a supply chain restructuring involving closing certain domestic and international manufacturing facilities and redistributing production between the remaining facilities and thirdparty producers to optimize available capacity and reduce operating costs gaining additional efficiencies may become increasingly difficult over time and any failure to successfully execute such changes may result in supply chain interruption which may negatively impact product volume and margins in addition one of the company’s key strategies is to reduce waste lower costs and increase productivity the company sets aggressive annual cost savings targets in support of this strategy failure to reduce costs through productivity gains and operating model efficiencies could adversely affect profitability 

 

price increases in raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies or services could harm the company’s profits 

 

increases in the cost of raw materials including resin chloralkali sodium hypochlorite linerboard soybean oil solvent natural oils corrugate and other chemicals and agricultural commodities or increases in the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services including the cost of diesel may harm the company’s profits and operating results if price increases for any of the primary raw materials or other necessary supplies or services occur and the company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset such price increases its profits and operating results will be harmed in addition if the company increases the prices of its products in response to increases in the cost of commodities and the commodity costs decline the company may not be able to sustain its price increases over time also competitors may not adjust their prices which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume and while the company seeks to project tradeoffs between price increases and volume its projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases 

 

for further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices see “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on page 20 of exhibit 991 hereto 

 

reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in disruption to the company’s business 

 

the company relies on a limited number of suppliers including solesource and singlesource suppliers for certain of its raw materials packaging product components finished products and other necessary supplies if the company is unable to maintain supplier arrangements and relationships or if it is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity and quality levels needed for its business or if any of the company’s key suppliers becomes insolvent or experiences other financial distress the company could experience disruptions in production and its financial results could be adversely affected 

 

 

additional government regulations could impose material costs 

 

generally the manufacture packaging labeling storage distribution and advertising of the company’s products and the conduct of its business operations must all comply with extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations for example in the united states many of the company’s products are regulated by the environmental protection agency the food and drug administration and the consumer product safety commission and the company’s product claims and advertising are regulated by the federal trade commission in addition security at certain of the company’s facilities is regulated by the department of homeland security most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies in addition the company’s international operations are subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products if the company is found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas it could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent the company from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results particularly with respect to its charcoal business it is possible that the federal government will increase regulation of the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to enhance homeland security or protect the environment and that such regulation could negatively impact the company’s ability to obtain raw materials or could increase costs in addition pending legislative initiatives and newly adopted legislation such as the patient protection and affordable care act the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act in the areas of healthcare reform and other initiatives and legislation in the area of taxation of foreign profits executive compensation and corporate governance could also increase the companys costs 

 

product liability claims could adversely affect the company’s sales and operating results 

 

the company may be required to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products claims could be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants or provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances or damage property product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s sales and operating results in addition if one of the company’s products is found to be defective the company could be required to recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or certain product liability claims may be excluded under the terms of the policy 

 

environmental matters create potential liability risks 

 

the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to air emissions water discharges the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances the company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its currently and formerly owned and leased facilities in addition some of its present and former facilities have been or had been in operation for many years and over that time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that those sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom the company has sent waste may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation it is possible that the company could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 

 

 

at june 30 2010 the company had a recorded liability of 16 million for its future remediation costs one matter in dickinson county michigan for which the company is jointly and severally liable accounts for a substantial majority of the recorded liability the company is subject to a costsharing arrangement with ford motor co ford for this matter under which the company has agreed to be liable for 243 of the aggregate remediation and associated costs other than legal fees as it and ford are each responsible for their own such fees in october 2004 the company and ford agreed to a consent judgment with the michigan department of environmental quality which sets forth certain remediation goals and monitoring activities based on the current status of this matter and with the assistance of environmental consultants the company maintains an undiscounted liability representing its best estimate of its share of costs associated with the capital expenditures maintenance and other costs to be incurred over an estimated 30year remediation period the most significant components of the liability relate to the estimated costs associated with the remediation of groundwater contamination and excess levels of subterranean methane deposits the company made payments of less than 1 million in fiscal years 2010 and 2009 respectively towards remediation efforts currently the company cannot accurately predict the timing of the payments that will likely be made under this estimated obligation in addition the estimated loss exposure is sensitive to a variety of uncertain factors including the efficacy of remediation efforts changes in remediation requirements and the timing varying costs and alternative cleanup technologies that may become available in the future although it is possible that the company’s exposure may exceed the amount recorded any amount of such additional exposures or range of exposures is not estimable at this time 

 

the company also handles andor transports hazardous substances including but not limited to chlorine at its plant sites including the rail transit of liquid chlorine from its point of origin to the company’s manufacturing facilities a release of such chemicals whether in transit or at the company’s facilities due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability the company has incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations and such expenditures reduce the cash flow available to the company for other purposes 

 

failure to maximize successfully assert or successfully defend the company’s intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness 

 

the company relies on intellectual property rights based on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its brands its products and the packaging for those products the company cannot be certain that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions the company cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be invalidated circumvented or challenged and the company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert its intellectual property rights or to defend those rights from assertions of invalidity in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if other parties infringe the company’s intellectual property rights they may dilute the value of the company’s brands in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the company’s brands and harm its sales the failure to perfect or successfully assert its intellectual property rights could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

 

if the company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others its competitiveness could be negatively impacted 

 

if the company is found to have violated the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others such a finding could result in the need to cease use of a trademark trade secret copyrighted work or patented invention in the company’s business and the obligation to pay a substantial amount for past infringement in some instances the company may not be able to obtain the intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions or ongoing sales it could also be necessary to pay a substantial amount in the future for rights if holders are willing to permit the company to continue to use the intellectual property rights either having to cease use or pay such amounts could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on its business operating results and financial condition 

 

 

  

the company’s substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its operations and financial results and prevent the company from fulfilling its obligations 

 

the company has a significant amount of indebtedness as of june 30 2010 the company had 28 billion of debt the company’s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could   

make it more difficult for the company to satisfy its cash obligations   increase the company’s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions   limit the company’s ability to fund potential acquisitions   require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness which would reduce the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital requirements capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes   limit the company’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and the industry in which it operates   place the company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt and   limit along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the company’s indebtedness among other things its ability to borrow additional funds failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could have a significant adverse effect on the company the company may not have sufficient cash to service its indebtedness and pay cash dividends 

 

the company’s ability to repay and refinance its indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures depends on the company’s cash flow in addition the company’s ability to pay cash dividends depends on cash flow and net profits as defined by delaware law the company’s cash flow and net profits are often subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond the company’s control and such factors may limit the company’s ability to repay indebtedness and pay cash dividends 

 

the company may incur substantially more debt which could further exacerbate the risks described above 

 

the company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions to repurchase shares or to fund other activities for general business purposes subject to compliance with the company’s existing restrictive debt covenants as of june 30 2010 the company could add approximately 13 billion in incremental debt and remain in compliance with restrictive debt covenants if new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that the company now faces could intensify in addition the cost of incurring additional debt could increase due to possible downgrades in the company’s credit rating 

 

the facilities of the company and its suppliers are subject to disruption by events beyond the company’s control 

 

operations at the facilities of the company and its suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages disease outbreaks or pandemics acts of war terrorism fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters in addition the company’s corporate headquarters and technical center are located near major earthquake fault lines in california if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment temporary loss of access to critical data delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations 

 

  

  the company’s continued growth and expansion and increasing reliance on third party service providers could adversely affect its internal control over financial reporting which could harm its business and financial results 

 

clorox management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the company’s financial statements would be prevented or detected the company’s continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets will place significant additional pressure on the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting moreover the company increasingly engages the services of third parties to assist with business operations and financial reporting processes which inserts additional monitoring obligations and risk into the system of internal control any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the company’s ability to report its financial results accurately and on a timely basis or to detect and prevent fraud 

 

a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact the company’s ability to conduct business 

 

the company relies extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers in order to conduct business these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to communicating within the company and with other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping products to customers processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements and other processes involved in managing the business the company is implementing enterprisewide upgrades to the company’s hardware software and operating systems including initiating an international enterprise resource planning system erp in order to support the company’s existing operations and future growth if the company’s existing andor future technology systems and processes do not adequately support the future growth of the company’s business the company’s business may be adversely impacted although the company has network security measures in place the systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses security breaches and other similar disruptions from unauthorized users while the company has business continuity plans in place if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes including catastrophic events power outages security breaches or other similar events and if the business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in the ability to manage or conduct business which may adversely impact the company’s business 

 

harm to the company’s reputation or the reputation of one or more of its leading brands could have an adverse effect on the business 

 

maintaining a strong reputation with consumers customers and trade partners is critical to the success of the company’s business the company devotes significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve the company’s reputation and the reputation of its brands these programs include ethics and compliance sustainability and product safety and quality initiatives among others despite these efforts adverse publicity about the company including product safety or quality or similar concerns whether real or perceived could harm the company’s image and result in an adverse effect on its business as well as require resources to rebuild its reputation 

 

  

  

resolutions of tax disputes may impact the company’s earnings and cash flow 

 

significant judgment is required in determining the company’s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions on july 1 2007 the company adopted an accounting standard that provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards prescribed by the applicable accounting standards changes to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties impact the company’s effective tax rate when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the company’s effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution for additional information refer to the information set forth in note 19  income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 56 of exhibit 991 hereto

competition 

the markets for consumer products are highly competitive most of the company’s products compete with other nationally advertised brands within each category and with “private label” brands and “generic” nonbranded products in certain categories competition is encountered from similar and alternative products some of which are produced and marketed by major multinational or national companies having financial resources greater than those of the company depending on the product the company’s products compete on product performance brand recognition price value or other benefits to consumers a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising support if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support and ongoing product improvement to maintain its relative market position

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risks and uncertainties as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report or in other filings by the company with the sec could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the company or that are not currently believed by the company to be material may also harm the company’s business operations and financial results 

the impact of general economic conditions in the united states and in other countries in which the company currently does business the impact of currency fluctuations significant increases in the costs of energy and transportation including the cost of diesel or of key raw materials including but not limited to resin chloralkali corrugate agricultural commodities and other raw materials the availability and cost of debt financing changes to cash flow resulting from the company’s operating results tax settlement payments debt repayments and share repurchases 8 

fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes the ability of the company to successfully execute its strategies including its centennial strategy expenses for impairment and obsolescence of property plant and equipment in excess of projections expenses for impairment of goodwill trademarks and other intangible assets and equity investments in excess of projections the introduction of new products and line extensions by the company or its competitors the impact of potential emerging technologies on the company’s existing product lines including any potential future obsolescence consumer and customer reaction to price increases changes in product pricing by the company or its competitors the impact of customer inventory reductions or shelf simplification initiatives the mix of products sold within different channels and countries with varying profitability in a given quarter the ability of the company to manage inventory at appropriate levels including decisions regarding obsolescence the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel charges resulting from any restructuring that management may from time to time choose to undertake the impact of changing accounting principles and standards expenses for impairment of goodwill trademarks and other intangible assets and equity investments in excess of projections the effectiveness of the company’s advertising marketing and promotional programs the company’s ability to control internal costs and generate expected cost savings and efficiencies the ability of the company to achieve its business plans including volume growth and pricing plans as a result of high levels of competitive activity the ability of the company to penetrate and grow international markets the ability of the company to maintain key retail customer relationships the impact of potential emerging technologies on the company’s existing product lines including any potential future obsolescence significant increases in interest rates insurance costs or in pension healthcare or other employee benefit costs the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel the impact of changes in the market value of investments including those investments held in the company’s pension plan and any resulting funding requirements the ability of the company to successfully manage regulatory tax and legal matters including the resolution of pending matters within current estimates the impact of any litigation or product liability claims the impact of environmental remediation costs including those for which the company is jointly and severally liable the ability of the company to maintain the value and reputation of its brands the ability of the company to maintain key retail customer relationships the effectiveness of the company’s advertising marketing and promotional programs the ability of the company to maintain and enhance profits in the face of a consolidating retail environment the ability of the company to penetrate and grow international markets and the impact of foreign import and export restrictions or other trade regulations in addition sales volume growth whether due to acquisitions or to internal growth can burden management resources and financial controls that in turn can have a negative impact on operating results and net earnings to some extent the company sets its expense levels in anticipation of future revenues if actual revenue falls short of these expectations operating results and net earnings are likely to be adversely affected 

the company faces intense competition in its markets which could lead to reduced profitability 

the company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the us and in its international markets most of the company’s products compete with other widelyadvertised brands within each product category and with “private label” brands and “generic” nonbranded products of grocery chains and wholesale cooperatives in certain categories which typically are sold at lower prices 

the company’s products generally compete on the basis of product performance brand recognition price value or other benefits to consumers advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on consumer purchasing decisions a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position 

some of the company’s competitors are larger and have financial resources greater than those of the company these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the company can in addition the company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the company competitive activity may require the company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions or reduce prices and could lead to reduced profits and could adversely affect growth 

unfavorable general economic conditions and financial market volatility may negatively impact the company’s financial performance and liquidity 

although the company continues to devote significant resources to support its brands unfavorable economic conditions may negatively affect consumer demand for the company’s products consumers may reduce discretionary spending due to economic uncertainty or unfavorable economic conditions and this may lead to reduced sales volumes or cause a shift in the company’s product mix from higher margin to lower margin products consumers may increase purchases of lowerpriced or nonbranded products and the company’s competitors may increase levels of promotional activity for lowerpriced products as they seek to maintain sales volumes during the downturn 

in addition global financial markets have experienced unprecedented disruptions during fiscal year 2009 and continuing volatility could harm the company’s business although the company currently generates significant cash flows from ongoing operations and has access to global credit markets through its financing activities and existing credit facilities if the current credit conditions were to worsen the company might not be able to access credit markets on favorable terms which could adversely affect the company’s ability to borrow financial market volatility and unfavorable economic conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of our customers suppliers and other business partners in addition the decline in the equity markets and the valuation of other assets precipitated by the credit crisis and financial system disruptions has affected the value of the company’s pension plan assets the lower pension plan asset base has negatively affected the return on plan assets increased the company’s pension expense and required additional pension funding if current market conditions worsen or continue for a prolonged period of time it could have an additional negative impact on future pension expense and cash flow 

sales growth may be difficult to achieve 

a large percentage of the company’s revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to increased competition during fiscal year 2009 approximately 80 of the company’s net sales were generated in us markets us markets for household products are considered mature and are generally characterized by high household penetration the company’s ability to achieve sales growth will depend on its ability to drive growth through innovation investment in its established brands and enhanced merchandising and its ability to capture market share from competitors in addition price increases may slow sales growth or create declines in sales in the short term as consumers adjust to price increases if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product improvements undertake sales marketing and advertising initiatives that grow its product categories and develop acquire or successfully launch new products it may not achieve its sales growth objectives 

operations outside the united states expose the company to foreign exchange rate risk uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets 

the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar although the company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks these hedges only offset a small portion of the company’s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and its reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates moreover any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time 

in addition to foreign exchange rate risks the company faces and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations including 

economic or political instability in its international markets particularly in latin america difficulty in obtaining us dollars to pay for the raw materials needed to manufacture the company’s products particularly in venezuela restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the united states including possible taxes or withholding obligations on any repatriations and the imposition of tariffs trade restrictions or other governmental actions these risks could have a significant impact on the company’s ability to sell its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position the company’s small sales volume in some countries relative to some multinational and local competitors could exacerbate such risks 

also the company’s operations outside the united states are subject to risks relating to compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences 

the company may not successfully develop and introduce new products and line extensions 

the company’s future performance and growth depends on its ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and line extensions the company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve those goals the development and introduction of new products requires substantial and effective research development and marketing expenditures which the company may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance new product development and marketing efforts including entering markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays which could result in the company not being first to market the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance and the cost of failed product introductions 

dependence on key customers could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the company’s net sales the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its domestic and international affiliated companies accounted for approximately 27 26 and 26 of the company’s net sales during fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 during fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 the company’s five largest customers accounted for 43 42 and 42 respectively of its total consolidated net sales the company expects that a significant portion of its revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers as a result changes in the strategies of the company’s largest customers including shelf simplification or a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to “privatelabel” or competitors’ products may harm the company’s sales 

in addition the company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders and the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its customers accordingly these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the company at any time and for any reason if the company does not effectively respond to the demands of its customers they could decrease their purchases from the company causing the company’s sales and profits to decline in recent years the company has seen increasing retailer consolidation both in the us and internationally this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailers who may demand lower pricing or special packaging or impose other requirements on product suppliers these business demands may relate to inventory practices logistics or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship if the company ceases doing business with a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease the company’s business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

the company’s financial results could suffer if the company is unable to implement its strategies or if the company’s strategies do not achieve the intended effects 

there is no assurance that the company will be able to implement its strategies including its centennial strategy or will achieve its intended growth targets if the company is unable to implement its strategies in accordance with its expectations the company’s financial results could be adversely affected moreover the company cannot be certain that implementation of its strategies will necessarily advance the company’s business or financial results 

profitability could suffer if the company is unable to generate anticipated savings and efficiencies including through its supply chain restructuring and operating model changes 

the company’s success and profitability depend on efficient manufacture and production of products beginning in fiscal year 2008 the company began a supply chain restructuring involving closing certain domestic and international manufacturing facilities and redistributing production between the remaining facilities and thirdparty producers to optimize available capacity and reduce operating costs gaining additional efficiencies may become increasingly difficult over time and any failure to successfully execute such changes may result in supply chain interruption which may negatively impact product volume and margins in addition one of the company’s key strategies is to reduce waste lower costs and increase productivity the company sets aggressive annual cost savings targets in support of this strategy failure to reduce costs through productivity gains and operating model efficiencies could adversely affect profitability 

price increases in raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies or services could harm the company’s profits 

increases in the cost of raw materials including resin chloralkali linerboard soybean oil solvent natural oils corrugate and other chemicals and agricultural commodities or increases in the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services including the cost of diesel may harm the company’s profits and operating results if price increases for any of the primary raw materials or other necessary supplies or services occur and the company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset such price increases its profits and operating results will be harmed in addition if the company increases the prices of its products in response to increases in the cost of commodities and the commodity costs decline the company may not be able to sustain its price increases over time sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume and while the company seeks to project tradeoffs between price increases and volume its projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases 

for further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices see “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on pages 16 through 17 of exhibit 991 hereto incorporated herein by reference 

reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in disruption to the company’s business 

the company relies on a limited number of suppliers including sole suppliers for certain of its raw materials packaging product components finished products and other necessary supplies if the company is unable to maintain supplier arrangements and relationships or if it is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity and quality levels needed for its business or if any of the company’s key suppliers becomes insolvent or experiences other financial distress the company could experience disruptions in production and its financial results could be adversely affected 

acquisitions and new venture investments may not be successful 

in connection with the company’s centennial strategy the company may seek to increase growth through acquisitions not only is the identification of good acquisition candidates difficult and competitive but these transactions also involve numerous risks including the ability to 

successfully integrate acquired companies products or personnel into the company’s existing business achieve expected synergies and obtain the desired financial or strategic benefits from acquisitions retain key relationships with employees customers partners and suppliers of acquired companies and maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies throughout acquired companies companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt the assumption of contingent liabilities the increase in amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition future acquisitions of foreign companies would increase the company’s exposure to foreign exchange risks in addition to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the company’s acquisitions diminish in the future the company may be required to record additional writedowns of goodwill intangible assets or other assets associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect its operating results 

in november 2007 the company acquired burt’s bees inc a leading manufacturer and marketer of natural personal care products for an aggregate purchase price of 913 million excluding 25 million of associated tax benefits there is no assurance that the company will be able to achieve the sales and profit growth or increased distribution in the burt’s bees business that management has projected 

additional government regulations could impose material costs 

generally the manufacture packaging labeling storage distribution and advertising of the company’s products and the conduct of its business operations must all comply with extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations for example in the united states many of the company’s products are regulated by the environmental protection agency the food and drug administration and the consumer product safety commission and the company’s product claims and advertising are regulated by the federal trade commission in addition security at certain of our facilities is regulated by the department of homeland security most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies in addition the company’s international operations are subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products if the company is found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas it could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent the company from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results particularly with respect to its charcoal business it is possible that the federal government will increase regulation of the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to enhance homeland security or protect the environment and that such regulation could negatively impact the company’s ability to obtain raw material or increase costs in addition pending legislative initiatives such as in the areas of healthcare reform taxation of foreign profits and corporate governance and executive compensation could also increase the companys costs 

product liability claims could adversely affect the company’s sales and operating results 

the company may be required to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products claims could be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants or provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances or damage property product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s sales and operating results in addition if one of the company’s products is found to be defective the company could be required to recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or certain product liability claims may be excluded under the terms of the policy 

environmental matters create potential liability risks 

the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to air emissions water discharges the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances the company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its currently and formerly owned and leased facilities in addition some of its present and former facilities have been or had been in operation for many years and over that time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that those sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom the company has sent waste may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation it is possible that the company could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 

at june 30 2009 the company had a recorded liability of 19 million for its future remediation costs one matter in dickinson county michigan for which the company is jointly and severally liable accounts for a substantial majority of the recorded liability the company is subject to a costsharing arrangement with ford motor co ford for this matter under which the company has agreed to be liable for 243 of the aggregate remediation and associated costs other than legal fees as it and ford are each responsible for their own such fees if ford is unable to pay its share of the response and remediation obligations the company would likely be responsible for such obligations in october 2004 the company and ford agreed to a consent judgment with the michigan department of environmental quality which sets forth certain remediation goals and monitoring activities based on the current status of this matter and with the assistance of environmental consultants the company maintains an undiscounted liability representing its best estimate of its share of costs associated with the capital expenditures maintenance and other costs to be incurred over an estimated 30year remediation period the most significant components of the liability relate to the estimated costs associated with the remediation of groundwater contamination and excess levels of subterranean methane deposits currently the company cannot accurately predict the timing of the payments that will likely be made under this estimated obligation in addition the estimated loss exposure is sensitive to a variety of uncertain factors including the efficacy of remediation efforts changes in remediation requirements and the timing varying costs and alternative cleanup technologies that may become available in the future although it is possible that the company’s exposure may exceed the amount recorded any amount of such additional exposures or range of exposures is not estimable at this time 

the company also handles andor transports hazardous substances including but not limited to chlorine at its plant sites including the rail transit of liquid chlorine from its point of origin to the company’s manufacturing facilities a release of such chemicals whether in transit or at our facilities due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability the company has incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations and such expenditures reduce the cash flow available to the company for other purposes 

failure to maximize successfully assert or successfully defend the company’s intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness 

the company relies on intellectual property rights based on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its brands its products and the packaging for those products the company cannot be certain that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions the company cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be invalidated circumvented or challenged and the company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert its intellectual property rights or to defend those rights from assertions of invalidity in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if other parties infringe the company’s intellectual property rights they may dilute the value of the company’s brands in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the company’s brands and harm its sales the failure to perfect or successfully assert its intellectual property rights could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

if the company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others its competitiveness could be negatively impacted 

if the company is found to have violated the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others such a finding could result in the need to cease use of a trademark trade secret copyrighted work or patented invention in the company’s business and the obligation to pay a substantial amount for past infringement in some instances the company may not be able to obtain the intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions or ongoing sales it could also be necessary to pay a substantial amount in the future for rights if holders are willing to permit the company to continue to use the intellectual property rights either having to cease use or pay such amounts could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company’s substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its operations and financial results and prevent the company from fulfilling its obligations 

the company has a significant amount of indebtedness as of june 30 2009 the company had 31 billion of debt the company’s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

make it more difficult for the company to satisfy its cash obligations increase the company’s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limit the company’s ability to fund potential acquisitions require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness which would reduce the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital requirements capital expenditures expansion efforts and other general corporate purposes limit the company’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and the industry in which it operates 15 

place the company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt and limit along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the company’s indebtedness among other things its ability to borrow additional funds failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could have a significant adverse effect on the company the company may not have sufficient cash to service its indebtedness and pay cash dividends 

the company’s ability to repay and refinance its indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures depends on the company’s cash flow in addition the company’s ability to pay cash dividends depends on cash flow and net profits as defined by delaware law the company’s cash flow and net profits are often subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond the company’s control and such factors may limit the company’s ability to repay indebtedness and pay cash dividends 

the company may incur substantially more debt which could further exacerbate the risks described above 

the company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions to repurchase shares or to fund other activities for general business purposes subject to compliance with the company’s existing restrictive debt covenants as of june 30 2009 the company could add approximately 600 million in incremental debt and remain in compliance with restrictive debt covenants if new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that the company now faces could intensify in addition the cost of incurring additional debt could increase due to possible additional downgrades in the company’s credit rating 

the facilities of the company and its suppliers are subject to disruption by events beyond the company’s control 

operations at the facilities of the company and its suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages disease outbreaks or pandemics acts of war terrorism  fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters in addition the company’s corporate headquarters and technical center are located near major earthquake fault lines in california if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment temporary loss of access to critical data delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations 

the company’s continued growth and expansion and increasing reliance on third party service providers could adversely affect its internal control over financial reporting which could harm its business and financial results 

clorox management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the company’s financial statements would be prevented or detected the company’s continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets will place significant additional pressure on the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting moreover the company increasingly engages the services of third parties to assist with business operations and financial reporting processes which inserts additional monitoring obligations and risk into the system of internal control any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the company’s ability to report its financial results accurately and on a timely basis or to detect and prevent fraud 

harm to the company’s reputation or the reputation of one or more of its leading brands could have an adverse effect on the business 

maintaining a strong reputation with consumers customers and trade partners is critical to the success of the company’s business the company devotes significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve the company’s reputation and the reputation of its brands these programs include ethics and compliance sustainability and product safety and quality initiatives among others despite these efforts adverse publicity about the company including product safety or quality or similar concerns whether real or perceived could harm the company’s image and result in an adverse effect on its business as well as require resources to rebuild its reputation 

resolutions of tax disputes may impact the company’s earnings and cash flow 

significant judgment is required in determining the company’s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions on july 1 2007 the company adopted fasb interpretation no fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of financial accounting standards board statement no 109  the company provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards prescribed by fin 48 changes to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties impact the company’s effective tax rate when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the company’s effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution for additional information refer to the information set forth in note 20  income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 53 of exhibit 991 hereto incorporated herein by reference

the company’s operating results and net earnings may not meet expectations 

the company cannot be certain that its operating results and net earnings will meet its expectations if the company’s assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition or if the company does not achieve all of its key goals then its actual performance could vary materially from its expectations the company’s operating results and net earnings may be influenced by a number of factors including the following

 in addition sales volume growth whether due to acquisitions or to internal growth can place burdens on management resources and financial controls that in turn can have a negative impact on operating results and net earnings to some extent the company sets its expense levels in anticipation of future revenues if actual revenue falls short of these expectations operating results and net earnings are likely to be adversely affected 

price increases in raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies or services could harm the company’s profits 

during fiscal year 2008 the company experienced commodity and energy cost increases of approximately 137 million and the company expects greater increases in these costs in fiscal year 2009 by an estimated 180 million to 200 million increases in the cost of raw materials including resin chloralkali linerboard soybean oil solvent natural oils and other chemicals and agricultural commodities or increases in the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services including the cost of diesel may harm the company’s profits and operating results if price increases for any of the primary raw materials or other necessary supplies or services occur and the company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset such price increases its profits and operating results will be harmed in addition if the company increases the prices of its products in response to increases in the cost of commodities and the commodity costs decline the company may not be able to sustain its price increases over time 

for further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices see “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on page 16 of exhibit 991 hereto incorporated herein by reference 

reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in disruption to the company’s business

page 10 

the company faces intense competition in its markets which could lead to reduced profitability 

the company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the us and in its international markets most of the company’s products compete with other widelyadvertised brands within each product category and with “private label” brands and “generic” nonbranded products of grocery chains and wholesale cooperatives in certain categories which typically are sold at lower prices the company also encounters competition from similar and alternative products many of which are produced and marketed by major multinational or national companies 

the company’s products generally compete on the basis of product performance brand recognition price quality or other benefits to consumers advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on consumer purchasing decisions a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position 

some of the company’s competitors are larger and have financial resources greater than those of the company these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the company can in addition the company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the company competitive activity may require the company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions or reduce prices and could lead to reduced profits and could adversely affect growth 

volume growth may be difficult to achieve 

a large percentage of the company’s revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to increased competition during fiscal year 2008 approximately 80 of the company’s net sales were generated in us markets us markets for household products are considered mature and are generally characterized by high household penetration the company’s ability to achieve volume growth will depend on its ability to drive growth through innovation investment in its established brands and enhanced merchandising and its ability to capture market share from competitors in addition price increases may slow volume growth or create declines in volume in the short term as consumers adjust to price increases if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product improvements undertake sales and demand building initiatives to grow its product categories and develop acquire or successfully launch new products it may not achieve its volume growth objectives 

the company may not successfully develop and introduce new products and line extensions 

the company’s future performance and growth depends on its ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and line extensions the company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve those goals the development and introduction of new products requires substantial and effective research development and marketing expenditures which the company may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance new product development and marketing efforts have inherent risks including product development or launch delays which could result in the company not being first to market the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance and the cost of failed product introductions

dependence on key customers could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the company’s net sales the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its domestic and international affiliated companies accounted for approximately 26 of the company’s net sales during fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 during fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 the company’s five largest customers accounted for 42 42 and 41 of its total consolidated net sales respectively the company expects that a significant portion of its revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers as a result changes in the strategies of the company’s largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to “privatelabel” or competitors’ products may harm the company’s sales in addition the company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders and the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its customers accordingly these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the company at any time and for any reason if the company ceases doing business with a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease the company’s business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

failure to effectively respond to the demands of the company’s customers could have a significant impact on the company’s business 

the company’s business is dependent on the company’s ability to successfully manage relationships with its retail trade customers if the company does not effectively respond to the demands of its customers they could decrease their purchases from the company causing the company’s sales and profits to decline in recent years the company has seen increasing retailer consolidation both in the us and internationally this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailers who may demand lower pricing or special packaging or impose other requirements on product suppliers these business demands may relate to inventory practices logistics or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship if a large consolidated retailer decreased their purchases from the company due to the company’s inability to meet the retailer’s demands the company’s business could be especially impacted 

the company’s financial results could suffer if the company is unable to implement its centennial strategy or if the centennial strategy does not achieve its intended effects 

the company’s strategic plan named the centennial strategy for the company’s milestone anniversary in 2013 was announced in may 2007 a key driver of the strategy is to accelerate sales by growing existing brands expanding into adjacent product categories entering new sales channels increasing distribution within existing countries and pursuing new business in growing markets where the company can establish and sustain a competitive advantage 

there is no assurance that the company will be able to implement the centennial strategy or achieve the intended growth targets any changes to the company’s portfolio whether through the development of new products or through acquisitions mergers or divestitures are inherently risky and costly the success of such changes depends on many factors including consumer and customer acceptance of new products the integration of any acquired companies and the deployment of proceeds from any divestitures if we are unable to implement the centennial strategy in accordance with our expectations the company’s financial results could be adversely affected moreover the company cannot be certain that successful implementation of the centennial strategy will necessarily advance the company’s business or financial results 

acquisitions and new venture investments may not be successful 

in connection with the company’s centennial strategy the company may seek to increase growth through acquisitions not only is the identification of good acquisition candidates difficult and competitive but these transactions also involve numerous risks including the ability to 

 

   

page 12 

  

  

 companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities andor amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition in addition to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the company’s acquisitions diminish in the future the company may be required to record additional writedowns of goodwill intangible assets or other assets associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect its operating results 

for example in november 2007 the company acquired burt’s bees inc bbi a leading manufacturer and marketer of natural personal care products for an aggregate purchase price of 913 million excluding 25 million of associated tax benefits there is no assurance that the company will be able to achieve the sales and profit growth or increased distribution in the bbi business that management has projected 

in addition any future new venture investments may not be successful in fiscal year 2008 the company terminated certain new venture investments that it decided not to pursue resulting in charges related to the writedown of such investments for additional information see “restructuring and asset impairment costs” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on pages 7 and 8 of exhibit 991 hereto incorporated herein by reference 

operations outside the united states expose the company to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets 

the company’s sales outside the united states were approximately 20 of net sales in fiscal year 2008 and its strategy includes expanding its international business as of june 30 2008 the company owned and operated 20 manufacturing facilities outside the united states the company faces and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations including 

 

  

  

  

 these risks could have a significant impact on the company’s ability to sell its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position the company’s small volume in some countries relative to some multinational and local competitors could exacerbate such risks 

also the company’s operations outside the united states are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences 

  

page 13 

the company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar although the company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks it is not fully protected against foreign currency fluctuations and its reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates moreover any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time 

the share exchange with henkel kgaa henkel could result in significant tax liability 

on november 22 2004 the company completed the exchange of its ownership interest in a subsidiary for henkel’s approximately 614 million shares of the company’s common stock which represented approximately 29 of the company’s common stock prior to the exchange in connection with the exchange the company agreed to indemnify henkel for any taxes imposed on it if the company’s actions result in a breach of the representations and warranties that the company made in its agreement with henkel in a manner that causes the share exchange to fail to qualify as a taxfree distribution under section 355 of the internal revenue code henkel agreed to similar obligations it is expected that the amount of any such taxes to henkel and to the company would be substantial if imposed and the company’s indemnification obligations to henkel are not limited in amount or subject to any cap although certain of the taxes described above would be imposed on henkel the company would in certain circumstances be liable for all or a portion of such taxes during the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 the company entered into an agreement with the irs agreeing to the taxfree treatment of the share exchange transaction henkel has advised the company that the irs has completed its audit of henkel’s us group’s federal income tax return for the year in which the share exchange transaction took place and did not propose any adjustments to henkel’s taxfree treatment of the share exchange transaction nonetheless the company cannot be certain that the share exchange will qualify for taxfree treatment to it or to henkel since the statutes of limitations permitting irs assessment of tax against the company and henkel remain open if the company is required to indemnify henkel under the circumstances set forth in its agreement with henkel it could result in a substantial impact to the company’s financial results and liquidity 

resolutions of tax disputes may impact the company’s earnings and cash flow 

significant judgment is required in determining the company’s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions on july 1 2007 the company adopted fasb interpretation no fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of financial accounting standards board statement no 109  the company provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards prescribed by fin 48 changes to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties impact the company’s effective tax rate when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the company’s effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution for additional information refer to the information set forth in note 20  income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 51 of exhibit 991 hereto incorporated herein by reference 

additional government regulations could impose material costs 

generally the manufacture packaging labeling storage distribution and advertising of the company’s products and the conduct of its business operations must all comply with extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations for example in the united states many of the company’s products are regulated by the environmental protection agency the food and drug administration and the consumer product safety commission and the company’s product claims and advertising are regulated by the federal trade commission in addition security at certain of our facilities is regulated by the department of homeland security most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies in addition the company’s international operations are subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products if the company is found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas it could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent the company from meeting current product 

  

page 14 

demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results particularly with respect to its charcoal business it is possible that the federal government will increase regulation of the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to enhance homeland security or protect the environment and that such regulation could negatively impact the company’s ability to obtain raw material or increase costs 

product liability claims could adversely affect the company’s sales and operating results 

the company may be required to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products claims could be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants or provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s sales and operating results in addition if one of the company’s products is found to be defective the company could be required to recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or certain product liability claims may be excluded under the terms of the policy 

environmental matters create potential liability risks 

the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to air emissions water discharges the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances the company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its currently and formerly owned and leased facilities in addition some of its present and former facilities have been or had been in operation for many years and over that time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that those sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom the company has sent waste may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation it is possible that the company could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 

at june 30 2008 the company had a recorded liability of 20 million for its future remediation costs one matter in dickinson county michigan for which the company is jointly and severally liable accounts for a substantial majority of the recorded liability the company is subject to a costsharing arrangement with another party for this matter and the company has agreed to be liable for 243 of the aggregate remediation and associated costs other than legal fees as it and the other party are each responsible for their own such fees the other party in this matter reported substantial net losses for the full calendar year 2007 and the first half of calendar year 2008 and indicated that it expects substantial net losses for the remainder of calendar year 2008 if the other party with whom the company shares joint and several liability is unable to pay its share of the response and remediation obligations the company would likely be responsible for such obligations in october 2004 the company and the other party agreed to a consent judgment with the michigan department of environmental quality which sets forth certain remediation goals and monitoring activities based on the current status of this matter and with the assistance of environmental consultants the company maintains an undiscounted liability representing its best estimate of its share of costs associated with the capital expenditures maintenance and other costs to be incurred over an estimated 30year remediation period the most significant components of the liability relate to the estimated costs associated with the remediation of groundwater contamination and excess levels of subterranean methane deposits currently the company cannot accurately predict the timing of the payments that will likely be made under this estimated obligation in addition the estimated loss exposure is sensitive to a variety of uncertain factors including the efficacy of remediation efforts changes in remediation requirements and the timing varying costs and alternative cleanup technologies that may become available in the future although it is possible that the company’s exposure may exceed the amount recorded any amount of such additional exposures or range of exposures is not estimable at this time 

the company also handles andor transports hazardous substances including but not limited to chlorine at its plant sites including the rail transit of liquid chlorine from its point of origin to the company’s manufacturing facilities a release of such chemicals whether in transit or at our facilities due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability the company has incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations and such expenditures reduce the cash flow available to the company for other purposes 

  

page 15 

failure to maximize or to successfully assert the company’s intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness 

the company relies on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property rights the company cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions the company cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future and the company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to defend its intellectual property rights in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if other parties infringe the company’s intellectual property rights they may dilute the value of the company’s brands in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the company’s brands and harm its sales the failure to perfect or successfully assert its intellectual property rights could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

if the company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others its competitiveness could be negatively impacted 

if the company is found to have violated the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others such a finding could result in the need to cease use of a trademark trade secret copyrighted work or patented invention in the company’s business and the obligation to pay a substantial amount for past infringement it could also be necessary to pay a substantial amount in the future if the rights holders are willing to permit the company to continue to use the intellectual property rights either having to cease use or pay such amounts could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company’s substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its operations and financial results and prevent the company from fulfilling its obligations 

the company has a significant amount of indebtedness as of june 30 2008 the company had 35 billion of debt the company’s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

page 16 

the company may not have sufficient cash to service its indebtedness and pay cash dividends 

the company’s ability to repay and refinance its indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures depends on the company’s cash flow in addition the company’s ability to pay cash dividends depends on cash flow and net profits as defined by delaware law the company’s cash flow and net profits are often subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond the company’s control and such factors may limit the company’s ability to repay indebtedness and pay cash dividends 

the company may incur substantially more debt which could further exacerbate the risks described above 

the company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions to repurchase shares or to fund other activities for general business purposes subject to compliance with the company’s existing restrictive debt covenants as of june 30 2008 approximately 12 billion was available to borrow under the company’s 12 billion revolving credit facility if new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that the company now faces could intensify in addition the cost of incurring additional debt could increase due to possible additional downgrades in the company’s credit rating 

the facilities of the company and its suppliers are subject to disruption by events beyond the company’s control 

operations at the manufacturing facilities of the company and its suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism pandemics fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters in addition the company’s corporate headquarters and technical center are located near major earthquake fault lines in california if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment temporary loss of access to critical data delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations 

the company’s continued growth and expansion and increasing reliance on third party service providers could adversely affect its internal control over financial reporting which could harm its business and financial results 

clorox management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the company’s transactions providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management’s authorization and providing reasonable assurance that the unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the company’s financial statements would be prevented or detected the company’s continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets will place significant additional pressure on the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting moreover the company increasingly engages the services of third parties to assist with business operations and financial reporting processes which inserts additional monitoring obligations and risk into the system of internal control any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the company’s ability to report its financial results accurately and on a timely basis or to detect and prevent fraud

patents and trademarks most of the company’s brand name consumer products are protected by registered trademarks its brand names and trademarks are highly important to its business and the company pursues a course of vigorous action against apparent infringements maintenance of brand equity value is critical to the company’s success the company’s patent rights are also material to its business and are asserted where appropriate against apparent infringements 

seasonality most sales of the company’s charcoal briquets and to a lesser extent food and autocare product lines occur in the first six months of each calendar year operating cash flow is used to build inventories of those products in the offseason 

customers and order backlog in each of fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 net sales to the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its domestic and international affiliates were 26 of the company’s total consolidated net sales order backlog is not a significant factor in the company’s business 

competition the markets for consumer products are highly competitive most of the company’s products compete with other nationally advertised brands within each category and with “private label” brands and “generic” nonbranded products of grocery chains and wholesale cooperatives in certain categories competition is encountered from similar and alternative products some of which are produced and marketed by major multinational or national companies having financial resources greater than those of the company depending on the product the company’s products compete on product performance brand recognition price quality or other benefits to consumers a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising support if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risks and uncertainties as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report or in other filings by the company with the sec could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the company or that are not currently believed by the company to be material may also harm the company’s business operations and financial results 

the company’s operating results and net earnings may not meet expectations 

the company cannot be certain that its operating results and net earnings will meet its expectations if the company’s assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition or if the company does not achieve all of its key goals then its actual performance could vary materially from its expectations the company’s operating results and net earnings may be influenced by a number of factors including the following 

 

 

in addition sales volume growth whether due to acquisitions or to internal growth can place burdens on management resources and financial controls that in turn can have a negative impact on operating results and net earnings to some extent the company sets its expense levels in anticipation of future revenues if actual revenue falls short of these expectations operating results and net earnings are likely to be adversely affected 

the company faces intense competition in its markets which could lead to reduced profitability 

the company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the us and in its international markets most of the company’s products compete with other widelyadvertised brands within each product category and with “private label” brands and “generic” nonbranded products of grocery chains and wholesale cooperatives in certain categories which typically are sold at lower prices the company also encounters competition from similar and alternative products many of which are produced and marketed by major multinational or national companies 

the company’s products generally compete on the basis of product performance brand recognition price quality or other benefits to consumers advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on consumer purchasing decisions a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position 

some of the company’s competitors are larger and have financial resources greater than those of the company these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the company can in addition the company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the company competitive activity may require the company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions or reduce prices and could lead to reduced profits and could adversely affect growth 

volume growth may be difficult to achieve 

a large percentage of the company’s revenues come from mature markets that are subject to increased competition during fiscal year 2007 approximately 82 of the company’s net sales were generated in us markets us markets for household products are considered mature and are generally characterized by high household penetration the company’s ability to achieve volume growth will depend on its ability to drive growth through innovation and investment in its established brands and its ability to capture market share from competitors in addition price increases may slow volume growth or create declines in volume in the short term as consumers adjust to price increases if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines or develop innovation to grow its product categories or develop acquire or successfully launch new products it may not achieve its volume growth objectives 

price increases in raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies or services could harm the company’s profits 

significant increases in the cost of raw materials including resin chloralkali linerboard soybean oil solvent and other miscellaneous chemicals or increases in the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services may harm the company’s profits and operating results in particular during fiscal years 2006 and 2005 the company experienced unprecedented levels of price increases for certain of its raw materials and diesel fuel and energy costs primarily as a result of supply interruptions caused by hurricanes katrina and rita and strong demand versus available supply this challenging commodity environment continued through fiscal year 2007 and the company also experienced increases in agricultural commodity prices in fiscal year 2007 if price increases for any of the primary raw materials or other necessary supplies or services occur and the company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset such price increases its profits and operating results may be harmed in addition if the company increases the prices of its product in response to increases in commodities costs and the commodity costs decline the company may not be able to sustain its price increases 

in addition in some cases the company relies on a limited number of suppliers or sole suppliers for its raw materials or other necessary supplies if the company is unable to maintain supplier arrangements and relations or if it is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity and quality levels needed for its business it could experience disruptions in production and its financial results could be adversely affected for further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices see “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on pages 14 and 15 of exhibit 991 hereto incorporated herein by reference 

the company may not successfully develop and introduce new products and line extensions 

the company’s future performance and growth depends on its ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and line extensions the company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve those goals the development and introduction of new products requires substantial and effective research development and marketing expenditures which the company may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance new product development and marketing efforts have inherent risks including product development or launch delays which could result in the company not being first to market the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance and the cost of failed product introductions 

loss of a significant customer could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the company’s net sales the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its domestic and international affiliated companies accounted for approximately 26 of the company’s net sales during fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 during fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 the company’s five largest customers accounted for 42 41 and 40 of its total consolidated net sales respectively the company expects that a significant portion of its revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers and that these percentages may increase if the growth of mass merchandisers continues as a result changes in the strategies of the company’s largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to “privatelabel” or competitors’ products may harm the company’s sales in addition the company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders and the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its customers accordingly these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the company at any time and for any reason if the company ceases doing business with a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease the company’s business financial condition and results of operations would be harmed 

failure to effectively respond to customer demands could adversely affect the company’s margins and results of operations 

in recent years the company experienced a consumer purchasing trend away from traditional grocers and toward mass merchandisers which include super centers and dollar and club stores this trend resulted in the increased size and influence of these mass merchandisers who may demand lower pricing or special packaging or impose other requirements on product suppliers these business demands may relate to inventory practices logistics or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship if the company does not effectively respond to the demands of these mass merchandisers as well as to those of traditional grocers they could decrease their purchases from the company causing the company’s sales and profits to decline 

acquisitions and new venture investments may not be successful 

in connection with the company’s centennial strategy it may seek to increase growth through acquisitions not only is the identification of good acquisition candidates difficult and competitive but these transactions also involve numerous risks including the ability to 

 

companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities andor amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition in addition to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the company’s acquisitions diminish in the future the company may be required to record additional writedowns of goodwill intangible assets or other assets associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect its operating results 

in addition any future new venture investments may not be successful in fiscal year 2008 the company will terminate certain new venture investments resulting in charges related to the writedown of such investments for additional information see “restructuring and asset impairment costs” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on pages 5 and 6 of exhibit 991 hereto incorporated herein by reference 

operations outside the united states expose the company to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets 

the company’s sales outside the united states were approximately 18 of net sales in fiscal year 2007 and its strategy includes expanding its international business as of june 30 2007 the company owned and operated 21 manufacturing facilities outside the united states the company has and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations including 

 

these risks could have a significant impact on the company’s ability to sell its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position the company’s small volume in some countries relative to some multinational and local competitors could exacerbate such risks 

also the company’s operations outside the united states are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences 

the company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar although the company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks it is not fully protected against foreign currency fluctuations and its reported earnings will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 

the share exchange with henkel kgaa henkel could result in significant tax liability 

on november 22 2004 the company completed the exchange of its ownership interest in a subsidiary for henkel’s approximately 614 million shares of the company’s common stock which represented approximately 29 of the company’s common stock prior to the exchange at the time of the share exchange with henkel the company received an opinion from its special tax counsel to the effect that among other things the share exchange should qualify as a taxfree distribution under section 355 of the internal revenue code the “code” and that the company should recognize no gain or loss upon the distribution of its subsidiary’s stock to henkel for us federal income tax purposes in addition at the time of the share exchange henkel received an opinion from its special tax counsel to the effect that among other things the share exchange of the subsidiary’s stock to henkel should qualify as a taxfree distribution under section 355 of the code for us federal income tax purposes these opinions were based in part upon various factual representations that henkel and the company made the company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause such representations to be untrue or incomplete in any material respect nonetheless the company cannot be certain that the share exchange will qualify for taxfree treatment to it or to henkel the company did not apply for an advance tax ruling from the internal revenue service the “irs” with respect to the us federal income tax consequences of the share exchange opinions of counsel are not binding on the irs and the conclusions expressed in the opinions could be challenged by the irs 

in general the company agreed to be responsible for henkel’s taxes on the transaction if the company’s actions result in a breach of the representations and warranties in a manner that causes the share exchange to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment henkel agreed to similar obligations it is expected that the amount of any such taxes to henkel and to the company would be substantial although certain of the taxes described above would be imposed on henkel the company would in certain circumstances be liable for all or a portion of such taxes see “risk factors–if the share exchange with henkel is treated as a taxable transaction and the company is required to indemnify henkel for certain tax liabilities pursuant to the tax matters agreement it could materially affect the company’s liquidity” 

if the share exchange with henkel is treated as a taxable transaction and the company is required to indemnify henkel for certain tax liabilities pursuant to the tax matters agreement it could materially affect the company’s liquidity 

in general pursuant to the tax matters agreement that the company entered into with henkel in connection with the share exchange the company agreed to be responsible for any taxes including the taxes of henkel that result from certain of the company’s actions or that result from the company’s breach of a representation or a covenant that it has given in connection with the tax opinion delivered to the company by its special tax counsel and the tax opinion delivered to henkel by its special tax counsel described above in a manner that causes the share exchange to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code henkel has agreed to similar obligations in the tax matters agreement the company’s indemnification obligations to henkel are not limited in amount or subject to any cap if the company is required to indemnify henkel under the circumstances set forth in the tax matters agreement it may be subject to substantial liabilities that may materially affect its liquidity and therefore its ability to service the senior notes it issued in connection with the share exchange 

resolutions of tax disputes may impact the company’s earnings and cash flow 

significant judgment is required in determining the company’s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions the company establishes accruals for certain tax contingencies when despite the belief that its tax return positions are fully supported it believes that certain positions will be challenged and that its positions may not be fully sustained the taxcontingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law development and emerging legislation the company’s effective tax rate includes the impact of taxcontingency accruals and changes to the accruals including related interest and penalties as considered appropriate by management when particular matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the company’s effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 

the irs has completed audits of the company’s income tax returns through the fiscal year ended june 30 2002 in april 2005 the company announced an agreement with the irs resolving certain tax issues arising in the period from 1997 through 2000 as a result the company paid federal and state taxes and interest of 94 million and 151 million during fiscal years 2005 and 2006 respectively these payments negatively impacted the company’s cash flows the company had previously accrued for this contingency and released taxcontingency accruals associated with this settlement in the third quarter of fiscal year 2005 in june 2007 the company settled remaining federal tax issues in its fiscal 1997 through 2000 tax years the company is in the process of negotiating tax issues for the fiscal year 20012002 period and has settled or is near settlement of most of the significant tax issues in that period resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material impact on earnings or cash flow for additional information refer to the information set forth in note 19 – income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 48 of exhibit 991 hereto incorporated herein by reference 

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of financial accounting standards board statement no 109  for additional information refer to the information set forth in “new accounting pronouncements” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” beginning on page 15 of exhibit 991 hereto incorporated herein by reference 

government regulations could impose material costs 

generally the manufacture packaging labeling storage distribution and advertising of the company’s products and the conduct of its business operations must all comply with extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations for example in the united states many of the company’s products are regulated by the environmental protection agency the food and drug administration and the consumer product safety commission and the company’s product claims and advertising are regulated by the federal trade commission in addition security at certain of our facilities is regulated by the department of homeland security most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies in addition the company’s international operations are subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products during the past two years the company experienced an increase in the number of regulatory inspections at its facilities in the us if the company is found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas it could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent the company from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results particularly with respect to its charcoal business it is possible that the federal government will increase regulation of the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to enhance homeland security or protect the environment and that such regulation could negatively impact the company’s ability to obtain raw material or increase costs 

product liability claims could adversely affect the company’s sales and operating results 

the company may be required to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products claims could be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s sales and operating results in addition if one of the company’s products is found to be defective the company could be required to recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or certain product liability claims may be excluded under the terms of the policy 

environmental matters create potential liability risks 

the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to air emissions water discharges the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances the company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its currently and formerly owned and leased facilities in addition some of its present and former facilities have been or had been in operation for many years and over that time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that those sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom the company has sent waste may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation it is possible that the company could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 

at june 30 2007 the company had a recorded liability of 23 million for its future remediation costs one matter in dickinson county michigan for which the company is jointly and severally liable accounts for a substantial majority of the recorded liability the company is subject to a costsharing arrangement with another party for this matter and the company has agreed to be liable for 243 of the aggregate remediation and associated costs other than legal fees as it and the other party are each responsible for their own such fees the other party in this matter reported a substantial net loss for calendar year 2006 if the other party with whom the company shares joint and several liability is unable to pay its share of the response and remediation obligations the company would likely be responsible for such obligations in october 2004 the company and the other party agreed to a consent judgment with the michigan department of environmental quality which sets forth certain remediation goals and monitoring activities based on the current status of this matter and with the assistance of environmental consultants the company maintains an undiscounted liability representing its best estimate of its share of costs associated with the capital expenditures maintenance and other costs to be incurred over an estimated 30year remediation period the most significant components of the liability relate to the estimated costs associated with the remediation of groundwater contamination and excess levels of subterranean methane deposits currently the company cannot accurately predict the timing of the payments that will likely be made under this estimated obligation in addition the estimated loss exposure is sensitive to a variety of uncertain factors including the efficacy of remediation efforts changes in remediation requirements and the timing varying costs and alternative cleanup technologies that may become available in the future although it is possible that the company’s exposure may exceed the amount recorded any amount of such additional exposures or range of exposures is not estimable at this time 

the company also handles andor transports hazardous substances including but not limited to chlorine at its plant sites including the rail transit of liquid chlorine from its point of origin to our manufacturing facilities a release of such chemicals whether in transit or at our facilities due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability the company has incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations 

failure to maximize or to successfully assert the company’s intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness 

the company relies on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property rights the company cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions the company cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future and the company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to defend its intellectual property rights in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if other parties infringe the company’s intellectual property rights they may dilute the value of its brands in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the company’s brands and harm its sales the failure to perfect or successfully assert its intellectual property rights could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

if the company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others its competitiveness could be negatively impacted 

if the company is found to have violated the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others such a finding could result in the need to cease use of a trademark trade secret copyrighted work or patented invention in the company’s business and the obligation to pay a substantial amount for past infringement it could also be necessary to pay a substantial amount in the future if the rights holders are willing to permit the company to continue to use the intellectual property rights either having to cease use or pay such amounts could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company’s substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its operations and financial results and prevent the company from fulfilling its obligations 

the company has a significant amount of indebtedness as of june 30 2007 the company had 20 billion of debt in august 2007 the company incurred additional debt in connection with its accelerated share repurchase program which it financed through its existing cash flows and the issuance of commercial paper 

the company’s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

 

the company may not have sufficient cash to service its indebtedness and pay cash dividends 

the company’s ability to make payments on and to refinance its indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts will depend on its ability to generate cash in the future in addition the company’s ability to pay cash dividends will depend on its ability to generate cash and net profits as defined by delaware law the ability to generate cash and net profits to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond the company’s control 

the company may incur substantially more debt which could further exacerbate the risks described above 

the company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions to repurchase shares or to fund other activities for general business purposes as of june 30 2007 approximately 13 billion was available to borrow under the company’s 13 billion revolving credit facility in august 2007 the company incurred additional debt in connection with its accelerated share repurchase program which it financed through its existing cash flows and the issuance of commercial paper if new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that the company now faces could intensify in addition the cost of incurring additional debt could increase due to possible additional downgrades in the company’s credit rating 

the company’s manufacturing and other facilities may be subject to disruption from events beyond the company’s control 

operations at the company’s manufacturing facilities may be subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism pandemics fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters in addition the company’s corporate headquarters and technical center are located near major earthquake fault lines in california if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment temporary loss of access to critical data delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations 

failure to meet market expectations could impact the company’s stock price 

the market price for the company’s stock is based in part on market expectations for the company’s sales growth earning per share and cash flow failure to meet these expectations could cause the market price of the company’s stock to decline rapidly and sharply 

the company’s continued growth and expansion could adversely affect its internal control over financial reporting which could harm its business and financial results 

clorox management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the company’s transactions providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management’s authorization and providing reasonable assurance that the unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the company’s financial statements would be prevented or detected the company’s continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets will place significant additional pressure on the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the company’s ability to report its financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud

sources and availability of raw materials the company purchases raw materials packaging supplies and energy from numerous unaffiliated firms some of which are sole suppliers interruptions in the delivery of these materials or services could adversely impact the company significant raw materials were available from a sufficient number of sources during fiscal year 2006 although costs were significantly higher than prioryear levels the company utilizes supply and forwardpurchase contracts to ensure availability of raw material supply at the quantity and quality standards needed in its operations the company is exposed to changes in the price of commodities used as raw materials in the manufacturing of its products for further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices see “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” in “management’s discussion and analysis” on pages 13 through 14 of exhibit 991 hereto and “risk factors – price increases in raw materials could harm the company’s profits” in item 1a 

patents and trademarks most of the company’s brand name consumer products are protected by registered trademarks its brand names and trademarks are highly important to its business and the company pursues a course of vigorous action against apparent infringements maintenance of brand equity value is critical to the company’s success the company’s patent rights are also material to its business and are asserted where appropriate against apparent infringements 

seasonality most sales of the company’s charcoal briquets and foods product lines occur in the first six months of each calendar year operating cash flow is used to build inventories of those products in the offseason 

customers and order backlog during fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 net sales to the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its domestic and international affiliates were 26 26 and 25 respectively of the company’s consolidated net sales order backlog is not a significant factor in the company’s business 

competition the markets for consumer products are highly competitive most of the company’s products compete with other nationally advertised brands within each category and with “private label” brands and “generic” nonbranded products of grocery chains and wholesale cooperatives in certain categories competition is encountered from similar and alternative products some of which are produced and marketed by major multinational or national companies having financial resources greater than those of the company depending on the product the company’s products compete on product performance brand recognition price quality or other benefits to consumers a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising support if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risks and uncertainties as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report or in other filings by the company with the sec could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to the company or that are not currently believed by the company to be material may also harm the company’s business operations and financial results 

operating results and net earnings may not meet expectations 

the company cannot be certain that its operating results and net earnings will meet its expectations if the company’s assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition or if the company does not achieve all of its key goals then its actual performance could vary materially from its expectations the company’s operating results and net earnings may be influenced by a number of factors including the following 

 

 

in addition sales volume growth whether due to acquisitions or to internal growth can place burdens on management resources and financial controls that in turn can have a negative impact on operating results and net earnings to some extent the company sets its expense levels in anticipation of future revenues if actual revenue falls short of these expectations operating results and net earnings are likely to be adversely affected 

the company faces intense competition in its markets 

the company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the us and in its international markets most of the company’s products compete with other widely advertised brands within each product category and with “private label” brands and “generic” nonbranded products of grocery chains and wholesale cooperatives in certain categories which typically are sold at lower prices the company also encounters competition from similar and alternative products many of which are produced and marketed by major multinational or national companies 

the company’s products generally compete on the basis of product performance brand recognition price quality or other benefits to consumers advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on consumer purchasing decisions 

a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position some of the company’s competitors are larger and have financial resources greater than those of the company these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the company can in addition the company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the company competitive pricing may require the company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions or reduce prices and could lead to a reduction in its sales or its profits 

volume growth may be difficult to achieve 

a large percentage of the company’s revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to increased competition during fiscal year 2006 approximately 84 of the company’s net sales were generated in us markets us markets for household products are considered mature and are generally characterized by high household penetration the company’s ability to achieve volume growth will depend on its ability to drive growth through innovation and investment in its established brands and its ability to capture market share from competitors during fiscal year 2006 the company increased prices on more than 50 of its product portfolio price increases may slow volume growth or create declines in volume in the short term as consumers adjust to price increases if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines or bring innovation to grow its product categories or develop acquire or successfully launch new products it may not achieve its volume growth objectives 

the growth of the company’s business depends on continuous and successful new product introductions 

in most categories in which the company competes there are frequent introductions of new products and line extensions important factors in the company’s future performance will be its ability to identify emerging consumer and technological trends and maintain and improve the competitiveness of its product offerings the company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve those goals the development and introduction of new products requires substantial and effective research development and marketing expenditures which the company may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance new product development and marketing efforts have inherent risks including product development or launch delays which could result in the company not being first to market the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance and the cost of failed product introductions 

the company depends on a limited number of customers for a large portion of its net sales 

a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the company’s net sales the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its domestic and international affiliated companies accounted for approximately 26 of the company’s net sales during fiscal years 2006 and 2005 and 25 of net sales in fiscal year 2004 during fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 the company’s five largest customers accounted for 41 40 and 40 of its net sales respectively the company expects that a significant portion of its revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers and that these percentages may increase if the growth of mass merchandisers continues as a result changes in the strategies of the company’s largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to privatelabel or competitors’ products may harm the company’s sales in addition the company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders and the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its customers accordingly these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the company at any time and for any reason if the company loses a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease it may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

large sophisticated customers may take actions that adversely affect the company’s margins and results of operations 

in recent years the company has experienced a consumer purchasing trend away from traditional grocers and toward mass merchandisers which include super centers and dollar and club stores this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of these mass merchandisers who may demand lower pricing or special packaging or impose other requirements on product suppliers these business demands may relate to inventory practices logistics or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship if the company does not effectively respond to the demands of these mass merchandisers they could decrease their purchases from the company causing the company’s sales and profitability to decline 

price increases in raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies or services could harm the company’s profits 

increases in the cost of raw materials including resin chloralkali linerboard soy bean oil solvent and other miscellaneous chemicals or increases in the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services may harm the company’s profits and operating results in particular during fiscal years 2005 and 2006 the company experienced unprecedented levels of price increases for certain of its raw materials and diesel fuel and energy costs primarily as a result of supply interruptions caused by hurricanes katrina and rita and strong demand from abroad if price increases in any of the primary raw materials or other necessary supplies or services occur and the company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset the increase in prices its profits and operating results may be harmed in addition in some cases the company relies on a limited number of suppliers or sole suppliers for its raw materials or other necessary supplies if the company is unable to maintain supplier arrangements and relations or if it is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity and quality levels need for its business it could experience disruptions in production and its financial results could be adversely affected for further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices see “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” in “management’s discussion and analysis” on pages 13 through 14 of exhibit 991 hereto incorporated herein by reference 

operations outside the united states expose the company to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets 

the company’s sales outside the united states were approximately 16 of net sales in fiscal year 2006 and the company owns and operates 21 manufacturing facilities outside the united states the company has and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations including 

 

these risks could have a significant impact on the company’s ability to sell its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position the company’s small volume in some countries relative to some multinational and local competitors could exacerbate such risks 

also the company’s operations outside the united states are subject to the risk of new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences 

the company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its sales profits and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar although the company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks it is not fully protected against foreign currency fluctuations and its reported earnings will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 

the share exchange with henkel could result in significant tax liability 

on november 22 2004 the company completed the exchange of its ownership interest in a subsidiary for henkel’s approximately 614 million shares of the company’s common stock which represented approximately 29 of the company’s common stock prior to the exchange at the time of the share exchange with henkel the company received an opinion from its special tax counsel to the effect that among other things the share exchange should qualify as a taxfree distribution under section 355 of the internal revenue code the “code” and that the company should recognize no gain or loss upon the distribution of its subsidiary’s stock to henkel for us federal income tax purposes in addition at the time of the share exchange henkel received an opinion from its special tax counsel to the effect that among other things the share exchange of the subsidiary’s stock to henkel should qualify as a taxfree distribution under section 355 of the code for us federal income tax purposes these opinions were based in part upon various factual representations that henkel and the company made the company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause such representations to be untrue or incomplete in any material respect nonetheless the company cannot be certain that the share exchange will qualify for taxfree treatment to it or to henkel the company did not apply for an advance tax ruling from the internal revenue service the “irs” with respect to the us federal income tax consequences of the share exchange opinions of counsel are not binding on the irs and the conclusions expressed in the opinions could be challenged by the irs 

in general the company agreed to be responsible for henkel’s taxes on the transaction if the company’s actions result in a breach of the representations and warranties in a manner that causes the share exchange to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment henkel agreed to similar obligations it is expected that the amount of any such taxes to henkel and to the company would be substantial although certain of the taxes described above would be imposed on henkel the company would in certain circumstances be liable for all or a portion of such taxes see “risk factors–if the share exchange with henkel is treated as a taxable transaction and the company is required to indemnify henkel for certain tax liabilities pursuant to the tax matters agreement it could materially affect the company’s liquidity” 

even if the share exchange is taxfree to henkel under section 355 of the code it could be taxable to the company if section 355e of the code applies to the share exchange section 355e of the code will apply if 50 or more of the company’s stock or its former subsidiary’s stock by vote or value is acquired by one or more persons acting pursuant to a plan or a series of related transactions that includes the share exchange the company cannot be certain that section 355e of the code will not apply to the share exchange risk of the applicability of section 355e of the code may also discourage delay or prevent a merger change of control or other strategic or capital raising transaction involving the company’s outstanding equity or issuance of new equity 

if the share exchange with henkel is treated as a taxable transaction and the company is required to indemnify henkel for certain tax liabilities pursuant to the tax matters agreement it could materially affect the company’s liquidity 

in general pursuant to the tax matters agreement that the company entered into with henkel in connection with the share exchange the company agreed to be responsible for any taxes including the taxes of henkel that result from certain of the company’s actions or that result from the company’s breach of a representation or a covenant that it has given in connection with the tax opinion delivered to the company by its special tax counsel and the tax opinion delivered to henkel by its special tax counsel described above in a manner that causes the share exchange to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code or from the application of section 355e of the code henkel has agreed to similar obligations in the tax matters agreement the company’s indemnification obligations to henkel are not limited in amount or subject to any cap if the company is required to indemnify henkel under the circumstances set forth in the tax matters agreement it may be subject to substantial liabilities that may materially affect its liquidity and therefore its ability to service the senior notes it issued in connection with the share exchange 

resolutions of tax disputes may impact the company’s earnings and cash flow 

significant judgment is required in determining the company’s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions the company establishes accruals for certain tax contingencies when despite the belief that its tax return positions are fully supported it believes that certain positions will be challenged and that its positions may not be fully sustained the taxcontingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law development and emerging legislation the company’s effective tax rate includes the 

impact of tax contingency accruals and changes to the accruals including related interest and penalties as considered appropriate by management when particular matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the company’s effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 

the irs has completed audits of the company’s income tax returns through the fiscal year ended june 30 2002 in april 2005 the company announced an agreement with the irs resolving certain tax issues arising in the period from 1997 through 2000 as a result the company paid federal and state taxes and interest of 94 million and 151 million during fiscal years 2005 and 2006 respectively these payments negatively impacted the company’s cash flows the company had previously accrued for this contingency and released taxcontingency accruals associated with this settlement in the third quarter of fiscal year 2005 additional tax matters through fiscal year 2002 are now being reviewed at the irs appeals level resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material impact on earnings or cash flow for additional information refer to the information set forth under the caption “contingencies” in “management’s discussion and analysis” beginning on page 12 of exhibit 991 hereto incorporated herein by reference 

identification of good acquisition candidates or jointventure partners may be difficult and integration and management of acquisitions may not be successful 

one of the elements of the company’s growth plan is to look at the possibility of increasing its sales volumes earnings and the markets it serves through acquisitions of or joint ventures with other businesses in the united states and international markets not only is the identification of good acquisition or jointventure candidates difficult and competitive but these transactions also involve numerous risks including the following 

 

in addition companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities andor amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition in addition to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the company’s acquisitions diminish in the future the company may be required to record additional writedowns of goodwill intangible assets or other assets associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect its operating results 

government regulations could impose material costs 

generally the manufacture packaging labeling storage distribution and advertising of the company’s products and the conduct of its business operations must all comply with extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations for example in the united states many of the company’s products are regulated by the environmental protection agency the food and drug administration and the consumer product safety commission and the company’s product claims and advertising are regulated by the federal trade commission most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies in addition the company’s international operations are subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products during the past two years the company experienced an increase in the number of regulatory inspections at its facilities in the us if the company is found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas it could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent the company from meeting current product demand introducing new products 

building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results particularly with respect to its charcoal business it is possible that the federal government will increase regulation of the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to enhance homeland security or protect the environment and that such regulation could negatively impact supplies of raw material or costs 

product liability claims could adversely affect the company’s sales and operating results 

the company may be required to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products claims could be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s sales and operating results in addition if one of the company’s products is found to be defective the company could be required to recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or potential product liability claims may be excluded under the terms of the policy 

environmental matters create potential liability risks 

the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to air emissions water discharges the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances the company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its currently and formerly owned and leased facilities in addition some of its present and former facilities have been or had been in operation for many years and over that time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that those sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which the company has sent waste may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation it is possible that the company could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 

at june 30 2006 the company had a recorded liability of 27 million for its future remediation costs one matter in dickinson county michigan for which the company is jointly and severally liable accounts for a substantial majority of the recorded liability the company is subject to a costsharing arrangement with another party for this matter and the company has agreed to be liable for 243 of the aggregate remediation and associated costs other than legal fees as it and the other party are each responsible for their own such fees if the other party with whom the company shares joint and several liability is unable to pay its share of the response and remediation obligations the company would likely be responsible for such obligations in october 2004 the company and the other party agreed to a consent judgment with the michigan department of environmental quality which sets forth certain remediation goals and monitoring activities based on the current status of this matter and with the assistance of environmental consultants the company maintains an undiscounted liability representing its best estimate of its share of costs associated with the capital expenditures maintenance and other costs to be incurred over an estimated 30year remediation period the most significant components of the liability relate to the estimated costs associated with the remediation of groundwater contamination and excess levels of subterranean methane deposits currently the company cannot accurately predict the timing of the payments that will likely be made under this estimated obligation in addition the estimated loss exposure is sensitive to a variety of uncertain factors including the efficacy of remediation efforts changes in remediation requirements and the timing varying costs and alternative cleanup technologies that may become available in the future although it is possible that the company’s exposure may exceed the amount recorded any amount of such additional exposures or range of exposures is not estimable at this time 

the company also handles andor transports hazardous substances including but not limited to chlorine at its plant sites including the rail transit of liquid chlorine from its point of origin to our manufacturing facilities a release of such chemicals whether in transit or at our facilities due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability the company has incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations 

failure to maximize or to successfully assert the company’s intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness 

the company relies on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property rights the company cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions the company cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future and the company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to defend its intellectual property rights in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if other parties infringe the company’s intellectual property rights they may dilute the value of its brands in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the company’s brands and harm its sales the failure to perfect or successfully assert its intellectual property rights could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

if the company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others it could impact its competitiveness 

it is possible that the company will be found to have violated the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others such a finding could result in the need to cease use of a trademark trade secret copyrighted work or patented invention in the company’s business and to pay a substantial amount for past infringement it could also be necessary to pay a substantial amount in the future if the rights holder is willing to permit the company to continue to use the intellectual property rights either having to cease use or pay such amounts could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company’s substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its operations and financial results and prevent the company from fulfilling its obligations 

the company has a significant amount of indebtedness as of june 30 2006 the company had 20 billion of longterm debt 

the company’s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

 

to service its indebtedness and pay cash dividends the company will require a significant amount of cash the company’s ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond its control in addition to pay cash dividends the company must have net profits as defined by delaware law 

the company’s ability to make payments on and to refinance its indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts will depend on its ability to generate cash in the future in addition the company’s ability to pay cash dividends will depend on its ability to generate cash and net profits the ability to 

generate cash and net profits to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond the company’s control 

the company may still be able to incur substantially more debt which could further exacerbate the risks described above 

the company may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future as of june 30 2006 approximately 13 billion was available to borrow under the company’s 13 billion revolving credit facility if new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that the company now faces could intensify 

the company may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

much of the company’s future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including members of the executive team and those in technical marketing and staff positions during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 the company announced that gerald e johnston its chairman and chief executive officer was retiring from his positions and that the board of directors with the assistance of an executive search firm would conduct an internal and external search for a new chief executive officer experienced personnel including executives in the company’s industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in the san francisco bay area where the company’s corporate headquarters and many of its employees are located although the company strives to be an employer of choice it may not be able to successfully attract and retain key personnel which would cause its business to suffer 

the company’s manufacturing and other facilities may be subject to disruption from work stoppages terrorism or natural disasters 

operations at the company’s manufacturing facilities may be subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism pandemics fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters in addition the company’s corporate headquarters and technical center are located near major earthquake fault lines in california if a major disruption were to occur it could result in temporary loss of access to critical data delays in shipments of products to customers suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment 

the company may be liable for unauthorized disclosure of data 

in connection with some of the company’s customer loyalty programs and promotional programs it gathers and stores limited personal data regarding the consumers of its products these programs typically provide that the company enter into contracts which specify limits on use of this data if any person including any of the company’s employees or partners circumvents the company’s security measures they could misappropriate this data if this occurs the company could be subject to liability as a result of the security breach or misappropriation of its registered consumers’ personal data 

failure to meet market expectations could impact the company’s stock price 

the market price for the company’s stock is based in part on market expectations for the company’s sales growth earning per share and cash flow failure to meet these expectations could cause the market price of the company’s stock to decline potentially rapidly and sharply 

the company’s continued growth and expansion could adversely affect its internal control over financial reporting which could harm its business and financial results 

the management of clorox is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the company’s transactions providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management’s authorization and providing reasonable assurance that the unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the company’s financial 

statements would be prevented or detected the company’s continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets will place significant additional pressure on the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the company’s ability to report its financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud

net sales by geographic area 

   

longlived assets at june 30 

   

sources and availability of raw materials the company purchases raw materials packaging supplies transportation and other services products and energy from numerous unaffiliated firms interruptions in the delivery of these materials or services could adversely impact the company significant raw materials were available from a sufficient number of sources during fiscal year 2005 the company is exposed to changes in the price of commodities used as raw materials in the manufacturing of its products for further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices see “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” in “management’s discussion and analysis” on pages 16 through 17 of exhibit 991 hereto incorporated herein by reference

seasonality most sales of the company’s charcoal briquets foods and auto appearance product lines occur in the first six months of each calendar year operating cash flow is used to build inventories of those products in the offseason

renegotiation none of the company’s operations is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of the federal government

competition the markets for consumer products are highly competitive most of the company’s products compete with other nationally advertised brands within each category and with “private label” brands and “generic” nonbranded products of grocery chains and wholesale cooperatives competition is encountered from similar and alternative products some of which are produced and marketed by major multinational or national concerns having financial resources greater than those of the company depending on the product the company’s products compete on price quality or other benefits to consumers a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising and sales promotion if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continuing advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position

research and development the company incurred expenses of approximately 88 million 84 million and 75 million in fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively on research activities relating to the development of new products or the maintenance and improvement of existing products none of this research activity was customersponsored

number of persons employed at the end of fiscal year 2005 the company employed approximately 7600 people

risk factors 

the company faces intense competition in its markets 

the company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the us and in its international markets most of the company’s products compete with other widely advertised brands within each product category and with “private label” brands and “generic” nonbranded products of grocery chains and wholesale cooperatives which typically are sold at lower prices the company also encounters competition from similar and alternative products many of which are produced and marketed by major multinational or national concerns the company’s products generally compete on the basis of price quality or other benefits to consumers advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on consumer purchasing decisions 

a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising and sales promotion if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continuing advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position some of the company’s competitors are larger and have financial resources greater than those of the company and may therefore be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the company can in addition the company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the company competitive pricing may require the company to reduce prices and could lead to a reduction in its sales or its profit margins 

volume growth may be difficult to achieve 

a large percentage of the company’s revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to increased competition during fiscal year 2005 approximately 84 of the company’s net sales were generated in us markets us markets for household products are considered mature and are generally characterized by high household penetration the company’s ability to achieve volume growth will depend on its ability to drive growth through innovation and investment in its established brands and its ability to capture market share from competitors if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines or bring innovation to grow the categories or develop acquire or successfully launch new products it may not achieve its growth objectives 

the company’s financial performance depends on continuous and successful new product introductions 

in most categories in which the company competes there are frequent introductions of new products and line extensions an important factor in the company’s future performance will be its ability to identify emerging consumer and technological trends and to maintain and improve the competitiveness of its products the company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve those goals the development 

and introduction of new products requires substantial and effective research development and marketing expenditures which the company may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance continued product development and marketing efforts have inherent risks including product development or launch delays the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance and the cost of failed product introductions 

operating results and net earnings may not meet expectations 

the company cannot be certain that its operating results and net earnings will meet its expectations if the company’s assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition or if the company does not achieve all of its key goals then its actual performance could vary materially from its expectations the company’s operating results and net earnings may be influenced by a number of factors including the following 

·   the introduction of new products and line extensions by the company or its competitors

·   the mix of products with varying profitability sold in a given quarter

·   the company’s ability to control internal costs

·   the effectiveness of the company’s advertising marketing and promotional programs

·   changes in product pricing policies by the company or its competitors

·   the ability of the company to maintain and enhance profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment

·   the ability of the company to successfully implement and achieve the expected benefits of its process improvement initiatives

·   the ability of the company to achieve its business plans including volume growth and pricing plans as a result of high levels of competitive activity

·   the ability to maintain key retail customer relationships

·   the potential inability to generate expected cost savings and efficiencies from the company’s enterprise resource planning and customer relationship data processing systems

·   the potential inability to generate expected cost savings and efficiencies from restructuring the company’s supply chain

·   the ability of major customers and other debtors to meet their obligations as they come due

·   the failure of parties contracting with the company to perform their obligations and the loss of or inability to renew contracts of importance to the company’s performance

in addition sales volume growth whether due to acquisitions or to internal growth can place burdens on management resources and financial controls that in turn can have a negative impact on operating results and net earnings to some extent the company sets its expense levels in anticipation of future revenues if actual revenue falls short of these expectations operating results and net earnings are likely to be adversely affected 

the company depends on a limited number of customers for a large portion of its net sales 

a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the company’s net sales the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliated companies accounted for approximately 27 of the company’s net sales during fiscal year 2005 and 25 of net sales in each of fiscal years 2004 and 2003 during fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 the company’s five largest customers accounted for 41 39 and 39 of its net sales respectively the company expects that a significant portion of its revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers and that these percentages may increase if the growth of mass merchandisers continues as a result changes in the strategies of the company’s largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private label products may harm the company’s sales in addition the company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders and the company typically does not enter into longterm contracts with its customers accordingly these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the company at any time and for any reason if the company loses a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease it may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

large sophisticated customers may take actions that adversely affect the company’s margins and results of operations 

in recent years the company has experienced a consumer trend away from traditional grocers and toward mass merchandisers which include super centers and club stores this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of these mass merchandisers as these mass merchandisers grow larger and become more sophisticated they may demand lower pricing special packaging or impose other requirements on product suppliers these business demands may relate to inventory practices logistics or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship if the company does not effectively respond to the demands of these mass merchandisers they could decrease their purchases from the company causing the company’s sales and profitability to decline 

operations outside the united states expose the company to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets 

the company’s sales outside the united states were approximately 16 of net sales in fiscal year 2005 and the company owns and operates 21 manufacturing facilities outside the united states the company has and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations including 

·   economic or political instability in its international markets

·   restrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the united states and

·   the imposition of tariffs or trade restrictions

the company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its sales profits and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar although the company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks it is not fully protected against foreign currency fluctuations and its reported earnings will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 

as a result of these factors the company took substantial impairment charges related to its international operations in fiscal years 2003 and 2002 and due to uncertainties and possible deterioration in the overseas markets it may have to take additional charges in the future in addition these risks could have a significant impact on the company’s ability to sell its products on a timely and competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position the company’s small volume in some countries relative to some multinational and local competitors could exacerbate such risks also the company’s operations outside the united states are subject to the risk of new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences 

the share exchange with henkel could result in significant tax liability 

on november 22 2004 the company completed the exchange of its ownership interest in a subsidiary for henkel’s approximately 614 million shares of the company’s common stock which represented approximately 29 of the company’s common stock prior to the exchange at the time of the share exchange with henkel the company received an opinion from its special tax counsel to the effect that among other things the share exchange should qualify as a taxfree distribution under section 355 of the internal revenue code the “code” and that the company should recognize no gain or loss upon the distribution of its subsidiary’s stock to henkel for us federal income tax purposes in addition at the time of the share exchange henkel received an opinion from its special tax counsel to the effect that among other things the share exchange of the subsidiary’s stock to henkel should qualify as a taxfree distribution under section 355 of the code for us federal income tax purposes these opinions are based in part upon various factual representations that henkel and the company have made the company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause such representations to be untrue or incomplete 

in any material respect nonetheless the company cannot be certain that the share exchange will qualify for taxfree treatment to it or to henkel the company has not applied for an advance tax ruling from the internal revenue service the “irs” with respect to the us federal income tax consequences of the share exchange opinions of counsel are not binding on the irs and the conclusions expressed in the opinions could be challenged by the irs 

if the share exchange does not qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes under section 355 of the code then in general the company would be subject to tax as if it had sold the common stock of its subsidiary in a taxable sale for its fair market value henkel would be subject to tax as if it had sold the clorox stock that it exchanged in a taxable sale for the value of the stock of the subsidiary it acquired in the exchange it is expected that the amount of any such taxes to henkel and to the company would be substantial although certain of the taxes described above would be imposed on henkel the company would in certain circumstances be liable for all or a portion of such taxes see “—if the share exchange with henkel is treated as a taxable transaction and the company is required to indemnify henkel for certain tax liabilities pursuant to the tax matters agreement it could materially affect the company’s liquidity” 

even if the share exchange is taxfree to henkel under section 355 of the code it could be taxable to the company if section 355e of the code applies to the share exchange section 355e of the code will apply if 50 or more of the company’s stock or its former subsidiary’s stock by vote or value is acquired by one or more persons acting pursuant to a plan or a series of related transactions that includes the share exchange the company cannot be certain that section 355e of the code will not apply to the share exchange risk of the applicability of section 355e of the code may also discourage delay or prevent a merger change of control or other strategic or capital raising transaction involving the company’s outstanding equity or issuance of new equity 

if the share exchange with henkel is treated as a taxable transaction and the company is required to indemnify henkel for certain tax liabilities pursuant to the tax matters agreement it could materially affect the company’s liquidity 

in general pursuant to the tax matters agreement that the company entered into with henkel in connection with the share exchange the company agreed to be responsible for any taxes including the taxes of henkel that result from certain of the company’s actions or that result from the company’s breach of a representation or a covenant that it has given in connection with the tax opinion delivered to the company by its special tax counsel and the tax opinion delivered to henkel by its special tax counsel described above in a manner that causes the share exchange to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code or from the application of section 355e of the code henkel has agreed to similar obligations in the tax matters agreement the company’s indemnification obligations to henkel are not limited in amount or subject to any cap if the company is required to indemnify henkel under the circumstances set forth in the tax matters agreement it may be subject to substantial liabilities that may materially affect its liquidity and therefore its ability to service the senior notes it issued in connection with the share exchange 

resolutions of tax disputes may impact the company’s earnings and cash flow 

significant judgment is required in determining the company’s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions the company establishes accruals for certain tax contingencies when despite the belief that its tax return positions are fully supported it believes that certain positions will be challenged and that its positions may not be fully sustained the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law development and emerging legislation the company’s effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals and changes to the accruals including related interest and penalties as considered appropriate by management when particular 

matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the company’s effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 

the irs completed its audit of the company’s 1997 through 2000 tax returns and the audit of the 2001 and 2002 tax years is now in progress in april 2005 the company announced an agreement with the irs resolving certain tax issues arising in the period from 1997 through 2000 under which the company is paying approximately 247 million in federal and state taxes and interest the company paid 94 million during fiscal year 2005 and paid the majority of the balance approximately 150 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 these payments negatively impacted the company’s cash flows the company had previously accrued for this contingency and released taxcontingency accruals associated with this settlement in the third quarter of fiscal year 2005 for additional information refer to the information set forth under the caption “contingencies” in “management’s discussion and analysis” beginning on page 15 of exhibit 991 hereto incorporated herein by reference 

price increases in raw materials could harm the company’s profit margins 

the company utilizes several key raw materials in the production of its products including but not limited to energy resin chloralkali linerboard soy bean oil diesel solvent and other miscellaneous chemicals in some cases the company relies on a limited number of suppliers for these raw materials if price increases in any of the primary raw materials occur the company may not be able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset the increase in raw material prices which could harm its profit margins for further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices see “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” in “management’s discussion and analysis” on pages 16 through 17 of exhibit 991 hereto incorporated herein by reference 

identification of good acquisition candidates or joint venture partners may be difficult and integration and management of acquisitions may not be successful 

one of the elements of the company’s growth plan is to look at the possibility of increasing its sales volumes earnings and the markets it serves through acquisitions of or joint ventures with other businesses in the united states and international markets not only is the identification of good acquisition or joint venture candidates difficult and competitive but these transactions also involve numerous risks including the following 

·   difficulties in integrating the acquired companies products or personnel into the company’s existing business

·   difficulties in retaining key relationships with employees customers partners and suppliers of the acquired company and

·   difficulties in maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies throughout acquired companies

in addition there can be no assurance that companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created will be profitable at their inception or that they will achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities andor amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition in addition to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the company’s acquisitions diminish in the future the company may be required to record additional write downs of goodwill intangible assets or other assets associated with such acquisitions which could adversely affect its operating results 

government regulations could impose material costs 

generally the manufacture packaging labeling storage distribution and advertising of the company’s products and the conduct of its business operations must all comply with extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations for example in the united states many of the company’s products are regulated by the environmental protection agency the food and drug administration and the consumer product safety commission and the company’s product claims and advertising are regulated by the federal trade commission most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies in addition the company’s international operations are subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products during the past year the company experienced an increase in the number of regulatory inspections at its facilities in the us if the company is found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas it could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent the company from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results particularly with respect to its charcoal business it is possible that the federal government will increase regulation of the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to enhance homeland security or protect the environment and that such regulation could negatively impact raw material supply or costs 

product liability claims could adversely affect the company’s sales and operating results 

the company may be required to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products claims could be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s sales and operating results in addition if one of the company’s products is found to be defective the company could be required to recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or potential product liability claims may be excluded under the terms of the policy 

environmental matters create potential liability risks 

the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to air emissions water discharges the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances the company handles and transports hazardous substances including but not limited to chlorine at its plant sites a release of such chemicals due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities andor to third parties the company has incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations 

the company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its presently and formerly owned and leased facilities in addition some of its present and former facilities have been or had been in operation for many years and over that time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that those sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which the company has sent waste may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation it is possible that the company could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 

at june 30 2005 the company had a recorded liability of 33 million for its future remediation costs one matter in dickinson county michigan for which the company is jointly and severally liable accounts for a substantial majority of the recorded liability the company is subject to a costsharing arrangement with another party for this matter and the company has agreed to be liable for 243 of the aggregate remediation and associated costs other than legal fees as it and the other party are each responsible for their own such fees in october 2004 the company and the other party agreed to a consent judgment with the michigan department of environmental quality which sets forth certain remediation goals and monitoring activities based on the current status of this matter and with the assistance of environmental consultants the company maintains an undiscounted liability representing its best estimate of its share of costs associated with the capital expenditures maintenance and other costs to be incurred over an estimated 30year remediation period the most significant components of the liability relate to the estimated costs associated with the remediation of groundwater contamination and excess levels of subterranean methane deposits currently the company cannot accurately predict the timing of the payments that will likely be made under this estimated obligation in addition the estimated loss exposure is sensitive to a variety of uncertain factors including the efficacy of remediation efforts changes in remediation requirements and the timing varying costs and alternative cleanup technologies that may become available in the future although it is possible that the company’s exposure may exceed the amount recorded any amount of such additional exposures or range of exposures is not estimable at this time 

failure to maximize or to successfully assert the company’s intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness 

the company relies on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property rights the company cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions the company cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future and the company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to defend its intellectual property rights in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if other parties infringe the company’s intellectual property rights they may dilute the value of its brands in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the company’s brands and harm its sales the failure to perfect or successfully assert its intellectual property rights could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition 

if the company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others it could impact its competitiveness 

it is possible that the company will be found to have violated the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others such a finding could result in the need to cease use of a trademark trade secret copyrighted work or patented invention in the company’s business and to pay a substantial amount for past infringement it could also be necessary to pay a substantial amount in the future if the rights holder is willing to permit the company to continue to use the intellectual property right either having to cease use or pay such amounts could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on its business operating results and financial condition 

the company’s substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its operations and financial results and prevent the company from fulfilling its obligations 

the company has a significant amount of indebtedness as of june 30 2005 the company had approximately 21 billion of longterm debt and stockholders’ deficit of approximately 513 million 

the company’s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

·   make it more difficult for the company to satisfy its obligations

·   increase the company’s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions

·   require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness which would reduce the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital requirements capital expenditures expansion efforts and other general corporate purposes

·   limit the company’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and the industry in which it operates

·   place the company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt and

·   limit along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the company’s indebtedness among other things its ability to borrow additional funds failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could have a significant adverse effect on the company

to service its indebtedness and pay cash dividends the company will require a significant amount of cash the company’s ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond its control in addition to pay cash dividends the company must have sufficient surplus or net profits as defined by delaware law 

the company’s ability to make payments on and to refinance its indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts will depend on its ability to generate cash in the future in addition the company’s ability to pay cash dividends will depend on its ability to generate cash and net profits the ability to generate cash and net profits to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond the company’s control 

the company may still be able to incur substantially more debt which could further exacerbate the risks described above 

the company may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future as of june 30 2005 approximately 13 billion was available to borrow under the company’s 13 billion revolving credit facility if new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that the company now faces could intensify 

the company may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

much of the company’s future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including members of the executive team and those in technical marketing and staff positions experienced personnel in the company’s industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in the san francisco bay area where the company’s corporate headquarters and many of its employees are located although the company strives to be an employer of choice it may not be able to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel which would cause its business to suffer 

the company’s manufacturing and other facilities may be subject to disruption from natural disasters work stoppages or terrorism 

operations at the company’s manufacturing facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters in addition the company’s corporate headquarters and technical center are located near major earthquake fault lines in california if a major disruption were to occur it could result in temporary loss of access to critical data delays in shipments of products to customers suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment

the company may be liable for unauthorized disclosure of data 

in connection with some of the company’s customer loyalty programs and promotional programs it gathers and stores limited personal data regarding the consumers of its products these programs typically provide that the company enter into contracts which specify limits on use of this data if any person including any of the company’s employees or partners circumvents the company’s security measures they could misappropriate this data if this occurs the company could be subject to liability as a result of the security breach or misappropriation of its registered consumers’ personal data

the company’s business operations represented by the aggregate of its household products — north america specialty products and household products — latin americaother include the production and marketing of consumer products sold primarily through grocery mass merchandise club and other retail stores for the most part the factors necessary for an understanding of these three segments are essentially the same

principal markets — methods of distribution most nondurable household consumer products are nationally advertised and sold within the united states to grocery stores and grocery wholesalers primarily through a network of brokers and to mass merchandisers warehouse clubs military and other retail stores primarily through a direct sales force within the united states the company also sells institutional versions of many of its products outside the united states the company sells consumer products to the retail trade through subsidiaries licensees distributors and jointventure arrangements with local partners 

sources and availability of raw materials the company purchases raw materials packaging supplies transportation and other services products and energy from numerous unaffiliated firms interruptions in the delivery of these materials or services could adversely impact the company significant raw materials were available from a sufficient number of sources during fiscal year 2004 contingency plans have been developed for any significant raw materials sourced from a single supplier 

patents and trademarks most of the company’s brand name consumer products are protected by registered trademarks its brand names and trademarks are highly important to its business and the company pursues a course of vigorous action against apparent infringements the company’s patents patent licenses and similar arrangements are also material to its business and are defended against apparent infringements 

seasonality most sales of the company’s charcoal briquets insecticides foods and automotive appearance product lines occur in the first six months of each calendar year operating cash flow is used to build inventories of those products in the offseason the household products — north america segment does not have a significant degree of seasonality 

customers and order backlog during fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 revenues from the company’s sales of its products to walmart stores inc and its affiliated companies were 25 percent 25 percent and 23 percent respectively of the company’s consolidated net sales except for this relationship the company is not dependent upon any other single customer or group of affiliated customers order backlog is not a significant factor in the company’s business 

renegotiation none of the company’s operations is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of the federal government 

competition the markets for consumer products are highly competitive most of the company’s products compete with other nationally advertised brands within each category and with “private label” brands and “generic” nonbranded products of grocery chains and wholesale cooperatives competition is encountered from similar and alternative products many of which are produced and marketed by major national concerns having financial resources greater than those of the company depending on the product the company’s products compete on price quality or other benefits to consumers a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising and sales promotion if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continuing advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position 

research and development the company incurred expenses of approximately 84 million 76 million and 66 million in fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively on research activities relating to the development of new products or the maintenance and improvement of existing products none of this research activity was customersponsored 

environmental matters in general the company anticipates spending increasing amounts annually for facility upgrades and for environmental programs the amount of capital expenditures for environmental 

compliance was approximately 4 million in fiscal year 2004 and is not expected to be material in the next fiscal year for noncapital expenditures see the discussions of environmental matters create potential liability risks below and legal proceedings in item 3 below

forwardlooking statements and risk factors except for historical information matters discussed in this form 10k including the “management’s discussion and analysis” section and statements about future growth are forwardlooking statements based on management’s estimates assumptions and projections in addition from time to time the company may make forwardlooking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance business prospects new products research and development activities plans for international expansion acquisitions and similar matters words such as “expects” “anticipates” “targets” “goals” “projects” “intends” “plans” “believes” “seeks” “estimates” variations on such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the company’s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company’s forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are mere predictions and are uncertain the risks and uncertainties that may affect operations performance product development and results of the company’s business in a material way some of which may be beyond the control of the company include those discussed elsewhere in this form 10k marketplace conditions and events and the following 

volume growth may be difficult to achieve a large percentage of the company’s revenues come from mature markets that are subject to increased competition if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines or develop or acquire and successfully launch new products it may not achieve its growth objectives 

operating results and net earnings may not meet expectations the company cannot be sure that its operating results and net earnings will meet its expectations if the company’s assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition or if the company does not achieve all of its key goals then the company’s actual performance could vary materially from its expectations the company’s operating results and net earnings may be influenced by a number of factors including the following 

           4 

             in addition sales volume growth whether due to acquisitions or to internal growth can place burdens on the company’s management resources and financial controls that in turn can have a negative impact on operating results and net earnings to some extent the company sets its expense levels in anticipation of future revenues if actual revenue falls short of these expectations operating results and net earnings are likely to be adversely affected 

operations outside the united states expose the company to uncertain conditions in international markets the company’s sales outside the united states were 15 percent of net sales in fiscal year 2004 the company has been and will continue to be facing substantial risks associated with having foreign operations including 

  refer to the information set forth under the caption “south america economic and political conditions” in “management’s discussion and analysis” on page a11 of exhibit 991 hereto incorporated herein by reference and refer to the information set forth under the caption “marketsensitive derivatives and financial instruments” in “management’s discussion and analysis” on pages a12 and a13 of exhibit 991 hereto incorporated herein by reference 

these factors contributed to the company taking substantial impairment charges related to its international operations in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 and due to uncertainties and possible deterioration in the overseas markets the company may have to take additional charges in the future in addition these risks could have a significant impact on the company’s ability to sell its products on a timely and competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position the company’s small volume in some countries relative to some multinational and local competitors could exacerbate such risks also the company’s operations outside the united states are subject to the risk of new and different legal and 

regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences 

the potential sale of company common stock by henkel may impact financial results in december 2003 henkel kgaa “henkel” announced that it may sell some or all of its 29 stake in the company to finance it acquisition of the dial corporation pending further developments the company temporarily suspended its share repurchases in december 2003 the company is discussing with henkel its plans with respect to its interest in the company’s shares the outcome of these discussions is not known at this time if the company reacquires a portion or all of the company’s shares held by henkel the financial position and cash flows of the company could be materially impacted 

resolutions of tax disputes may impact earnings and cash flow significant judgment is required in determining the company’s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions the company establishes accruals for certain tax contingencies when despite the belief that the company’s tax return positions are fully supported the company believes that certain positions will be challenged and that the company’s positions may not be fully sustained the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law and emerging legislation the company’s effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals and changes to the accruals including related interest and penalties as considered appropriate by management when particular matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the company’s effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution for additional information refer to the information set forth under the caption “contingencies” in “management’s discussion and analysis” on page a12 of exhibit 991 hereto incorporated herein by reference 

identification of good acquisition candidates may be difficult and integration and management of acquisitions may not be successful one of the elements of the company’s growth plan is to look at the possibility of increasing its sales volumes earnings and the markets it serves through acquisitions of or joint ventures with other businesses in the united states and internationally there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify acquire or profitably manage additional companies or operations or that it will be able successfully to integrate future acquisitions into its operations or to identify negotiate and manage joint venture opportunities in addition there can be no assurance that companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created will be profitable at their inception or that they will achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made 

financial performance depends on continuous and successful new product introductions in most categories in which the company competes there are frequent introductions of new products and line extensions an important factor in the company’s future performance will be its ability to identify emerging consumer and technological trends and to maintain and improve the competitiveness of its products the company cannot be sure that it will successfully achieve those goals continued product development and marketing efforts have inherent risks including development delays the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance and the cost of failed product introductions 

government regulations could impose material costs generally the manufacture packaging labeling storage and distribution of the company’s products and the conduct of the company’s business operations must all comply with extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations for example in the united states many of the company’s products are regulated by the environmental protection agency the food and drug administration and the consumer product safety commission most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas could subject the company to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent the company from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results particularly with respect to the company’s charcoal business it is possible that the government will increase regulation of the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to enhance homeland security or protect the environment and that such regulation could negatively impact raw material supply or costs 

environmental matters create potential liability risks the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to air emissions water discharges the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances the company handles hazardous chemicals in quantity at its plant sites a release of such chemicals due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability for the company to governmental authorities or to third parties the company has incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations the company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its presently and formerly owned and leased facilities in addition some of the company’s present and former facilities have been or had been in operation for many years and over that time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that those sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which the company has sent waste may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation it is possible that the company could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

failure to maximize or to successfully assert the company’s intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness the company relies on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property rights the company cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions the company cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold do not protect the company’s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states the failure of the company to perfect or successfully assert its intellectual property rights could make it less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

if the company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others it could impact the company’s competitiveness it is possible that the company will be found to have violated the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others such a finding could result in the need to cease use of a trademark trade secret copyrighted work or patented invention in the company’s business and to pay a substantial amount for past infringement it could also be necessary to pay a substantial amount in the future if the rights holder is willing to permit the company to continue to use the intellectual property right either having to cease use or pay such amounts could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

volatility in the insurance market may result in additional costs and reduced coverage the company will seek to renew or replace various contracts for insurance coverage during the year trends in the insurance industry suggest that such contracts may be much more expensive less protective or even unavailable in such a case the company may decide to selfinsure more thereby undertaking additional risks 

the foregoing list of important factors is not allinclusive the forwardlooking statements are and will be based on management’s then current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance and speak only as of their dates the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise

in november 2002 the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” fin no 45 requires a guarantor to recognize at the inception of a qualified guarantee a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee the company is currently reviewing these recognition and measurement provisions which are effective on a prospective basis for qualified guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 to determine whether they will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements the disclosure requirements of fin no 45 which are effective for this quarter are presented in the following paragraph 

in conjunction with divestitures and other transactions the company occasionally provides routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of trademarks coverage for legal and environmental issues as well as provisions for sales returns and other items currently the company has several such agreements in place with various expiration dates based on historical experience and evaluation of the specific indemnities the company does not believe that any material loss related to such indemnifications is likely and therefore no related liability has been recorded the company also provides a oneyear warranty on a number of its products however due to the historically low rate of product returns no related warranty accrual is deemed necessary in addition the company has also entered into an obligation to purchase raw materials at various indexed prices and has several standby letter of credit agreements none of which are considered material as of december 31 2002 

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure” sfas no148 amends sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair valuebased method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation “transition provisions” in addition sfas no 148 amends the disclosure requirements of accounting principals board apb opinion no 28 interim financial reporting to require proforma disclosure in interim financial statements by companies that elect to account for stockbased compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb opinion no 25 “disclosure provisions” the transition methods of sfas no 148 are effective for the company’s june 30 2003 form 10k the company continues to use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stockbased compensation as a result the transition provisions will not have an effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements the company has elected early adoption of the interim disclosure requirements as presented in note 9 

in january 2003 the fasb issued fin no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” fin no 46 sets forth the criteria used in determining whether an investment in a variable interest entity vie should be consolidated and is based on the general premise that companies that control another entity through interests other than voting interests should consolidate the controlled entity fin no 46 would require the consolidation of specified vies created before february 1 2003 in the company’s september 30 2003 form 10q for specified vies created after january 31 2003 fin no 46 would require consolidation in the company’s march 31 2003 form 10q the company does not expect the implementation of fin no 46 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements

financial instruments

at december 31 2002 and june 30 2002 the company’s derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as assets liabilities as follows 

 

the company utilizes derivative instruments principally interest rate swaps forward purchase contracts and options to enhance its ability to manage risk including interest rates foreign currency fluctuations and commodity price changes which exist as part of its ongoing business operations these contracts hedge transactions and balances for periods consistent with the related exposures and do not constitute investments independent of these exposures the company is not a party to any leveraged contracts 

  most interest rate swaps commodity purchase and foreign exchange contracts are designated as fairvalue or cashflow hedges of fixed and variable interest rate debt obligations and foreign currency denominated debt instruments the estimated fair values of these instruments are calculated based on quoted market prices traded exchange market prices or broker quotes and represent the estimated amounts that the company would pay or receive to terminate the contracts the estimated fair values of the company’s interest rate swaps are based on broker quotations which utilize forward interest rate curves changes in the interest rate curves from june 30 2002 to december 31 2002 reflect declining interest rate market expectations and resulted in an increase in the valuation of interest rate swaps at december 31 2002 as compared to june 30 2002 at december 31 2002 and june 30 2002 the company also had certain derivative contracts with no hedging designations including a forward resin purchase contract that matured on december 31 2002 and did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment these contracts are accounted for by adjusting the carrying amount of the contracts to market value and recognizing any gain or loss in other income or expense for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2002 the company recognized a gain of 4 and for the three and sixmonth periods ended december 31 2001 the company recognized losses of 4 and 5 respectively for its forward resin purchase contract

at december 31 2002 and june 30 2002 the tax effect associated with deferred currency translation adjustments of 108 and 107 respectively for the company’s foreign subsidiaries and equity investments is included in other assets with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive net losses in stockholders’ equity  

during the second quarter the company decided to repatriate earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries under the provisions of sfas nos 109 “accounting for income taxes” and 52 “foreign currency translation” the net earnings of these foreign subsidiaries are subject to a current us tax provision and foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded net of tax this repatriation resulted in an immaterial impact on the current year’s effective tax rate and a 12 increase in other assets and a 12 decrease in accumulated other comprehensive net losses in stockholder’s equity the net earnings of the remaining foreign subsidiaries will remain reinvested indefinitely under the provisions of apb opinion no 23 “accounting for income taxes – special areas” the net earnings of these foreign subsidiaries are not subject to a us tax provision and foreign currency translation adjustments are not recorded net of tax

at december 31 2002 and june 30 2002 the investment fund consisted at estimated fair value of assets of 99 and 109 respectively and liabilities of 85 and 94 respectively marktomarket losses for the three and six month periods ended december 31 2002 and 2001 were insignificant

earnings per common share eps 

basic eps is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding each period diluted eps is computed by dividing net earnings by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through stock options restricted stock warrants and other convertible securities the weighted average number of common shares outstanding denominator used to calculate basic eps is reconciled to those shares used in calculating diluted eps as follows in thousands 

 

stock options to purchase 1037789 and 2821181 shares of common stock for the three months ended december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively and 1483459 and 2841865 shares of common stock for the six months ended december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise price of the stock options was greater than the average market price of the common shares and therefore the effect would be antidilutive

8 goodwill trademarks and other intangible assets continued 

the company had previously planned to review the valuation of the argentina reporting unit during the third quarter of fiscal year 2003 the valuation review was moved to the second quarter because of continued unsettled conditions in the local market and significant changes in competitor actions that resulted in a change in the company’s marketing strategy for the reporting unit based on the updated valuation the company recorded a 30 impairment charge for the argentine business of which 8 was recorded to goodwill 9 to deferred charges and 13 as a reduction in deferred translation any further local market deterioration or failure to achieve the assumptions used in the valuation may lead to future impairment charges 

during the third quarter of this fiscal year the company intends to update the goodwill and intangible asset valuations for all domestic and international reporting units as a result the company will perform the annual valuations prescribed by sfas no 142 during the third fiscal quarter of each fiscal year 

the company’s impairment review and methodology is based on internal valuations using a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgment with future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use foreign exchange rates devaluation inflation and the selection of an appropriate discount rate

diluted net earnings per share increased by 018 and 050 for the three and sixmonth periods ended december 31 2002 respectively as compared to the prior fiscal year periods “the compared periods” primarily due to volume increases lower coupon and trade spending and other cost savings that resulted in increases to gross profit in addition the company’s repurchases of its common stock decreased the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by 15 million shares for each of the compared periods the effect of these repurchases was to increase diluted earnings per share by 002 and 006 for the compared periods 

net sales increased 4 and 6 with volume increases of 1 and 2  for the compared periods the increase in quarterly net sales was driven by volume increases lower trade spending expenses and lower coupon expenses excluding the impacts from the maxforce and himolene businesses divested in fiscal year 2002 and the jonny cat business divested in the first quarter of fiscal year 2003 net sales increased by 7 and 7 and volume increased by 3 and 4 for the compared periods

the household products – latin americaother segment reported net sales decreases of 16 and 14 and net volume decreases of 9 and 8 for the compared periods the decreases in net sales are due primarily to ongoing currency devaluations and volume decreases attributable to the unsettled political and economic situation in the region 

the specialty products segment reported net sales increases of 9 and 7 and net volume gains of 2 and 2 for the compared periods excluding the impacts from the maxforce and jonny cat divestitures net sales increased by 12 and 9 and volume increased by 6 and 5 for the compared periods net sales growth exceeded volume growth primarily due to lower trade spending and coupon expenses excluding the effect of the maxforce divestiture the seasonal division experienced volume growth of 6 and 12 for the compared periods which was driven primarily by charcoal volume growth the food division experienced volume growth of 12 and 14 for the compared periods which was driven by increased marketing support for hidden valley dressings and k c masterpiece barbecue sauces volume for the cat litter and auto care products divisions remained level for the compared periods performance in the cat litter division was affected by lower trade spending while the auto division was impacted by colder weather patterns and new competition with the wipes product

results of operations and financial condition 

results of operations 

selling and administrative expenses decreased by 2 and 7 for the compared periods the decreases were principally due to savings generated from prior year restructuring activities including the elimination of positions both domestically and internationally partly offset by increased performance based incentive compensation costs 

advertising costs as a percentage of net sales increased by 2 for both of the compared periods the increase reflects higher advertising to support the company’s base businesses and the recentlyintroduced readymop selfcontained mopping system and other new product launches 

restructuring and asset impairment costs of 33 million for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2002 are due primarily to a 30 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in the current quarter related to argentina restructuring and asset impairment costs of 66 million and 78 million for the three and sixmonth periods ended december 31 2001 respectively were due to a 39 million goodwill impairment charge associated with the company’s colombian business the remaining charges of 27 million and 39 million for the three and sixmonth periods ended december 31 2001 respectively were for the writeoff of equipment and the closure of certain of the company’s plants and severance costs resulting from the company’s review of operations and its staffing levels 

interest expense decreased by 4 million and 8 million for the compared periods primarily due to lower interest rates 

other income expense net for the three and sixmonths ended december 31 2002 was 3 million and 3 million respectively the primary item included in the current quarter was a 4 million gain on the sale of a property related to an eminent domain proceeding for the sixmonth period this amount was offset by recorded losses of 5 million on the disposal of land equipment and other assets 

the effective tax rate on the continuing operations was 391 for the second quarter as compared to 437 for the year ago quarter the higher rate in second quarter of the prior year is principally due to the interplay between interim period reporting requirements and the recharacterization of prior year losses attributable to discontinued operations 

earnings losses from discontinued operations were 2 million and 11 million for the three and sixmonths ended december 31 2002 as compared to 9 million and 23 million for the three and sixmonths ended december 31 2001 the company plans to sell its business in brazil and recorded an estimated pretax impairment charge of 19 million 13 million after tax during the six months ended december 31 2002 the company also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 28 million during the six months ended december 31 2001 related to brazil the remaining amounts for each period represent the operating income for brazil

working capital 

working capital changes from june 30 2002 as compared to december 31 2002 included decreases in receivables accounts payable and accrued liabilities the decrease in receivables of 156 million from june 30 2002 to december 31 2002 reflects improved collections and lower sales in the second quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year due to the seasonality of the specialty products and household segments the decrease of 176 million from june 30 2002 to december 31 2002 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is attributable to lower trade and coupon spending a payout of value sharing and management compensation bonuses and seasonality in the specialty segment partially offset by current year value sharing and management compensation accruals and the timing of payments relating to project delta advertising interest and other liabilities the decrease of 20 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities from june 30 2001 to december 31 2001 reflects reductions in liabilities due to lower promotional accruals for the seasonal business and timing of payments offset by higher accruals related to the launch of readymop and for restructuring activities

pension obligations 

the company uses discount rate assumptions settlement rates of 675 to 725 and longterm earnings rate assumptions of 80 to 95 in determining the actuarial valuation of its pension plan liabilities and pension expense the differential rates are used because the company’s canadian pension plan has slightly lower assumptions than the us plans the company is reviewing the longterm earnings rate and discount rate assumptions used in the actuarial valuations for the plans any changes in assumptions will be reflected in the june 30 2003 actuarial valuations which will be used to establish expense levels for fiscal year 2004 had the company decreased its longterm earnings rate assumption from 95 to 85 in the june 30 2002 actuarial valuations total pension expense for fiscal year 2003 would have increased by an amount between 2 million and 4 million

 item l business   

a general development of business

for recent business developments refer to the information set forth under the caption managements discussion and analysis on pages a2 through a18 of exhibit 991 hereto incorporated herein by reference 

b financial information about industry segments 

in fiscal year 2002 the company amended its segment definitions the company has three business segments household products—north america household products—latin americaother and specialty products financial information for each of the company’s segments for the last three fiscal years including net sales earnings before income taxes cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and identifiable assets is described in note 18 – industry segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in pages a47 a48 and a49 of exhibit 991hereto incorporated herein by reference 

c narrative description of business 

the companys business operations represented by the aggregate of its household products—north america household products—latin americaother and specialty products segments include the production and marketing of nondurable consumer products sold primarily through grocery and other retail stores for the most part the factors necessary for an understanding of these three segments are essentially the same 

principal products   the household products—north america segment includes the companys household cleaning bleach and other home care products water filtration products food storage and trash disposal categories marketed in the united states and all products marketed in canada the household products—latin americaother segment includes the company’s operations outside the united states and canada exports and puerto rico excluding european automotive care and primarily focuses on the laundry household cleaning automotive care insecticides brazil and korea and food storage and trash disposal categories finally the specialty products segment includes the companys charcoal united states and european automotive care cat litter insecticides dressings and sauces and professional products categories principal products by segment currently marketed in the united states and internationally are listed in exhibit 13 hereto each of the companys segments accounted for more than 10 percent of the companys consolidated revenues during the last threefiscal years as shown in note 18 – industry segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements which appears on pages a47 a48 and a49 of exhibit 991 hereto incorporated herein by reference 

principal markets  methods of distribution   most nondurable household consumer products are nationally advertised and sold within the united states to grocery stores through a network of brokers and sold to mass merchandisers warehouse clubs military and other retail stores primarily through a direct sales force within the united states the company also sells institutional versions of specialty food and nonfood products outside the united states the company sells consumer products through subsidiaries licensees distributors and jointventure arrangements with local partners 

sources and availability of raw materials   the company has obtained ample supplies of all required raw materials and packaging supplies and with few exceptions they were available from a wide variety of sources during fiscal year 2002 polyethylene resin raw materials which are particularly important for the household productsnorth america segment were available from a sufficient number of sources during fiscal year 2002 contingency plans have been developed for any significant raw materials sourced from a single supplier 

patents and trademarks   although some products are covered by patents the company does not believe that patents patent licenses or similar arrangements are material to its business most of the companys brand name consumer products are protected by registered trademarks its brand names and trademarks are extremely important to its business and the company pursues a course of vigorous action against apparent infringements 

seasonality   the specialty products segment is the only portion of the operations of the company that has any significant degree of seasonality most sales of the companys charcoal briquets insecticides and automotive appearance product lines occur in the first six months of each calendar year operating cash flow and short term borrowings are used to build inventories in the offseason and to extend terms to customers 

customers and order backlog   during fiscal years 2002 2001 and 2000 revenues from the companys sales of its products to walmart stores inc and its affiliated companies were 23 percent 20 percent and 19 percent respectively of the companys consolidated net sales except for this relationship the company is not dependent upon any other single customer or group of affiliated customers order backlog is not a significant factor in the companys business 

renegotiation   none of the companys operations is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of the federal government 

competition   the markets for consumer products are highly competitive most of the companys products compete with other nationally advertised brands within each category and with private label brands and generic nonbranded products of grocery chains and wholesale cooperatives competition is encountered from similar and alternative products many of which are produced and marketed by major national concerns having financial resources greater than those of the company depending on the product the companys products compete on price quality or other benefits to consumers 

a newlyintroduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising and sales promotion if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continuing advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position 

research and development   the company incurred expenses of approximately 67 million 67 million and 63 million in fiscal years 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively on research activities relating to the development of new products or the maintenance and improvement of existing products none of this research activity was customersponsored 

environmental matters   historically the company has not made material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities or to comply with environmental laws and regulations however in general the company does anticipate spending increasing amounts annually for facility upgrades and for environmental programs the amount of capital expenditures for environmental compliance was not material in fiscal year 2002 and is not expected to be material in the next fiscal year see the discussions of environmental matters create potential liability risks in item 1 below and legal proceedings in item 3 below 

number of persons employed   at the end of fiscal year 2002 the company employed approximately 9500 people 

forwardlooking statements and risk factors   except for historical information matters discussed in this form 10k including the “managements discussion and analysis” section and statements about future growth are forwardlooking statements based on managements estimates assumptions and projections in addition from time to time the company may make forwardlooking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance business prospects new products research and development activities plans for international expansion acquisitions and similar matters the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the companys actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the companys forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are uncertain the risks and uncertainties that may affect operations performance product development and results of the companys business in a material way some of which may be beyond the control of the company include those discussed elsewhere in this form 10k marketplace conditions and events and the following 

volume growth will be difficult to achieve  over 80 percent of the company’s revenues come from mature markets that are subject to increased competition if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines or develop or acquire and successfully launch new products it will not achieve its growth objectives 

operating results and net earnings may not meet expectations   the company cannot be sure that its operating results and net earnings will meet its expectations if the company’s assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition or if the company does not achieve all of its key goals then the company’s actual performance could vary materially from its expectations the companys operating results and net earnings may be influenced by a number of factors including the following 

the introduction of new products and line extensions by the company or its competitors 

the mix of products sold in a given quarter 

the companys ability to control its internal costs and the cost of raw materials 

significant increases in energy costs 

the effectiveness of the company’s advertising marketing and promotional programs 

changes in product pricing policies by the company or its competitors 

the ability of the company to maintain and enhance profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment 

changes of accounting policies 

the ability of the company to achieve business plans including volume growth and pricing plans despite high levels of competitive activity 

the ability to maintain key customer relationships 

the ability of major customers and other creditors to meet their obligations as they come due 

the ability to successfully manage regulatory tax and legal matters including resolution of pending matters within current estimates 

the ability of the company to attract and retain qualified personnel 

disruptions associated with staff reductions 

expenses for impairment and obsolescence of property plant and equipment in excess of projections 

expenses for impairment of goodwill trademarks and other intangible assets and equity investments in excess of projections 

significant increases in the costs of key raw materials including but not limited to resin corrugated chlorine and caustic although the company has tried to limit the impact of these through contractual terms and other means 

significant increases in interest rates and 

the impact of general economic conditions in the united states and in other countries in which the company currently does business 

in addition sales volume growth whether due to acquisitions or to internal growth can place burdens on the companys management resources and financial controls that in turn can have a negative impact on operating results and net earnings to some extent the company sets its expense levels in anticipation of future revenues if actual revenue falls short of these expectations operating results and net earnings are likely to be adversely affected 

operations outside the united states expose the company to uncertain conditions in overseas markets   the company’s sales outside the united states were 18 percent of net sales in fiscal year 2002 the company has been and will continue to be facing substantial risks associated with having foreign operations including 

economic or political instability in its overseas markets and 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may make the companys products more expensive in its foreign markets or negatively impact its sales or earnings 

largely as a result of these risks the company took substantial impairment charges related to its international operations in fiscal year 2002 and may have to take additional charges in the future refer to the information set forth under the captions “household productslatin americaother” and “south america economic social and political conditions” in managements discussion and analysis on pages a6 a11 and a12 of exhibit 991 hereto incorporated herein by reference in addition these risks could have a significant impact on the companys ability to sell its products on a timely and competitive basis in foreign markets and may have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial position the company seeks to limit its foreign currency exchange risks using operational strategies such as matching receipt and payment currencies it also uses derivative instruments to mitigate certain foreign exposures where such instruments are available at reasonable cost to the company but cannot be sure that this strategy will be successful in addition the companys operations outside the united states are subject to the risk of new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences the company’s small volume in some countries relative to some multinational and local competitors could exacerbate such risks 

implementation of erp system may not be successful   the company is in the process of implementing enterprise resource planning system software this software is designed to improve internal systems and support business processes including order fulfillment if the company fails to implement the software successfully its order fulfillment process and therefore its ability to take ship bill for and collect for orders could be adversely impacted to minimize risk the company has dedicated substantial resources to this project and will implement the software in a staged fashion as a result the company will have to manage in a multiple system environment for a significant period of time employing multiple systems increases the risk that system interfaces will fail resulting in loss of data or inability to process transactions it is expected that the software will enable the company to better understand and control customer payments and deductions and as a result the company is likely to be less tolerant of customer deviations from its policies which might result in friction between the company and certain customers 

integration and management of acquisitions may not be successful   one of the companys strategies is to increase its sales volumes earnings and the markets it serves through acquisitions of or joint ventures with other businesses in the united states and internationally there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify acquire or profitably manage additional companies or operations or that it will be able to successfully integrate future acquisitions into its operations or identify negotiate and successfully manage joint venture opportunities in addition there can be no assurance that companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created will be profitable at their inception or that they will achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made 

disposition of nonstrategic businesses may not be successful the company engages in an ongoing review of its portfolio of businesses if it decides that a business no longer supports the companys strategic direction the company may attempt to sell that business there can be no assurance that any such disposition will occur that if it occurs it will be at a price sufficient to recover the book value of the business disposed of or that the proceeds will be sufficient to avoid reducing earnings 

financial performance depends on continuous and successful new product introductions   in most categories in which the company competes there are frequent introductions of new products and line extensions an important factor in the companys future performance will be its ability to identify emerging consumer and technological trends and to maintain and improve the competitiveness of its products the company cannot be sure that it will successfully achieve those goals continued product development and marketing efforts have inherent risks including development delays the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance and the cost of failed product introductions 

  

government regulations could impose material costs generally the manufacture packaging storage distribution and labeling of the companys products and the companys business operations all must comply with extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations for example in the united states many of the companys products are regulated by the environmental protection agency the food and drug administration and the consumer product safety commission most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas including tax laws could subject the company to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent the company from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results it is possible that the government will increase regulation of the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to enhance homeland security or protect the environment and that such regulation could negatively impact raw material supply or costs 

environmental matters create potential liability risks   the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to air emissions water discharges the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances the company handles hazardous chemicals in quantity at its plant sites a release of such chemicals due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability for the company to governmental authorities or to third parties the company has incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations in the united states and internationally the company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its presently and formerly owned and leased facilities in addition some of the companys present and former facilities have been or had been in operation for many years and over that time some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous it is possible that those sites as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which the company has sent waste may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation it is possible that the company could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition 

failure to protect our intellectual property could impact our competitiveness   the company relies on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property the company cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be successfully asserted in the future or that they will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition laws of some of the foreign countries in which the companys products are or may be sold do not protect the companys intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states the failure of the company to protect its proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against the company could make it less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on the companys business operating results and financial condition there is a risk that the company will not be able to develop locate and where appropriate license necessary technology to support new product introductions it is also possible that the company will be deemed to have violated intellectual property rights granted to others for example a competitor has asserted that elements of the clorox readymop® selfcontained mopping system may infringe existing patents or patents that may issue from pending applications 

volatility in the insurance market may result in additional costs and reduced coverage   the company will seek to renew or replace various contracts for insurance coverage during the year trends in the insurance industry suggest that such contracts may be much more expensive less protective or even unavailable in such a case the company may decide to selfinsure more thereby undertaking additional risks 

the foregoing list of important factors is not allinclusive the forwardlooking statements are and will be based on management’s then current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance and speak only as of their dates the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise

encumbrances  none of the companys owned facilities are encumbered to secure debt owed by the company except that the manufacturing facility in belle mo secures industrial revenue bond indebtedness incurred in relation to the construction and upgrade thereof 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

the company is involved in certain environmental matters including superfund and other response actions at various locations the most significant of which relates to historical disposals of wood tars by a predecessor of the company’s kingsford products company subsidiary during the 1950’s in and around the city of kingsford mich although no formal proceedings are pending response actions at the michigan site are being performed by the company and the ford motor company under the supervision of the michigan department of environmental quality 

the potential cost to the company related to ongoing environmental matters is uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible pollution and cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations and their interpretations and the timing varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies based on its experience the company does not expect that such costs individually or in the aggregate will represent a material cost to the company in excess of amounts already accrued or affect its competitive position as of june 30 2002 167 million was accrued for such probable future costs without discounting for present value

specialty products and international operations financial information for the
last three fiscal years including net sales earnings before income taxes
cumulative effect of


                                     page 2
page   3
change in accounting principle and identifiable assets attributable to each of
the companys industry segments is set forth in note 16  industry segment
information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements which appears
on pages c34 and c35 of exhibit 99 hereto incorporated herein by reference

c narrative description of business

the companys business operations represented by the aggregate of its us
household products and canada us specialty products and international
operations segments include the production and marketing of nondurable
consumer products sold primarily through grocery and other retail stores for
the most part the factors necessary for an understanding of these three
segments are essentially the same

principal products the us household products and canada segment includes the
companys household cleaning bleach and other home care products water
filtration products marketed in the united states and all products marketed in
canada the us specialty products segment includes the companys charcoal
automotive care cat litter insecticide dressings sauces professional
products and food storage and disposal categories finally the international
operations segment which includes the companys overseas operations excluding
canada exports and puerto rico primarily focuses on the laundry household
cleaning automotive care and food storage and disposal categories principal
products by segment currently marketed in the united states and
internationally are listed on pages 21 and 22 of the companys annual report
incorporated herein by reference each of the companys segments accounted for
more than 10 percent of the companys consolidated revenues during the last
three fiscal years as shown in note 16  industry segment information of the
notes to the consolidated financial statements which appears on pages c34 and
c35 of exhibit 99 hereto incorporated herein by reference

principal markets  methods of distribution most nondurable household consumer
products are nationally advertised and sold within the united states to grocery
stores through a network of brokers and to mass merchandisers warehouse clubs
military and other retail stores primarily through a direct sales force the
company also sells within the united states institutional versions of specialty
food and nonfood products outside the united states the company sells
consumer products through subsidiaries licensees distributors and
jointventure arrangements with local partners


                                     page 3
page   4
sources and availability of raw materials the company has obtained ample
supplies of all required raw materials and packaging supplies which with a few
exceptions were available from a wide variety of sources during fiscal year
2001 polyethylene resin raw materials which are particularly important for the
us specialty products segment were available from a wide variety of sources
during fiscal year 2001 and the company has entered into financial instruments
with various maturities partially to stabilize the cost of its polyethylene
resin requirements contingency plans have been developed for any major
singlesourced supplier materials

patents and trademarks although some products are covered by patents the
company does not believe that patents patent licenses or similar arrangements
are material to its business most of the companys brand name consumer products
are protected by registered trademarks its brand names and trademarks are
extremely important to its business and the company pursues a course of
vigorous action against apparent infringements

seasonality the us specialty products segment is the only portion of the
operations of the company that has any significant degree of seasonality most
sales of the companys charcoal briquets insecticides and automotive
appearance product lines occur in the first six months of each calendar year
working capital to carry inventories built up in the offseason and to extend
terms to customers is generally provided by internallygenerated funds plus
commercial paper lines of credit

customers and order backlog during fiscal years 2001 2000 and 1999 revenues
from the companys sales of its products to walmart stores inc and its
affiliated companies were 20 19 and 19 respectively of the companys
consolidated net sales except for this relationship the company is not
dependent upon any other single customer or a small group of customers order
backlog is not a significant factor in the companys business

renegotiation none of the companys operations is subject to renegotiation or
termination at the election of the federal government

competition the markets for consumer products are highly competitive most of
the companys products compete with other nationally advertised brands within
each


                                     page 4
page   5
category and with private label brands and generic nonbranded products of
grocery chains and wholesale cooperatives competition is encountered from
similar and alternative products many of which are produced and marketed by
major national concerns having financial resources greater than those of the
company depending on the competitive product the companys products compete on
price quality or other benefits to consumers

a newlyintroduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed
usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for
advertising and sales promotion if a product gains consumer acceptance it
normally requires continuing advertising and promotional support to maintain its
relative market position

research and development the company incurred expenses of approximately 67
million 63 million and 63 million in fiscal years 2001 2000 and 1999
respectively on research activities relating to the development of new products
or the maintenance and improvement of existing products none of this research
activity was customersponsored

environmental matters historically the company has not made material capital
expenditures for environmental control facilities or to comply with
environmental laws and regulations however in general the company does
anticipate spending increasing amounts annually for facility upgrades and for
environmental programs the amount of capital expenditures for environmental
compliance was not material in fiscal year 2001 and is not expected to be
material in the next fiscal year

the company is involved in certain other environmental matters including
superfund cleanup efforts at various locations the potential cost to the
company related to ongoing environmental matters is uncertain due to such
factors as the unknown magnitude of possible pollution and cleanup costs the
complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations and their
interpretations and the timing varying costs and effectiveness of alternative
cleanup technologies based on its experience and without offsetting for
expected insurance recoveries or discounting for present value the company does
not expect that such costs individually and in the aggregate will represent a
material cost to the company or affect its competitive position

number of persons employed at the end of fiscal year 2001 approximately 11000
people were employed by the company

forwardlooking statements and risk factors except for historical information
matters discussed in this form 10k including the managements discussion and
analysis and statements about future growth are forwardlooking statements
based on managements estimates assumptions and projections in addition from
time to time the company may make forwardlooking statements relating to such
matters as anticipated financial performance business prospects new products
research and development activities plans for international expansion
acquisitions and similar matters the private securities litigation reform act
of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements in order to
comply with the terms of the safe harbor the company notes that a variety of
factors could cause the companys actual results and experience to differ
materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the
companys forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are
uncertain the risks and uncertainties that may affect operations performance
product development and results of the companys business some of which may be
beyond the control of the company include those discussed elsewhere in this
form 10k marketplace conditions and events and the following

operating results may not meet expectations the company cannot be sure that its
operating results will meet its expectations the companys operating results
will be influenced by a number of factors including the following

  the introduction of new products and line extensions by the company or its
   competitors

  the mix of products sold in a given quarter

  the companys ability to control its internal costs and the cost of raw
   materials

  significant increases in energy costs

  changes in product pricing policies by the company or its competitors

  changes in accounting policies or

  the impact of general economic conditions in the united states and in other
   countries in which the company currently does business

in addition sales volume growth whether due to acquisitions or to internal
growth can place burdens on the companys management resources and financial
controls that in turn can have a negative impact on operating results to some
extent the company sets its expense levels in anticipation of future revenues
if actual revenue falls short of these expectations operating results are
likely to be adversely affected


                                     page 6
page   7
failure to implement erp system could adversely impact order processing the
company is in the process of implementing enterprise resource planning system
software this software is designed to improve internal systems and processes
including order fulfillment if the company fails to successfully implement the
software its order fulfillment process and therefore its ability to take
ship bill for and collect for orders could be adversely impacted

operations outside the united states expose the company to uncertain conditions
in overseas markets the company believes that its sales outside the united
states which were 19 of net sales in fiscal year 2001 are likely to increase
as a percentage of its total sales as a result the company will increasingly
face risks associated with having foreign operations including

  economic or political instability in its overseas markets and

  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may make the companys
   products more expensive in its foreign markets or negatively impact its sales
   or earnings

all of these risks could have a significant impact on the companys ability to
sell its products on a timely and competitive basis in foreign markets and may
have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or
financial position the company seeks to limit its foreign currency exchange
risks through the use of foreign currency forward contracts when practical but
cannot be sure that this strategy will be successful in addition the companys
operations outside the united states are subject to the risk of new and
different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions potential
difficulties in staffing and managing local operations credit risk of local
customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences

integration of acquisitions and mergers may not be successful one of the
companys strategies is to increase its sales volumes earnings and the markets
it serves through the acquisition of or merger with other businesses in the
united states and internationally there can be no assurance that the company
will be able to identify acquire or profitably manage additional companies or
operations or successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions or mergers
into its operations in addition there can be no assurance that companies or
operations acquired will be profitable at the time of their acquisition or will
achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investment made

disposition of nonstrategic businesses may not be successful


                                     page 7
page   8
the company engages in ongoing review of its portfolio of businesses if it
decides that a business no longer supports the companys strategic direction
the company may attempt to sell that business there can be no assurance that
any such disposition will occur that if it occurs it will be at a price
sufficient to recover the book value of the business disposed of or that the
proceeds will be sufficient to avoid earnings dilution

financial performance depends on continuous and successful new product
introductions in most categories in which the company competes there are
frequent introductions of new products and line extensions an important factor
in the companys future performance will be its ability to identify emerging
consumer and technological trends and to maintain and improve the
competitiveness of its products the company cannot be sure that it will
successfully achieve those goals continued product development and marketing
efforts have all the risks inherent in the development of new products and line
extensions including development delays the failure of new products and line
extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance and the cost of
failed product introductions

government regulations could impose material costs the manufacture packaging
storage distribution and labeling of the companys products and the companys
business operations generally all must comply with extensive federal state and
foreign laws and regulations for example in the united states many of the
companys products are regulated by the environmental protection agency the
food and drug administration and the consumer product safety commission most
states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies the
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas
including taxes could subject the company to civil remedies including fines
injunctions recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions
any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company loss of or
failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent the
company from introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new
businesses and could adversely affect operating results

environmental matters create potential liability risks the company must comply
with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it
operates including those relating to air emissions water discharges the
handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of
contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances the
company has


                                     page 8
page   9
incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and
other costs in complying with those laws and regulations in the united states
and internationally the company is currently involved in or has potential
liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation
of some of its presently and formerly owned and leased facilities in addition
some of the companys present and former facilities have been or had been in
operation for many years and over that time some of these facilities may have
used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be
considered hazardous it is possible that those sites as well as disposal sites
owned by third parties to which the company has sent waste may in the future be
identified and become the subject of remediation it is possible that the
company could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the
future that could result in a material adverse effect on the companys results
of operations or financial condition

failure to protect our intellectual property could impact our competitiveness
the company relies on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to
protect its intellectual property the company cannot be sure that these
intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will
not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition laws of some of the
foreign countries in which the companys products are or may be sold do not
protect the companys intellectual property rights to the same extent as the
laws of the united states the failure of the company to protect its proprietary
information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement
proceedings against the company could make it less competitive and could have a
material adverse effect on the companys business operating results and
financial condition
