strategy 

we believe that capable operators of strong multiunit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the restaurant industry’s fullservice segment generally the restaurant industry is considered to be comprised of three segments quick service fast casual and fullservice all of our restaurants fall within the fullservice segment which is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains we believe we have strong brands and that the breadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the fullservice restaurant industry this collective capability is the product of investments over many years in areas that are critical to success in our business including restaurant operations excellence brand management excellence supply chain talent management and information technology among other things 

although we have continued to adapt our business model throughout the covid19 pandemic our operating philosophy remains focused on strengthening the core operational fundamentals of the business by providing an outstanding guest experience rooted in culinary innovation attentive service engaging atmosphere and integrated marketing darden enables each brand to reach its full potential by leveraging its scale insights and experience in a way that protects uniqueness and competitive advantages additionally our brands can capitalize on data driven insights to deliver customized onetoone customer relationship marketing we hold ourselves accountable for operating our restaurants with a sense of urgency to achieve our commitments to all of our stakeholders 

recent and planned restaurant growth 

during fiscal 2022 we added 33 net new companyowned restaurants in the united states our fiscal 2022 actual restaurant openings and closings fiscal 2023 projected openings and approximate capital investment square footage and dining capacity by brand 4  are shown below

3 includes bar dining seats and patio seating but excludes bar stools 

4 the capital burger is a developmentstage concept with limited proforma information as such it is excluded from this table 

while our objective is to continue to expand all of our restaurant brands the actual number of openings for each of our brands for fiscal 2023 will depend on many factors including our ability to recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel locate appropriate sites negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms obtain necessary local governmental permits and complete construction 

we consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant’s longterm success and we devote significant effort to the site selection process prior to entering a market we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors these factors include trade area demographics such as target population density and household income levels competitive influences in the trade area the site’s visibility accessibility and traffic volume and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls hotelmotel complexes offices and universities members of senior management evaluate inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after the site is acquired and permits are obtained 

we systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards when a restaurant falls below minimum standards we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes and implement operational and marketing plans to improve that restaurant’s performance if performance does not improve to acceptable levels the restaurant is evaluated for relocation closing or conversion to one of our other brands permanent closures are typically due to economic changes in trade areas the expiration of lease agreements or site concerns accordingly we continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges 

restaurant operations 

we believe that highquality restaurant management is critical to our longterm success our restaurant management structure varies by brand and restaurant size we issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards 

the management structures below describe our restaurant operations during the normal and fully operational conditions that were in place at the end of fiscal 2022 over the course of fiscal 2021 and 2022 as the covid19 pandemic impacted our business the staffing levels at many of our restaurants varied periodically as our dining rooms operated under a range of pandemic conditions that also varied from time to time from state to state and city to city as our restaurant operations continued to evolve in response to the pandemic we have evolved our operational structure and made adjustments to restaurant staffing where appropriate as a result the descriptions below may not precisely reflect the current or future structure of our restaurant operations 

each olive garden restaurant is led by a general manager and each longhorn steakhouse and cheddar’s scratch kitchen restaurant is led by a managing partner each also has three to six additional managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant in addition each restaurant typically employs between 35 to 200 hourly team members most of whom work parttime restaurant general managers or managing partners report to a director of operations who is responsible for approximately five to eleven restaurants each director of operations reports to a senior vice president of operations who is responsible for between 80 and 120 restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by operations management including officer level executives to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards and to solicit feedback on opportunities for improvement

our learning and development team in partnership with each brand’s training leader together with senior operations executives is responsible for developing and maintaining our operations training programs these efforts include an eight to twelveweek training program for management trainees and continuing development programs for all levels of leadership the emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant brand but includes leadership restaurant business management and culinary skills we also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants including deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations the opening training teams typically begin work one and a half weeks prior to opening and remain at the new restaurant for up to three weeks after the opening they are redeployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant’s operating staff 

we maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our managementlevel team members we believe that our leadership position strong resultsoriented culture and various shortterm and longterm incentive programs including stockbased compensation enhances our ability to attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers 

quality assurance 

our total quality department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe highquality food in a clean and safe environment 

food safety and our total quality program 

through rigorous supplier and riskbased product evaluations we purchase only products that meet or exceed our product specifications we rely on independent third parties to inspect and evaluate our suppliers and distributors suppliers that produce “highrisk” products are subject to a food safety evaluation by darden personnel at least annually we require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with comprehensive hazard analysis and critical control point haccp food safety programs and riskbased preventative controls adopted by the us food and drug administration these programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause foodborne illnesses by applying scientificallybased controls to analyze hazards 

identify and monitor critical control points and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met 

third party auditors inspect each restaurant regularly throughout the year to assess food safety and sanitation practices our total quality team verifies the application of preventative controls through onsite support visits ensuring an effective and robust food safety system total quality managers provide support to operations staff with education and training in food safety and sanitation the team also serves as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety 

restaurant guest and team member safety in response to covid19 

in response to the covid19 pandemic throughout fiscal 2022 we have continued to comply with state and local government regulations and health recommendations as applicable to promote guest and team member wellness and to maintain clean restaurants as the pandemic recedes in the united states many of the additional covid19 protocols have been relaxed or removed as of the date of this report nevertheless we are remaining vigilant and may reinstate any of the additional safety or health and wellness precautions if public health conditions worsen in any of our service areas or future government regulations require us to do so 

purchasing and distribution 

our ability to ensure a consistent supply of safe highquality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant brands depends on reliable sources of procurement our purchasing staff sources negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 1500 suppliers whose products originate in more than 35 countries suppliers must meet our requirements and strict quality control standards in the development harvest catch and production of food products competitive bids longterm contracts and strategic supplier relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products 

in response to the ongoing impacts of the covid 19 pandemic the changing environment and global supply chain delays throughout fiscal 2022 we continued to take steps to enhance the safety and reliability of our supply chain 

• sourcing we created and executed contingency plans in anticipation of supply chain obstacles to help mitigate the potential risk of shortages or disruptions in the supply of our key food products 

• distribution  we increased inventory levels for brandcritical items to ensure sufficient supply of necessary products and equipment 

we believe that our significant scale is a competitive advantage and our purchasing team leverages this purchasing capability our purchasing staff travels routinely within the united states and internationally to source topquality food products at competitive prices we actively engage with and monitor our suppliers both in person and remotely including hosting virtual visits and audits we believe that we have established excellent longterm relationships with key suppliers and usually source our product directly from producers not brokers or middlemen we actively support several national minority supplier organizations to ensure that we incorporate women and minorityowned businesses in our purchasing decisions 

we have entered into longterm agreements with multiple thirdparty national distribution companies to deliver food and supplies to our restaurants under these arrangements we maintain ownership of the food and supplies inventory through our subsidiary darden direct distribution inc darden direct this inventory is stored in distribution company warehouses that are wholly or primarily dedicated to darden where practical to do so because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales 

we continue to drive automation of our supply chain by collaborating with our suppliers logistics partners and distributors to improve optimization with information visibility and other technological advances these and other terms of darden direct’s longterm supply agreements further enable our purchasing staff to integrate demand forecasts into our purchasing operations driving efficiencies in our operations 

advertising and marketing 

integrated marketing is a key element of our strategy and our scale enables us to be a leading advertiser in the fullservice dining segment of the restaurant industry olive garden leverages the efficiency of national advertising on both traditional and streaming television supplemented with additional targeted digital media investments longhorn steakhouse uses digital advertising to build engagement and loyalty by market cheddar’s scratch kitchen yard house the capital grille seasons 52 bahama breeze eddie v’s and the capital burger do not use television advertising but rely on local and digital marketing during fiscal 2022 we continued to direct more of our marketing efforts towards digital channels rather than traditional media outlets our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to build awareness and strengthen our 

brands’ relevance we implement periodic promotions as appropriate to increase frequency of guest visits while maintaining overall profitability we also rely on outdoor billboard direct mail and email advertising as well as radio newspapers digital coupons search engine marketing and social media such as facebook® and instagram® as appropriate to attract engage and retain our guests we have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor guest satisfaction and evolving food service trends and marketplace dynamics 

in fiscal 2022 we continued a multiyear effort to implement new technology platforms that allow us to digitally engage with our guests and team members and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities in an increasingly connected society we also continued making improvements to our online and mobile ordering system for olive garden and longhorn steakhouse and accelerated rollout of online and mobile ordering and payment systems across all of our other brands in addition we continued working on developing sophisticated customer relationship management programs data analytics and datadriven marketing approaches to effectively and efficiently target our existing and potential guests across our portfolio of brands this enables us to tailor our messaging and offerings depending on guest visit history preferences and brand loyalty 

human capital 

we prioritize our team members through our people strategy that includes four strategic imperatives 

• hire  attract and select diverse team members that reflect our values and are committed to our resultsoriented culture 

• train  teach team members to perform in today’s environment and develop the skills to meet tomorrow’s needs 

• reward  invest in compelling programs that recognize team members when goals are achieved and further motivate our culture of winning and 

• retain  keep team members engaged and motivated ready to deliver results and grow their careers 

we closely track and assess a variety of metrics that help us to evaluate our performance of each of these imperatives 

hire we are committed to attracting engaging developing and retaining a workforce that mirrors the diversity of our guests and the communities in which we operate we track a variety of workforce statistics to help us understand the gender racial and ethnic diversity of our team members key team member statistics as of the end of fiscal 2022 included the following 



in addition to the gender racial and ethnic diversity of our workforce our team members are also very diverse in age we employ members of five generations of the united states population traditionalists baby boomers generation x millennials and centennials we provide our eeo1 report and additional details about our inclusion and diversity programs on our website at wwwdardencom 

train we succeed because of our people and with our success come rewards recognition and great opportunities for our team members we regularly invest in our team members’ careers by providing the tools they need to succeed in their current roles to grow personally and professionally and to deliver exceptional experiences to our guests each day with thousands of leadership positions across our restaurants we provide a pathway and training for thousands of individuals across the country to advance from entrylevel jobs into management roles in fiscal 2022 62 of the participants in our restaurant manager in training program were internal promotions and 100 of the new general managers or managing partners were internal promotions 

reward we believe that we provide working conditions and pay and benefits that compare favorably with those of our competitors most team members other than restaurant management and corporate management are paid on an hourly basis we offer our team members flexible work schedules and competitive pay and benefits including paid sick leave and access to free counseling through our employee assistance program for team members and their families in march of 2021 we announced that every hourly restaurant team member companywide would earn a minimum hourly wage of at least 10 per hour inclusive of tip income starting immediately and we committed to increase that minimum wage to 11 per hour in january 2022 and 12 per hour in january 2023 due to the current inflationary environment we accelerated the increase to 12 per hour to become effective january 1 2022 

in addition to reward our restaurant management teams for successfully navigating through the challenges of the covid19 pandemic impacts on their operations during fiscal 2022 we enhanced each of the quarterly restaurant management team bonus payouts in order to reward all of our restaurant general managers and managing partners for navigating the pandemic and increase retention of these key team members in the mediumterm we awarded each of our restaurant managers and general partners incremental longterm cash settled stock based incentive grants in june 2021 with a total value of over 18 million 

none of our team members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our team member relations to be good 

consistent with our core values of respect caring and teamwork in fiscal 1999 we established a program called darden dimes to help fellow darden team members in need darden dimes provides shortterm financial grants to team members experiencing financial need caused by unexpected emergencies or catastrophic natural disasters participating team members donate as little as 10 cents from each paycheck to the darden dimes fund which raises and grants approximately 14 million annually 

retain as a fullservice restaurant company food is always top of mind but our team members make the difference they are at the heart of everything we do we believe the guest experience can never exceed the team member experience so we strive to hire the best individuals and retain them by fostering an environment of respect and inclusion where diversity of thought and background is valued and everyone has the opportunity to develop and grow their careers in addition our geographic footprint often puts us in a position to offer our restaurant team members jobs in their current roles when personal circumstances require relocation 

despite impacts of covid19 on our business and our workforce darden’s consolidated turnover rate for hourly team members during fiscal 2022 was 1083 one of the lowest rates in the restaurant industry each of our brands experienced a turnover rate during fiscal 2022 that was lower than the most recent relevant casual dining or fine dining turnover rate for their industry as reported in the people report tm by black box intelligence tm  darden’s consolidated restaurant management turnover rate of 219 was also significantly lower than the industry benchmark our executive leadership vice president and above has an average of over 17 years of experience with darden while our restaurant general managers and managing partners have an average of 14 years of experience with us 

information technology and cybersecurity

competition 

the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food price service restaurant location personnel brand attractiveness of facilities availability of carryout and home delivery internet and mobile ordering capabilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing the restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing restaurants and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power we compete within each market with national and regional chains and locallyowned restaurants for guests management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites in addition expanding product offerings at fast casual and quickservice restaurants and the convenience of home delivery services together with negative economic conditions could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives or reduce the frequency of their restaurant visits we expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas

our sales volumes have historically fluctuated seasonally typically our average sales per restaurant are highest in the winter and spring followed by the summer and lowest in the fall holidays changes in the economy severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions because of the historical seasonality of our business and these other factors results for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

government regulation 

we are subject to various federal state local and international laws affecting our business each of our restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities which include health safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located the development and operation of restaurants depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites which are subject to zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations to date we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals 

the covid19 pandemic caused a panoply of federal state and local government regulations affecting our business to be issued and frequently revised on a daily andor weekly basis beginning in march 2020 and continuing through most of fiscal 2021 regulations relating to paid sick leave opening and closing of bars restaurants and dining rooms business hours sanitation practices to go alcohol sales guest spacing within dining rooms and other social distancing practices and ppe usage by both team members and guests have materially affected the way we operate our business and serve our guests most of these regulations were rolled back by end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and as of the end of fiscal 2022 very few covid19specific operating restrictions remained in place in the united states however we continue to monitor the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and it is possible that certain regulations could be reimposed in the future if the united states or portions thereof experience additional outbreaks 

during fiscal 2022 116 percent of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site in most cases on an annual basis and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time these regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant operation including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours of operation advertising wholesale purchasing inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages as a result of the impact of covid19 pandemic on restaurants many states have modified their regulations to permit to go sales of alcoholic beverages and in some locations we now offer a variety of alcoholic beverages including in bottles from draft and mixed drinks to go the failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these alcoholic beverage licenses or to comply with regulations governing the sale of alcoholic beverages would adversely affect the restaurant’s operations we also are subject in certain states to “dram shop” statutes which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person who then causes injury to himself or a third party we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance 

we also are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws governing such matters as overtime tip credits working conditions paid leave safety standards and hiring and employment practices 

since 1995 darden has had a tip rate alternative commitment trac agreement with the internal revenue service trac requirements which include increased educational and other efforts in each restaurant to increase the reporting compliance of employees with respect to cash tips are applied across all of our brands compliance with trac requirements reduces the 

likelihood of potential employeronly fica tax assessments related to cash tips that are unreported by employees at darden’s covered units consistent with our longstanding agreement with the irs we work proactively with irs personnel responsible for tip compliance to ensure that we are taking the appropriate steps to continue to meet our trac obligations 

we are subject to federal and state environmental regulations but these rules have not had a material effect on our operations during fiscal 2022 there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated 

our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 ada and related state accessibility statutes under the ada and related state laws we must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment and when constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of our restaurants we must make those facilities accessible 

we are subject to federal and state regulations relating to employerprovided health insurance but these rules have not had a material effect on our operations 

we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food including regulations regarding product safety nutritional content and menu labeling we are subject to laws and regulations requiring disclosure of calorie fat trans fat salt and allergen content 

we are subject to laws relating to information security privacy cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud an increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information including social security numbers financial information including credit card numbers and health information as a merchant and service provider of pointofsale services we are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard issued by the payment card industry council pci dss 

we are subject to anticorruption laws in the united states and in the international jurisdictions where we do business including the foreign corrupt practices act we are also subject to a variety of international laws relating to franchising and licensing of intellectual property in the various countries across the world where we are engaged in franchising our restaurant brands 

see item 1a “risk factors” below for a discussion of risks relating to federal state and local regulation of our business including in the areas of data privacy and environmental matters 

sustainability 

the sustainability of our food sources and restaurant operations is a key component of providing great service and food to our guests during fiscal 2022 we remained focused on our climate strategy restaurant sustainability metrics and darden’s animal welfare council given the current economic environment we will continue to adapt our sustainability approach with development or enhancement of integrated and strategic priorities in the near term across the enterprise from the food we source to the operation of our restaurants 

darden manages energy and water conservation within our restaurant operations in fiscal 2021 we experienced reductions in energy and water usage directly related to covid19 impacts to the business and we do not expect these results to continue yearoveryear darden measures and reports environmental metrics for owned and operated restaurants only

 item 1a risk factors 

various risks and uncertainties could affect our business any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations 

risks relating to the covid19 pandemic and macroeconomic disruption 

the covid19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt our business and the global economy which has affected and could continue to materially affect our operations financial condition and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic federal state and local government responses to covid19 and our company’s responses to the outbreak have all disrupted and may continue to disrupt our business in the united states over the course of fiscal 2021 state and local governments imposed a variety of restrictions on people and businesses and public health authorities offered regular guidance on health and safety once covid19 vaccines were approved and moved into wider distribution in the united states in early 2021 public health conditions improved and almost all of the covid19 restrictions on businesses eased during fiscal 2022 increases in the numbers of cases of covid19 throughout the united states including the omicron variant which significantly impacted our restaurants in the third quarter mostly in january 2022 subjected some of our restaurants to other covid19related restrictions such as mask andor vaccine requirements for team members guests or both exclusions and quarantines of restaurant team members or groups thereof disrupt an individual restaurant’s operations and often come with little or no notice to the local restaurant management during fiscal 2022 along with covid19 our operating results were impacted by geopolitical and other macroeconomic events leading to higher than usual inflation on wages and other cost of goods sold these events further impacted the availability of team members needed to staff our restaurants and caused additional disruptions in our product supply chain 

the ongoing effects of covid19 and its variants along with other geopolitical and macroeconomic events could lead to future capacity restrictions mask and vaccination mandates wage inflation staffing challenges product cost inflation and disruptions in the supply chain that impact our restaurants’ ability to obtain the products needed to support their operations 

a failure to address cost pressures including rising costs for commodities labor health care and utilities used by our restaurants and a failure to effectively deliver cost management activities and achieve economies of scale in purchasing could compress our margins and adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food ingredients labor health care utilities fuel and other related costs over which we may have little control we have experienced and continue to experience inflationary conditions with respect to all of these cost areas during fiscal 2022 operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities including beef pork chicken seafood cheese butter and produce the introduction of or changes to tariffs on imported food products such as produce and seafood could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products we cannot predict whether we will continue to be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices menu offerings and menu prices and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results we attempt to leverage our size to achieve economies of scale in purchasing but there can be no assurances that we can always do so effectively we are also subject to the general risks of inflation 

increases in minimum wage health care and other benefit costs may have a material adverse effect on our labor costs we operate in many states and localities where the minimum wage is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage the market for labor in the united states is competitive and has resulted in pressure on wages and may continue to do so in the future increases in minimum wage and market pressure may also result in increases in the wage rates paid for nonminimum wage positions many states and localities are also passing laws regulating employment practices and working conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our labor costs in those areas 

our restaurants’ operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as electricity and natural gas whether as a result of inflation or otherwise on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply in addition interruptions to the availability of gas electric water or other utilities whether due to aging infrastructure weather conditions fire animal damage trees digging accidents geopolitical impacts or other reasons largely out of our control may adversely affect 

our operations our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

certain economic and business factors and their impacts on the restaurant industry and other general macroeconomic factors including unemployment energy prices and interest rates that are largely beyond our control may adversely affect consumer behavior and our results of operations 

our business results depend on a number of industryspecific and general economic factors many of which are beyond our control the fullservice dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in international national regional and local economic conditions seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant brands the performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends severe weather including hurricanes traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants 

general economic conditions including economic downturns related to the covid19 pandemic geopolitical conditions and uncertainty about the strength or pace of economic recovery have also adversely affected our results of operations and may continue to do so economic recession a protracted economic slowdown a worsening economy increased unemployment increased energy prices rising interest rates a downgrade of the us government’s longterm credit rating imposition of retaliatory tariffs on important us imports and exports or other industrywide cost pressures have affected and can continue to affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings economic uncertainty has caused and may continue to cause guests to make fewer discretionary purchases and any significant decrease in our guest traffic or average profit per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance in addition if gasoline natural gas electricity and other energy costs remain at the current elevated levels or increase further and credit card home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency of their dining occasions may spend less on each dining occasion or may choose more inexpensive restaurants 

furthermore we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts including the ongoing armed conflict in the ukraine terrorist attacks efforts to combat terrorism heightened security requirements or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems could have on our operations the economy or consumer confidence generally any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures 

unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our guests could increase our costs reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to human capital 

the inability to hire train reward and retain restaurant team members and determine and maintain adequate staffing may impact our ability to achieve our operating growth and financial objectives 

our longterm growth depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain highquality team members to work in and manage our restaurants adequate staffing and retention of qualified restaurant team members is a critical factor impacting our guests’ experience in our restaurants maintaining adequate staffing in our existing restaurants and hiring and training staff for our new restaurants requires precise workforce planning which has been complicated by the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our business the relevant labor market and on consumer preferences the market for the most qualified talent continues to be competitive and we must provide competitive wages benefits and workplace conditions to maintain our most qualified team members personal or public health concerns related to covid19 may continue to make some existing team members or potential candidates reluctant to work in enclosed restaurant environments we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges in recruiting and retaining team members in various locations a shortage of qualified candidates who meet all legal citizenship or work authorization requirements failure to recruit and retain new team members in a timely manner or higher than expected turnover levels all could affect our ability to open new restaurants grow sales at existing restaurants or meet our labor cost objectives an inability to adequately monitor and proactively respond to team member dissatisfaction could lead to poor guest satisfaction higher turnover litigation and unionization which could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets or impact our results of operations 

a failure to recruit develop and retain effective leaders or the loss or shortage of personnel with key capacities and skills could impact our strategic direction and jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets 

our future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other leadership team members we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management team members in order to achieve our current business 

objectives and support our projected growth changes in senior management could expose us to significant changes in strategic direction and initiatives a failure to maintain appropriate organizational capacity and capability to support leadership excellence adequate resources innovative skill sets and expectations and build adequate bench strength required for growth or a loss of key skill sets could jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets 

we may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs 

our restaurant operations are subject to united states and canadian federal state and local laws governing such matters as minimum wages working conditions overtime and tip credits as federal state and local minimum wage rates increase we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage labor shortages increased employee turnover and health care and other benefit or working condition regulations also have increased and may continue to increase our labor costs these increased costs could in turn lead us to increase our menu prices which could impact our sales conversely if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in menu prices our profitability may decline in addition the current premiums that we pay for our insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property health and directors’ and officers’ liability may increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs the dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers’ compensation and general liability insurance for which we carry high perclaim deductibles may also increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs further the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses 

risks relating to health and safet y 

health concerns arising from foodrelated pandemics outbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

in addition to the novel coronavirus that causes covid19 the united states and other countries have experienced or may experience in the future outbreaks of other viruses such as norovirus avian flu or “sars” “mers” h1n1 or “swine flu” or other diseases to the extent that a virus or disease is foodborne or perceived to be foodborne future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product or could reduce public confidence in food handling andor public assembly for example public concern over avian flu may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry the inability to serve poultrybased products would restrict our ability to provide a variety of menu items to our guests if we change a restaurant menu in response to such concerns we may lose guests who do not prefer the new menu and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new guest base to produce the sales needed to make the restaurant profitable we also may have different or additional competitors for our intended guests as a result of such a change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors if a virus is transmitted by human contact or respiratory transmission our employees or guests could become infected or could choose or be advised to avoid gathering in public places any of which could adversely affect our restaurant guest traffic and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level we also could be adversely affected if the world health organization andor the united states centers for disease control were to restrict travel to affected geographic areas where we source our products thus possibly impacting the continuity of supply additionally jurisdictions in which we have restaurants may impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may cause guests to choose other alternatives to dining out in our restaurants which may adversely affect our business 

a failure to maintain food safety throughout the supply chain and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

food safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe quality food products even with strong preventative interventions and controls food safety issues could be caused at the source or by food suppliers or distributors and as a result be out of our control and require prompt action to mitigate impact in addition regardless of the source or cause any report of foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a norovirus or salmonella or other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination at one of our restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our brands and have a negative impact on our sales even instances of foodborne illness food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients resulting in higher costs and lower margins 

risks relating to information technology and privacy 

we rely heavily on information technology in our operations and insufficient guest or employee facing technology or a failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network free from material failure interruption or security breach could harm our ability to effectively operate our business andor result in the loss of respected relationships with our guests or employees 

we rely heavily on information systems across our operations including for ecommerce marketing programs employee engagement management of our supply chain the pointofsale processing system in our restaurants and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability security and capacity of these systems in addition we must effectively respond to changing guest expectations and new technological developments disruptions failures or other performance issues with guest facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our business and negatively affect our relationship with our guests the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems a material network breach in the security of these systems as a result of a cyber attack phishing attack ransomware attack or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to the company our team members or guests this could include the theft of our intellectual property trade secrets or sensitive financial information some of these essential business processes that are dependent on technology are outsourced to third parties while we make efforts to ensure that our providers are observing proper standards and controls we cannot guarantee that breaches or failures caused by these outsourced providers will not occur 

any such failures or disruptions may cause delays in guest service reduce efficiency in our operations require significant capital investments to remediate the problem result in customer employee or advertiser dissatisfaction or otherwise result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation we could also be subjected to litigation regulatory investigations or the imposition of penalties as information security laws and regulations change and cyber risks evolve we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance and protect guest employee and company information 

we may incur increased costs to comply with privacy and data protection laws and if we fail to comply or our systems are compromised we could be subject to government enforcement actions private litigation and adverse publicity 

we receive and maintain certain personal financial and other information about our customers employees vendors and suppliers in addition certain of our vendors receive and maintain certain personal financial and other information about our employees and customers the use and handling including security of this information is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding data privacy laws and regulations in various jurisdictions as well as by certain thirdparty contracts and industry standards complying with newly developed laws and regulations which are subject to change and uncertain interpretations and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction may lead to a decline in guest engagement or cause us to incur substantial costs or modifications to our operations or business practices to comply in addition if our security and information systems are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss cyber attack or a network security incident or if our employees or vendors fail to comply with these laws and regulations or fail to meet industry standards and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately it could result in liabilities and penalties and could damage our reputation cause interruption of normal business performance cause us to incur substantial costs and result in a loss of customer confidence which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition additionally we could be subject to litigation and government enforcement actions as a result of any such failure 

risks related to the restaurant industry 

we are subject to a number of risks relating to public policy changes and federal state and local regulation of our business including in the areas of environmental matters minimum wage employee benefit regulations unionization menu labeling immigration requirements and taxes and an insufficient or ineffective response to legislation or government regulation may impact our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability 

the restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal state local and international laws and regulations the development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites which are subject to building zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations and requirements we are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health sanitation safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food including regulations regarding product safety nutritional content and menu labeling we are subject to federal state and local laws governing employment practices and working conditions these laws cover minimum wage rates wage and hour practices labor relations paid and family leave workplace safety and immigration among others the myriad of laws and regulations being passed at the state and local level creates unique challenges for a multistate employer as different standards apply to different locations sometimes with conflicting 

requirements we must continue to monitor and adapt our employment practices to comply with these various laws and regulations 

we also are subject to federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities such as the ada compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation new or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our labor costs 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge emission and disposal of hazardous materials there also has been increasing focus by united states and overseas governmental authorities on other environmental matters such as climate change the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption this increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating a yet to be specified array of environmental matters legislative regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials taxes transportation and utilities which could decrease our operating profits and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment 

we are subject to laws relating to information security cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and any failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws or any breach of our systems could harm our reputation or lead to litigation which could adversely affect our financial condition 

the impact of current laws and regulations the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues could negatively impact our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal state and local authorities could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings 

we face intense competition and if we have an insufficient focus on competition and the consumer landscape our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the fullservice dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing service location personnel takeout and delivery options and type and quality of food and there are many wellestablished competitors we compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locallyowned restaurants we also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services particularly in the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées side dishes or meal preparation kits from the deli or prepared foods sections we compete primarily on the quality variety and value perception of menu items the number and location of restaurants type of brand quality and efficiency of service attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors we anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors if we are unable to continue to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are subject to changes in consumer preferences that may adversely affect demand for food at our restaurants 

consumers are continually changing health and dietary preferences as a result our diverse portfolio of restaurant brands are continually challenged to evolve our menu offerings to appeal to these changing customer preferences while maintaining our brand character and retaining popular menu items in response to the covid19 pandemic during periods of high public health risk many consumers chose to order food to go or for delivery rather than dining in at fullservice restaurants if covid19 cases increase or other future public health issues cause these preferences to increase we may need to further adapt our offerings to respond to these additional changes new information or changes in dietary nutritional allergen or health guidelines or environmental or sustainability concerns whether issued by government agencies academic studies advocacy organizations or similar groups may cause some groups of consumers to select foods other than those that are offered by our restaurants if we fail to anticipate changing trends or other consumer preferences our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business 

the proliferation and utilization of existing and innovative social media platforms allows individuals and businesses access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate each of which may harm our performance prospects or business the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction the dissemination of information online could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations regardless of the information’s accuracy 

  

our competitors are constantly expanding their use of social media and new social media platforms are rapidly being developed potentially making more traditional social media platforms obsolete as a result we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies in order to maintain broad appeal with guests and brand relevance as part of our marketing efforts we rely on social media platforms and search engine marketing to attract and retain guests we also continue to invest in other digital marketing initiatives that allow us to reach our guests across multiple digital channels and build their awareness of engagement with and loyalty to our brands these initiatives may not be successful resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues increased employee engagement or brand recognition in addition a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media including the improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about us exposure of personally identifiable information fraud or outofdate information the inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation 

a failure to identify and execute innovative marketing and guest relationship tactics ineffective or improper use of other marketing initiatives and increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

if our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions if our advertising media or marketing expenses increase if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors or if we do not adequately leverage technology and data analytic capabilities needed to generate concise competitive insight we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations a failure to sufficiently innovate develop guest relationship initiatives or maintain adequate and effective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales 

as part of our marketing efforts we rely on social media platforms and search engine marketing to attract and retain guests these initiatives may not be successful and pose a variety of other risks as discussed above under the heading “our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business” 

climate change adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could adversely affect our restaurant sales or results of operations 

the longterm effects of climate change and global warming will result in more severe volatile weather or extended droughts which could increase the frequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations adverse weather conditions have in the past and may continue to impact guest traffic at our restaurants cause the temporary underutilization of outdoor patio seating and in more severe cases such as hurricanes tornadoes wildfires or other natural disasters cause property damage and temporary closures sometimes for prolonged periods which could negatively impact our restaurant sales or costs climate change and government regulation relating to climate change including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could result in construction delays and increased costs interruptions to the availability or increases in the cost of utilities and shortages or interruptions in the supply or increases to the costs of food items and other supplies 

risks relating to our business model and strategy 

a majority of our restaurants are operated in leased properties and as a result we are committed to longterm lease obligations that we may not be able to cancel if we want to close a restaurant location and we may be unable to renew the leases that we may want to extend at the end of their terms 

as of may 29 2022 1791 of our 1867 restaurants operating in the united states and canada operate in leased locations and the leases are generally noncancellable for some period of time if we close a restaurant in a leased location we may remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease which would include among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term additionally the potential losses associated with our inability to cancel leases may result in our keeping open restaurant locations that are performing significantly below targeted levels as a result ongoing lease obligations at closed or underperforming restaurant locations could impair our results of operations in addition at the end of the 

lease term and expiration of all renewal periods we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost if at all as a result we may be required to close or relocate a restaurant which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks and may have an adverse effect on our operating performance 

our inability or failure to execute on a comprehensive business continuity plan following a major natural disaster such as a hurricane or manmade disaster at our corporate facility could have a materially adverse impact on our business 

many of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one florida location   we have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature including hurricanes and other natural or manmade disasters and back up and offsite locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information however if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans we may experience delays in recovery of data inability to perform vital corporate functions tardiness in required reporting and compliance failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims 

we may lose sales or incur increased costs if our restaurants experience shortages delays or interruptions in the delivery of food and other products from our third party vendors and suppliers 

we have a limited number of suppliers and distributors for certain of our products and services shortages delays or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants may be caused by severe weather natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods droughts wildfires and earthquakes macroeconomic conditions resulting in disruptions to the shipping and transportation industries labor issues such as increased costs or worker shortages or other operational disruptions at our suppliers vendors or other service providers the inability of our vendors or service providers to manage adverse business conditions obtain credit or remain solvent or other conditions beyond our control such shortages delays or interruptions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants supply chain disruptions have increased some of our costs and limited the availability of certain products for our restaurants during fiscal 2022 and may continue to do so if we increase menu prices as a result of increased food costs or remove menu items due to shortages such responses may negatively impact our sales if we temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular items from a restaurant’s menu that restaurant may experience a significant reduction in sales during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our guests changing their dining habits 

our failure to drive both shortterm and longterm profitable sales growth through brand relevance operating excellence opening new restaurants of existing brands and acquiring new restaurant brands could result in poor financial performance 

as part of our business strategy we intend to drive profitable sales growth by increasing samerestaurant sales at existing restaurants continuing to expand our current portfolio of restaurant brands and acquiring additional brands that can be expanded profitably this strategy involves numerous risks and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives 

at existing brands we may not be able to maintain brand relevance and restaurant operating excellence to achieve sustainable samerestaurant sales growth and warrant new unit growth existing brand shortterm sales growth could be impacted if we are unable to drive near term guest count and sales growth and longterm sales growth could be impacted if we fail to extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to our guests a failure to innovate and extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to guests and occasions in order to generate sustainable samerestaurant traffic growth and produce nontraditional sales and earnings growth opportunities insufficient focus on our competition or failure to adequately address declines in the casual dining industry could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition we may not be able to support sustained new unit growth or open all of our planned new restaurants and the new restaurants that we open may not be profitable or as profitable as our existing restaurants new restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize and even sales at successful newlyopened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation the opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on guest counts and sales levels at existing restaurants 

the ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations the need to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses on a timely basis the need to comply with other regulatory requirements the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay construction increases in labor and building material costs supply chain disruptions the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms changes in patterns or severity of weather or other acts of god that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time our ability to hire and train qualified management 

personnel and general economic and business conditions at each potential location we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites construction contractors management personnel hourly employees and other resources if we are unable to successfully manage these risks we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated sales and earnings in future periods 

we also may not be able to identify and successfully acquire and integrate additional brands that are as profitable as our existing restaurants or that provide potential for further growth 

a lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

the success of our restaurants depends in large part on their locations as demographic and economic patterns change current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations in addition desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation the occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may experience higherthananticipated costs or delays associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants we incur substantial preopening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close relocate or remodel existing restaurants the expenses of opening closing relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated increases in the time to procure or shortages of construction labor and materials and capital equipment or permitting delays may impact the time it takes to open new restaurants an increase in such expenses or delays in the timeline to complete construction could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees and licensees 

certain of our domestic and all of our international locations other than in canada are operated by franchisees or licensees we believe that we have selected highcaliber operating partners and franchisees with significant experience in restaurant operations and are providing them with training and support however the probability of opening ultimate success and quality of any franchise or licensed restaurant rests principally with the franchisee or licensee if the franchisee or licensee does not successfully open and operate its restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards or guests have negative experiences due to issues with food quality or operational execution our brand values could suffer which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we face a variety of risks associated with doing business with business partners and vendors in foreign markets 

we are making efforts to expand our brands overseas through licensing and franchising relationships there is no assurance that international operations will be profitable or that international growth will continue our international operations are subject to all of the same risks associated with our domestic operations as well as a number of additional risks these include among other things international economic and political conditions foreign currency fluctuations and differing cultures and consumer preferences in addition expansion into international markets could create risks to our brands and reputation 

we also are subject to governmental regulations throughout the world that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors these include antitrust and tax requirements antiboycott regulations importexportcustoms regulations and other international trade regulations the usa patriot act the foreign corrupt practices act and applicable local law failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we may use to hedge exposures to fluctuations in commodity and broader market prices may cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we use or may use derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our principal ingredient labor and energy costs including but not limited to coffee butter wheat soybean oil pork beef diesel fuel gasoline and natural gas changes in the values of these derivatives may be recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings included in our consolidated financial statements 

volatility in the united states equity markets affects our ability to efficiently hedge exposures to our market risk related to equitybased compensation awards 

the equity markets in the united states continue to be volatile due to the ongoing impacts of the covid19 pandemic macroeconomic conditions geopolitical concerns and due to the unpredictability of the recovery of the united states economy as a result of these factors market volatility has contributed to and may continue to contribute to fluctuations in the company’s stock price we have equity hedges in place to protect the company from exposure to market risk related to future payout of equitybased compensation awards however because these hedges also net settle on a cash basis quarterly we have been and may in the future be required to make cash payments at those quarterly settlement dates and the amounts of those payments are difficult to during periods of extreme volatility in the equity markets these cash payments may ultimately be offset by payments to us from the hedge counterparties or reductions in expected payouts to employees when those equity hedges finally fully settle and the related equity awards pay out 

failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business 

we regard our olive garden ®  longhorn steakhouse ®  cheddar’s scratch kitchen ®  yard house ®  the capital grille ®  seasons 52 ®  bahama breeze ®  eddie v’s prime seafood ®  the capital burger ®  darden ® and darden restaurants ® service marks and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts copyrights patents trademarks service marks and other common law rights such as trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our restaurants and services from infringement we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the united states and foreign jurisdictions however we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other persons although our policy is to oppose any such infringement further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources 

general risks 

litigation including allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees guests suppliers business partners shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation these actions and proceedings may involve allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices including wage and hour violations and employment discrimination guest discrimination food safety issues including poor food quality foodborne illness food tampering food contamination and adverse health effects from consumption of various food products or highcalorie foods including obesity other personal injury including claims related to covid19 violation of “dram shop” laws providing an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or a third party trademark infringement violation of the federal securities laws or other concerns the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time the cost to defend litigation may be significant there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease guest acceptance of our brands regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are found liable litigation could impact our operations in other ways as well allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices for example could adversely affect employee acquisition and retention as a result litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable publicity or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could harm our reputation and adversely impact our guest counts and sales 

the good reputation of our restaurant brands is a key factor in the success of our business actual or alleged incidents at any of our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could harm our brands even incidents occurring at restaurants operated by our competitors or in the supply chain generally could result in negative publicity that could harm the restaurant industry overall and indirectly our own brands negative publicity may result from allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices employee dissatisfaction guest discrimination illness injury or any of the other matters discussed above that could give rise to litigation regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants or to only a single restaurant could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand 

negative publicity also may result from health concerns including food safety and flu or virus outbreaks publication of government or industry findings concerning food products environmental disasters crime incidents data security breaches scandals involving our employees or operational problems at our restaurants all of which could make our brands and menu offerings less appealing to our guests and negatively impact our guest counts and sales adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of our brands or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business 

disruptions in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact consumer spending patterns and affect the availability and cost of credit 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control turmoil in global credit markets could adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future there can be no assurances that we will be able to arrange credit on terms we believe are acceptable or that permit us to finance our business with historical margins a lack of credit could have an adverse impact on certain of our suppliers landlords and other tenants in retail centers in which we are located if these issues occur they could negatively affect our financial results any new disruptions in the financial markets may also adversely affect the us and world economy which could negatively impact consumer spending patterns 

impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment of goodwill exists factors may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and slower growth rates any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations we compute the amount of impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of that reporting unit we are required to record a noncash impairment charge if the testing performed indicates that goodwill has been impaired 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets primarily the longhorn steakhouse ®  cheddar’s scratch kitchen ®  the capital grille ®  yard house ® and eddie v’s prime seafood ® trademarks to determine if they are definite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

as with goodwill we test our indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairments of these or other assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results 

we are primarily subject to income and other taxes in the united states our effective income tax rate and other taxes in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws or other legislative changes and the outcome of income tax audits although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of a tax audit could have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made in addition our effective income tax rate and our results may be impacted by our ability to realize deferred tax benefits and by any increases or decreases of our valuation allowances applied to our existing deferred tax assets 

failure of our internal controls over financial reporting and future changes in accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results affect our reported results of operations or otherwise harm our business and financial results 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud our growth and acquisition of other restaurant companies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud a significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation 

a change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future changes to existing accounting rules or the application of current accounting practices may adversely affect our reported financial results additionally our assumptions estimates and judgments related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including but not limited to revenue recognition fair value of investments impairment of longlived assets leases and related economic transactions derivatives pension and postretirement benefits intangibles selfinsurance income taxes property and equipment unclaimed property laws and litigation and stockbased compensation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by us changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance

covid19 pandemic and other impacts to our operating environment 

for much of fiscal 2021 the covid19 pandemic resulted in a significant reduction in guest traffic at our restaurants due to changes in consumer behavior as public health officials encouraged social distancing and required personal protective equipment also some state and local governments mandated restrictions including suspension of dinein operations reduced restaurant seating capacity table spacing requirements bar closures and additional physical barriers once covid19 vaccines were approved and moved into wider distribution in the united states in early 2021 public health conditions improved and almost all of the covid19 restrictions on businesses eased 

during fiscal 2022 increases in the number of cases of covid19 throughout the united states including the omicron variant which significantly impacted our restaurants in the third quarter mostly in january 2022 subjected some of our restaurants to other covid19related restrictions such as mask andor vaccine requirements for team members guests or both exclusions and quarantines of restaurant team members or groups thereof disrupt an individual restaurant’s operations and often come with little or no notice to the local restaurant management during fiscal 2022 along with covid19 our operating results were impacted by geopolitical and other macroeconomic events leading to higher than usual inflation on wages and other cost of goods sold these events further impacted the availability of team members needed to staff our restaurants and caused additional disruptions in our product supply chain 

the ongoing effects of covid19 and its variants along with other geopolitical and macroeconomic events could lead to further capacity restrictions mask and vaccination mandates wage inflation staffing challenges product cost inflation and disruptions in the supply chain that impact our restaurants’ ability to obtain the products needed to support their operations 

fiscal 2022 financial highlights 

• total sales increased 338 to 963 billion in 2022 from 720 billion in fiscal 2021 driven by a blended samerestaurant sales increase of 309 and sales from 33 net new restaurants

fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 

• food and beverage costs increased as a percent of sales primarily due to a 25 impact from inflation partially offset by a 09 impact from pricing

income taxes 

the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2022 and 2021 for continuing operations were 127 percent and 97 percent respectively during fiscal 2022 we had income tax expense of 1388 million on earnings before income tax of 109 billion compared to an income tax benefit of 559 million on earnings before income taxes of 5765 million in fiscal 2021 the change was driven primarily by an increase in earnings before income taxes in fiscal 2022 in addition to the generation of a net operating loss for tax purposes in fiscal 2021 that was carried back to the previous five tax years an income tax benefit was generated due to the difference in federal tax rates between fiscal year 2021 and the years to which the federal net operating loss was carried back

segment results 

we manage our restaurant brands olive garden longhorn steakhouse cheddar’s scratch kitchen yard house the capital grille seasons 52 bahama breeze eddie v’s and the capital burger in the us and canada as operating segments we aggregate our operating segments into reportable segments based on a combination of the size economic characteristics and subsegment of fullservice dining within which each brand operates our four reportable segments are 1 olive garden 2 longhorn steakhouse 3 fine dining and 4 other business in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we changed our internal management reporting to include the capital burger in the other business segment previously the capital burger was included in the fine dining segment due to its adjacency with the capital grille brand and overall immateriality fiscal 2021 figures have been restated for comparability see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report for further details 

our management uses segment profit as the measure for assessing performance of our segments the following table presents segment profit margin for the periods indicated 



the decrease in the olive garden segment profit margin for fiscal 2022 was driven primarily by higher restaurant labor and food and beverage costs offset by lower restaurant expenses the decrease in the longhorn steakhouse segment profit margin for fiscal 2022 was driven primarily by higher food and beverage costs offset by lower restaurant expenses the increase in the fine dining segment profit margin for fiscal 2022 was driven primarily by lower restaurant expenses and restaurant labor offset by higher food and beverage costs the increase in the other business segment profit margin for fiscal 2022 was driven by lower restaurant expenses offset by higher food and beverage costs 

results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

for a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended may 30 2021 and may 31 2020 see “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended may 30 2021 filed with the sec on july 23 2021 

seasonality 

our sales volumes have historically fluctuated seasonally typically our average sales per restaurant are highest in the winter and spring followed by the summer and lowest in the fall holidays changes in the economy severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions because of the historical seasonality of our business and these other factors results for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

impact of inflation 

we attempt to minimize the annual effects of inflation through appropriate planning operating practices and menu price increases we are currently operating in a period of higher than usual inflation led by food and beverage cost and labor inflation food and beverage inflation is principally due to increased costs incurred by our vendors related to higher labor transportation packaging and raw materials costs some of the impacts of the inflation have been offset by menu price increases and other adjustments made during the year whether we are able andor choose to continue to offset the effects of inflation will determine to what extent if any inflation affects our restaurant profitability in future periods 

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions we consider the following estimates to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

leases 

we evaluate our leases at their inception to estimate their expected term which commences on the date when we have the right to control the use of the leased property and includes the noncancelable base term plus all option periods we are reasonably certain to exercise our judgment in determining the appropriate expected term and discount rate for each lease affects our evaluation of 

• the classification and accounting for leases as operating versus finance 

• the rent holidays and escalation in payments that are included in the calculation of the lease liability and related rightofuse asset and 

• the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant facility are amortized 

these judgments may produce materially different amounts of lease liabilities and rightofuse assets recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as well as depreciation amortization interest and rent expense recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings if different discount rates and expected lease terms were used

land buildings and equipment operating lease rightofuse assets and certain other assets including definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows changes in expected useful life unanticipated competition slower growth rates ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets or changes in the usage or operating performance any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements based on a review of operating results for each of our restaurants given the current operating environment the amount of net book value associated with lower performing restaurants that would be deemed at risk for impairment is not material to our consolidated financial statements 

valuation and recoverability of goodwill and trademarks 

goodwill and trademarks are not subject to amortization and goodwill has been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing the reporting units are our restaurant brands a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and slower growth rates any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements we review our goodwill and trademarks for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 

during fiscal 2022 we elected to perform a qualitative assessment for our annual impairment review of goodwill and trademarks to determine whether or not indicators of impairment exist in considering the qualitative approach related to goodwill we evaluated factors including but not limited to covid19 macroeconomic conditions market and industry conditions commodity cost fluctuations competitive environment share price performance results of prior impairment tests operational stability the overall financial performance of the reporting units and the impacts of discount rates as it relates to trademarks we evaluate similar factors from the goodwill assessment in addition to impacts of royalty rates based on the results of the qualitative assessment which considered the improvements of each of our brands’ financial performance as well as the improved overall operating environment no indicators of impairment were identified changes in circumstances existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future or in the numerous estimates associated with management’s judgments and assumptions made in assessing the fair value of our goodwill and trademarks could result in an impairment loss of a portion or all of our goodwill or trademarks 

impairment of our assets including goodwill or trademarks adversely affects our financial position and results of operations and our leverage ratio for purposes of our revolving credit agreement revolving credit agreement increases a leverage ratio exceeding the maximum permitted under our revolving credit agreement would be a default under our revolving credit agreement at may 29 2022 additional writedowns of goodwill other indefinitelived intangible assets or any other assets in excess of approximately 103 billion would have been required to cause our leverage ratio to exceed the permitted maximum as our leverage ratio is determined on a quarterly basis and due to the seasonal nature of our business a lesser amount of impairment in future quarters could cause our leverage ratio to exceed the permitted maximum 

unearned revenues 

unearned revenues primarily represent our liability for gift cards that have been sold but not yet redeemed the estimated value of gift cards expected to remain unused is recognized over the expected period of redemption as the remaining gift card values are redeemed generally over a period of 12 years utilizing this method we estimate both the amount of breakage and the time period of redemption if actual redemption patterns vary from our estimates actual gift card breakage income may differ from the amounts recorded we update our estimates of our redemption period and our breakage rate periodically and apply that rate to gift card redemptions on a prospective basis changing our breakagerate estimates by 50 basis points would have resulted in an adjustment in our breakage income of approximately 31 million for fiscal 2022 

income taxes 

we estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes these estimates include among other items depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported employee tip income effective rates for state and local income taxes and the tax deductibility of certain other items we adjust our annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available 

assessment of uncertain tax positions requires judgments relating to the amounts timing and likelihood of resolution as described in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report the 222 million balance of unrecognized tax benefits at may 29 2022 includes 58 million related to tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts could change during the next 12 months based on the outcome of examinations of the 58 million 37 million relates to items that would impact our effective income tax rate 

liquidity and capital resources 

typically cash flows generated from operating activities are our principal source of liquidity which we use to finance capital expenditures for new restaurants and to remodel and maintain existing restaurants to pay dividends to our shareholders and to repurchase shares of our common stock since substantially all of our sales are for cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable are generally paid in 5 to 90 days we are typically able to carry current liabilities in excess of current assets 

we currently manage our business and financial ratios to target an investmentgrade bond rating which has historically allowed flexible access to financing at reasonable costs our publicly issued longterm debt currently carries the following ratings 

• moody’s investors service “baa2” 

• standard  poor’s “bbb” and 

• fitch “bbb” 

our commercial paper has ratings of 

• moody’s investors service “p2”

these ratings are as of the date of the filing of this report and have been obtained with the understanding that moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch will continue to monitor our credit and make future adjustments to these ratings to the extent warranted the ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our securities may be changed superseded or withdrawn at any time and should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

on september 10 2021 we entered into a 1 billion revolving credit agreement revolving credit agreement with bank of america na boa as administrative agent and the lenders and other agents party thereto the revolving credit agreement is a senior unsecured credit commitment to the company and contains customary representations and affirmative and negative covenants including limitations on liens and subsidiary debt and a maximum consolidated lease adjusted total debt to total capitalization ratio of 075 to 100 and events of default usual for credit facilities of this type the revolving credit agreement replaced our prior 7500 million revolving credit agreement dated as of october 27 2017 and amended as of march 25 2020 as of may 29 2022 we had no outstanding balances and we were in compliance with all covenants under the revolving credit agreement 

the revolving credit agreement matures on september 10 2026 and the proceeds may be used for working capital and capital expenditures the refinancing of certain indebtedness certain acquisitions and general corporate purposes loans under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at a rate of libor plus a margin determined by reference to a ratingsbased pricing grid applicable margin or the base rate which is defined as the highest of the boa prime rate the federal funds rate plus 0500 percent and the eurodollar rate plus 100 percent plus the applicable margin assuming a “bbb” equivalent credit rating level the applicable margin under the revolving credit agreement will be 1000 percent for libor loans and 0000 percent for base rate loans 

as of may 29 2022 our outstanding longterm debt consisted principally of 

• 5000 million of unsecured 3850 percent senior notes due in may 2027

the interest rate on our 428 million 6800 percent senior notes due october 2037 is subject to adjustment from time to time if the debt rating assigned to such series of notes is downgraded below a certain rating level or subsequently upgraded the maximum adjustment is 2000 percent above the initial interest rate and the interest rate cannot be reduced below the initial interest rate as of may 29 2022 no such adjustments are made to this rate 

through our shelf registration statement on file with the sec depending on conditions prevailing in the public capital markets we may issue equity securities or unsecured debt securities from time to time in one or more series which may consist of notes debentures or other evidences of indebtedness in one or more offerings 

from time to time we may repurchase our outstanding debt in privately negotiated transactions such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements and other factors 

from time to time we enter into interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk inherent in our operations see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report 

a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at may 29 2022 is as follows 



1 includes interest payments associated with existing longterm debt excludes discount and issuance costs of 101 million

our adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio was 61 percent and 55 percent as of may 29 2022 and may 30 2021 respectively based on these ratios we believe our financial condition is strong we include the leasedebt equivalent and contractual lease guarantees in our adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio reported to shareholders as we believe its inclusion better represents the optimal capital structure that we target from period to period and because it is consistent with the calculation of the covenant under our revolving credit agreement for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 the leasedebt equivalent includes 600 times the total annual minimum rent for consolidated lease obligations of 4098 million and 3857 million respectively the composition of our capital structure is shown in the following table 



net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations were 126 billion and 119 billion in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively net cash flows provided by operating activities include net earnings from continuing operations of 9547 million in fiscal 2022 and 6324 million in fiscal 2021 net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased in fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher net earnings from continuing operations 

net cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations were 3890 million and 2637 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively capital expenditures incurred principally for building new restaurants remodeling existing restaurants replacing equipment and technology initiatives were 3769 million in fiscal 2022 compared to 2549 million in fiscal 2021

our defined benefit and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are determined using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies prescribed under financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic 715 compensation  retirement benefits and topic 712 compensation  nonretirement postemployment benefits we expect to contribute approximately 04 million to our supplemental defined benefit pension plan and approximately 19 million to our postretirement benefit plan during fiscal 2023 

we are not aware of any trends or events that would materially affect our capital requirements or liquidity we believe that our internal cashgenerating capabilities the potential issuance of equity or unsecured debt securities under our shelf registration statement and shortterm commercial paper or drawings under our revolving credit agreement should be sufficient to finance our capital expenditures debt maturities and other operating activities through fiscal 2023 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are not a party to any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition sales or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

financial condition 

our total current assets were 118 billion at may 29 2022 compared with 187 billion at may 30 2021 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents driven by increased share repurchases in fiscal 2022 

our total current liabilities were 185 billion at may 29 2022 and may 30 2021 decreases in other current liabilities were offset by increases in accounts payable and unearned revenues associated with gift card sales in excess of gift card redemptions

covid19 pandemic 

for much of fiscal 2021 the covid19 pandemic resulted in a significant reduction in guest traffic at our restaurants due to changes in consumer behavior as public health officials encouraged social distancing and required personal protective equipment and state and local governments mandated restrictions including suspension of dinein operations reduced restaurant seating capacity table spacing requirements bar closures and additional physical barriers beginning in late march 2020 we operated with all of our dining rooms closed and served our guests in a to go only or to go and delivery format in late april 2020 state and local governments began to allow us to open dining rooms at limited capacities along with other operating restrictions 

as a result we began fiscal 2021 with significant limitations on our operations which over the course of the fiscal year varied widely from time to time state to state and city to city during november 2020 rising case rates resulted in certain jurisdictions implementing restrictions that again reduced dining room capacity or mandated the reclosure of dining rooms once covid19 vaccines were approved and moved into wider distribution in the united states in early 2021 public health conditions improved and almost all of the covid19 restrictions on businesses have eased as of the date of this report all of our restaurants were able to open their dining rooms to some extent and few capacity restrictions or other covid19 restrictions remained in place in the united states however it is possible additional outbreaks could require us to again reduce our capacity or limit or suspend our inrestaurant dining operations 

as we navigated through the pandemic we took significant steps to adapt our business model to allow us to continue to serve guests and support our team members including investing in our team members through enhanced pay and benefits streamlining our restaurant processes simplifying our menus and accelerating the rollout of technology to all of our brands to enhance the offpremise and inrestaurant guest experience as our dining rooms have returned to full or closetofull capacity we are focused on continuing to provide a safe environment for our team members and guests and maintaining many of the operating efficiencies established during fiscal 2021

strategy 

we believe that capable operators of strong multiunit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the restaurant industry’s fullservice segment generally the restaurant industry is considered to be comprised of three segments quick service fast casual and fullservice all of our restaurants fall within the fullservice segment which is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains we believe we have strong brands and that the breadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the fullservice restaurant industry this collective capability is the product of investments over many years in areas that are critical to success in our business including restaurant operations excellence brand management excellence supply chain talent management and information technology among other things 

although throughout fiscal 2021 we continued to adapt our business model to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic our operating philosophy remains focused on strengthening the core operational fundamentals of the business by providing an outstanding guest experience rooted in culinary innovation attentive service engaging atmosphere and integrated marketing darden enables each brand to reach its full potential by leveraging its scale insights and experience in a way that protects uniqueness and competitive advantages additionally our brands can capitalize on data driven insights to deliver customized onetoone customer relationship marketing we hold ourselves accountable for operating our restaurants with a sense of urgency to achieve our commitments to all of our stakeholders 

recent and planned restaurant growth

4 fiscal 2021 restaurant openings include one the capital burger restaurant proforma new restaurant data excludes the capital burger 

while our objective is to continue to expand all of our restaurant brands the actual number of openings for each of our brands for fiscal 2022 will depend on many factors including our ability to recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel locate appropriate sites negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms obtain necessary local governmental permits and complete construction 

we consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant’s longterm success and we devote significant effort to the site selection process prior to entering a market we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors these factors include trade area demographics such as target population density and household income levels competitive influences in the trade area the site’s visibility accessibility and traffic volume and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls hotelmotel complexes offices and universities members of senior management evaluate inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after the site is acquired and permits are obtained 

we systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards when a restaurant falls below minimum standards we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes and implement operational and marketing plans to improve that restaurant’s performance if performance does not improve to acceptable levels the restaurant is evaluated for relocation closing or conversion to one of our other brands permanent closures are typically due to economic changes in trade areas the expiration of lease agreements or site concerns accordingly we continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges 

restaurant operations 

we believe that highquality restaurant management is critical to our longterm success our restaurant management structure varies by brand and restaurant size we issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards 

the management structures below describe our restaurant operations during the normal and fully operational conditions that were in place at the end of fiscal 2021 over the course of fiscal 2021 as the covid19 pandemic impacted our business the staffing levels of each our restaurants changed frequently as our dining rooms operated under a range of capacity limitations that also varied from time to time from state to state and city to city as our restaurant operations continued to evolve in response to the pandemic we have evolved our operational structure and made adjustments to restaurant staffing where appropriate as a result the descriptions below may not reflect the current or future structure of our restaurant operations 

each olive garden restaurant is led by a general manager and each longhorn steakhouse and cheddar’s scratch kitchen restaurant is led by a managing partner each also has three to six additional managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant in addition each restaurant typically employs between 35 to 200 hourly team members most of whom work parttime restaurant general managers or managing partners report to a director of operations who is responsible for approximately five to eleven restaurants each director of operations reports to a senior vice president of operations who is responsible for between 80 and 120 restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by operations management including officer level executives to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards and to solicit feedback on opportunities for improvement 

each yard house and bahama breeze restaurant is led by a general manager and each the capital grille seasons 52 and eddie v’s restaurant is led by a managing partner each has four to ten managers each yard house the capital grille seasons 52 and eddie v’s restaurant has one executive chef and one to two sous chefs and each bahama breeze restaurant has one to three culinary managers in addition each restaurant typically employs between 65 to 200 hourly team members most of whom work parttime the general manager or managing partner of each restaurant reports directly to a director of operations who has operational responsibility for approximately three to eleven restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by operations management including officer level executives to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards and to solicit feedback on opportunities for improvement 

our learning and employee development team in partnership with each brand’s training leader together with senior operations executives is responsible for developing and maintaining our operations training programs these efforts include an eight to twelveweek training program for management trainees and continuing development programs for all levels of leadership the emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant brand but includes leadership restaurant business management and culinary skills we also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants including deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations the opening training teams typically begin work one and a half weeks prior to opening and remain at the new restaurant for up to three weeks after the opening they are redeployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant’s operating staff 

we maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our managementlevel team members we believe that our leadership position strong resultsoriented culture and various shortterm and longterm incentive programs including stockbased compensation enhances our ability to attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers 

quality assurance 

our total quality department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe highquality food in a clean and safe environment 

food safety and our total quality program 

through rigorous supplier and riskbased product evaluations we purchase only products that meet or exceed our product specifications we rely on independent third parties to inspect and evaluate our suppliers and distributors suppliers that produce “highrisk” products are subject to a food safety evaluation by darden personnel at least annually we require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive hazard analysis and critical control point haccp food safety programs and riskbased preventative controls adopted by the us food and drug administration these programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause foodborne illnesses by applying scientificallybased controls to analyze hazards identify and monitor critical control points and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met 

third party auditors inspect each restaurant regularly throughout the year to assess food safety and sanitation practices our total quality team verifies the application of preventative controls through onsite support visits ensuring an effective and robust food safety system total quality managers provide support to operations staff with education and training in food safety and sanitation the team also serves as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety 

restaurant guest and team member safety in response to covid19 

in response to the covid19 pandemic throughout fiscal 2021 we have enhanced restaurant safety practices and made other enhancements to our operations to comply with state and local government regulations and health recommendations to ensure guest and team member wellness maintain clean restaurants practice social distancing and wear protective equipment as the pandemic recedes in the united states many of the additional covid19 protocols have been relaxed or removed as of the date of this report nevertheless we are remaining vigilant and may reinstate any of the additional safety or health and wellness precautions if public health conditions worsen in any of our service areas or future government regulations require us to do so 

purchasing and distribution 

our ability to ensure a consistent supply of safe highquality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant brands depends on reliable sources of procurement our purchasing staff sources negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 1500 suppliers whose products originate in more than 35 countries suppliers must meet our requirements and strict quality control standards in the development harvest catch and production of food products competitive bids longterm contracts and strategic supplier relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products 

in response to the covid19 pandemic throughout fiscal 2021 we took several steps to enhance the safety and reliability of our supply chain 

• safety  the company’s cross functional covid19 task force implemented cdcbased guidelines for restaurants we also implemented and communicated guidelines for our distributors and other suppliers providing services inside our restaurants including required use of personal protective equipment ppe to support these enhanced safety protocols we secured a supply of the necessary volumes of ppe and cleaning products for our restaurants and team members 

• sourcing as we transitioned to increased to go business during the temporary closure of our dining rooms we secured supplies of new and additional packaging products to better support food and beverage transport we also sourced alternate formats of alcohol beverages for to go in order to comply with state laws that permitted to go sales of alcohol to mitigate the potential risk of geographic trade disruptions we created contingency plans in anticipation of supply chain obstacles the purchasing team also mitigated obsoleteexpiring inventory exposure by selling products to retail outlets for slowmoving items during capacity and dining room restrictions 

• distribution  we increased inventory levels for brandcritical items restaurant cleaning products and ppe supplies to ensure sufficient supply of necessary products an internal crossfunctional team was created specifically to ensure successful restaurant rampdown and quick reopening support 

we believe that our significant scale is a competitive advantage and our purchasing team leverages this purchasing capability our purchasing staff travels routinely within the united states and internationally to source topquality food products at competitive prices during the covid19 pandemic we are monitoring our suppliers remotely hosting virtual visits with potential new suppliers and conducting virtual request for proposal processes we believe that we have established excellent longterm relationships with key suppliers and usually source our product directly from producers not brokers or middlemen we actively support several national minority supplier organizations to ensure that we incorporate women and minorityowned businesses in our purchasing decisions 

we have entered into longterm agreements with multiple thirdparty national distribution companies to deliver food and supplies to our restaurants under these arrangements we maintain ownership of the food and supplies inventory through our subsidiary darden direct distribution inc darden direct this inventory is stored in distribution company warehouses that are wholly or primarily dedicated to darden where practical to do so because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales 

we continue to drive automation of our supply chain by collaborating with our suppliers logistics partners and distributors to improve optimization with information visibility and other technological advances these and other terms of darden direct’s longterm supply agreements further enable our purchasing staff to integrate demand forecasts into our purchasing operations driving efficiencies in our operations 

advertising and marketing 

integrated marketing is a key element of our strategy and our scale enables us to be a leading advertiser in the fullservice dining segment of the restaurant industry olive garden leverages the efficiency of national advertising on both traditional and streaming television supplemented with additional targeted digital media investments longhorn steakhouse uses local television and digital advertising to build engagement and loyalty by market cheddar’s scratch kitchen yard house the capital grille seasons 52 bahama breeze and eddie v’s do not use television advertising but rely on local and digital marketing in response to the covid19 pandemic we significantly reduced our television advertising spending and directed our marketing efforts towards growing and promoting our to go options and offpremise dining business for much of fiscal 2021 our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to build awareness and strengthen our brands’ relevance we implement periodic promotions as appropriate to increase frequency of guest visits while maintaining overall profitability we also rely on outdoor billboard direct mail and email advertising as well as radio newspapers digital coupons search engine marketing and social media such as facebook® and instagram® as appropriate to attract engage and retain our guests we have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor guest satisfaction and evolving food service trends and marketplace dynamics 

in fiscal 2021 we continued a multiyear effort to implement new technology platforms that allow us to digitally engage with our guests and team members and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities in an increasingly connected society we also continued making improvements to our online and mobile ordering system for olive garden and longhorn steakhouse and accelerated rollout of online and mobile ordering and payment systems across all of our other brands in addition we continued working on developing sophisticated customer relationship management programs data analytics and datadriven marketing approaches to effectively and efficiently target our existing and potential guests across our portfolio of brands this enables us to tailor our messaging and offerings depending on guest visit history preferences and brand loyalty 

human capital 

darden prioritizes our team members through our people strategy that includes four strategic imperatives 

• hire  attract and select diverse team members that reflect our values and are committed to our resultsoriented culture 

• train  teach our team members to perform in today’s environment and develop the skills to meet tomorrow’s needs 

• reward  invest in compelling programs that recognize team members when goals are achieved and further motivate our culture of winning and 

• retain  we keep our team members engaged and motivated ready to deliver results and grow their careers 

we closely track and assess a variety of metrics that help us to evaluate our performance of each of these imperatives 

hire we are committed to attracting retaining engaging and developing a workforce that mirrors the diversity of our guests we track a variety of workforce statistics to help us understand the gender racial and ethnic diversity of our team members including the following 

key team member statistics as of the end of fiscal 2021 



in addition to the gender racial and ethnic diversity of our workforce our team members are also very diverse in age we employ members of five generations of the united states population traditionalists baby boomers generation x millennials and centennials we provide our eeo1 report and additional details about our inclusion and diversity programs on our website at wwwdardencom 

train we succeed because of our people and with our success come rewards recognition and great opportunities for our team members we invest in our team members’ careers every step of the way by providing the tools they need to succeed in 

their current roles to grow personally and professionally and to deliver exceptional experiences to our guests each day with thousands of leadership positions across our restaurants we provide a pathway and training for thousands of individuals across the country to advance from entrylevel jobs into management roles 65 of the participants in our restaurant manager in training program in fiscal 2021 were internal promotions and 100 of the new general managers or managing partners during fiscal 2021 were internal promotions 

reward we believe that we provide working conditions and pay and benefits that compare favorably with those of our competitors most team members other than restaurant management and corporate management are paid on an hourly basis we offer our team members flexible work schedules and competitive pay and benefits including paid sick leave and access to free counseling through our work life assistance program for team members and their family in march of 2021 we announced that every hourly restaurant team member companywide would earn a minimum hourly wage of at least 10 per hour inclusive of tip income starting immediately and we committed to increase that minimum wage to 11 per hour in january 2022 and 12 per hour in january 2023 we also announced approximately 17 million in onetime bonuses that were paid to our hourly restaurant team members to reward them for their hard work and dedication to serving our guests throughout the covid19 pandemic during fiscal 2021 we provided nearly 24 million in supplemental pay programs to provide support to hourly team members impacted by closures of dining rooms due to the covid19 pandemic and paid time off to receive their covid19 vaccines in addition to reward our restaurant management teams during fiscal 2021 we paid quarterly bonuses at abovetarget levels regardless of performance during those quarters for our restaurant management teams other than general managers or managing partners we also announced 65 million in onetime bonuses to reward their contributions to our success in navigating the pandemic none of our team members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our team member relations to be good 

consistent with our core values of respect caring and teamwork in fiscal 1999 we established a program called darden dimes to help fellow darden team members in need darden dimes provides shortterm financial grants to team members experiencing financial need caused by unexpected emergencies or catastrophic natural disasters participating team members donate as little as 10 cents from each paycheck to the darden dimes fund which raises and grants approximately 14 million annually 

retain as a fullservice restaurant company food is always top of mind but our team members make the difference they are at the heart of everything we do we believe the guest experience can never exceed the team member experience so we hire the best and retain them by fostering an environment of respect where diversity of thought and background is valued and everyone has the opportunity to develop and grow their careers in addition our geographic footprint often puts us in a position to offer our restaurant team members jobs in their current roles when personal circumstances require relocation 

despite impacts of covid19 on our business and our workforce darden’s consolidated turnover rate for hourly team members during fiscal 2021 was 954 one of the lowest rates in the restaurant industry each of our brands experienced a turnover rate during fiscal 2021 that was lower than the most recent relevant casual dining or fine dining turnover rate for their industry as reported in the people report tm by black box intelligence tm  darden’s consolidated restaurant management turnover rate of 188 was also significantly lower than the industry benchmark and an improvement over fiscal 2020 our executive leadership vice president and above has an average of over 16 years of experience with darden the restaurant general managers and managing partners average 13 years with us 

information technology and cybersecurity 

we strive for leadership in the restaurant business by using technology as a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy we have implemented technologyenabled business solutions to improve financial control cost management guest service and employee effectiveness as well as enable ecommerce these solutions are designed to be used across restaurant brands yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant brand our strategy is to fully integrate systems to drive operational efficiencies and enable restaurant teams to focus on restaurant operations excellence restaurant hardware and software support for all of our restaurant brands is provided or coordinated from the restaurant support center facility in orlando florida our data center contains sufficient computing power to process information from all restaurants quickly and efficiently our information is processed in a secure environment to protect both our data and the physical computing assets we guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan which includes storing critical business information offsite testing the disaster recovery plan at a hostsite facility and providing onsite power backup we periodically perform thirdparty cybersecurity audits following the standard set by the national institute of standards and technology we also conduct thirdparty security reviews of our network processes and systems on a regular basis we use internally developed proprietary software cloudbased software as a service saas as well as purchased software with proven nonproprietary hardware 

all darden brands share a secure robust digital platform with online ordering and other guestfacing capabilities we also have deployed mobile applications with online ordering and other features for all of our casual dining brands and for most of our specialty restaurant brands we successfully leveraged these digital capabilities over the last year to address changing guest needs we will continue to invest in these platforms and applications to enhance the guest experience 

we maintain a robust system of data protection and cybersecurity resources technology and processes we regularly evaluate new and emerging risks and everchanging legal and compliance requirements we make strategic investments to address these risks and compliance requirements to keep company guest and team member data secure we monitor risks of sensitive information compromise at our business partners where relevant and reevaluate the risks at these partners periodically we also perform annual and ongoing cybersecurity awareness training for our management and restaurant support center team members in addition we provide annual credit card handling training following payment card industry pci guidelines to all team members that handle guest credit cards 

our management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates positions us well to support current needs and future growth we use a strategic information systems multiyear planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning we provide data protection and cybersecurity reports to the audit committee of the company’s board of directors on a quarterly basis and periodically to the full board of directors information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic financial regulatory risk and other business advantage criteria 

competition 

the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food price service restaurant location personnel brand attractiveness of facilities availability of carryout and home delivery internet and mobile ordering capabilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing the restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing restaurants and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power we compete within each market with national and regional chains and locallyowned restaurants for guests management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites we also face growing competition from the supermarket industry which offers convenient meals in the form of improved entrées side dishes or meal preparation kits from the deli or prepared foods sections in addition improving product offerings at fast casual restaurants and quickservice restaurants and expansion of home delivery services together with negative economic conditions could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives we expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas 

other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled “purchasing and distribution” “advertising and marketing” and “information technology and cybersecurity” in this item 1 and in our risk factors in item 1a of this form 10k

seasonality 

our sales volumes have historically fluctuated seasonally typically our average sales per restaurant are highest in the winter and spring followed by the summer and lowest in the fall however throughout fiscal 2021 a variety of factors including the impacts of covid19 on our business government actions taken to respond to covid19 and to stimulate the united states’ recovery from covid19 and changing consumer preferences caused fluctuations in our sales volumes that were different than our typical seasonality additionally holidays changes in the economy severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions because of the historical seasonality of our business and these other factors results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year

in addition to the novel coronavirus that causes covid19 the united states and other countries have experienced or may experience in the future outbreaks of other viruses such as norovirus avian flu or “sars” “mers” h1n1 or “swine flu” or other diseases to the extent that a virus or disease is foodborne or perceived to be foodborne future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product or could reduce public confidence in food handling andor public assembly for example public concern over avian flu may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry the inability to serve poultrybased products would restrict our ability to provide a variety of menu items to our guests if we change a restaurant menu in response to such concerns we may lose guests who do not prefer the new menu and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new guest base to produce the sales needed to make the restaurant profitable we also may have different or additional competitors for our intended guests as a result of such a change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors if a virus is transmitted by human contact or respiratory transmission our employees or guests could become infected or could choose or be advised to avoid gathering in public places any of which could adversely affect our restaurant guest traffic and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level we also could be adversely affected if the world health organization andor the cdc were to restrict travel to affected geographic areas where we source our products thus possibly impacting the continuity of supply additionally jurisdictions in which we have restaurants may impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may cause guests to choose other alternatives to dining out in our restaurants which may adversely affect our business 

a failure to maintain food safety throughout the supply chain and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

food safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe quality food products even with strong preventative interventions and controls food safety issues could be caused at the source or by food suppliers or distributors and as a result be out of our control and require prompt action to mitigate impact in addition regardless of the source or cause any report of foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a norovirus or salmonella or other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination at one of our restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our brands and have a negative impact on our sales even instances of foodborne illness food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients resulting in higher costs and lower margins 

risks related to human capital 

the inability to hire train reward and retain restaurant team members and determine and maintain adequate staffing may impact our ability to achieve our operating growth and financial objectives 

our longterm growth depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain highquality team members to work in and manage our restaurants adequate staffing and retention of qualified restaurant team members is a critical factor impacting our guests’ experience in our restaurants maintaining adequate staffing in our existing restaurants and hiring and training staff for our new restaurants requires precise workforce planning which has been complicated by the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our business the relevant labor market and on consumer preferences the market for the most qualified talent continues to be competitive and we must provide competitive wages benefits and workplace conditions to maintain our most qualified team members personal or public health concerns related to covid19 may continue to make some existing team members or potential candidates reluctant to work in enclosed restaurant environments we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges in recruiting and retaining team members in various locations a shortage of quality candidates who meet all legal citizenship or work authorization requirements failure to recruit and retain new team members in a timely manner or higher than expected turnover levels all could affect our ability to open new restaurants grow sales at existing restaurants or meet our labor cost objectives an inability to adequately monitor and proactively respond to team member dissatisfaction could lead to poor guest satisfaction higher turnover litigation and unionization which could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

a failure to recruit develop and retain effective leaders or the loss or shortage of personnel with key capacities and skills could impact our strategic direction and jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets 

our future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other leadership team members we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management team members in order to achieve our current business objectives and support our projected growth changes in senior management could expose us to significant changes in strategic direction and initiatives a failure to maintain appropriate organizational capacity and capability to support leadership excellence adequate resources innovative skill sets and expectations and build adequate bench strength required for growth or a loss of key skill sets could jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets 

we may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs 

our restaurant operations are subject to united states and canadian federal state and local laws governing such matters as minimum wages working conditions overtime and tip credits as federal state and local minimum wage rates increase we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage labor shortages increased employee turnover and health care and other benefit mandates also have increased and may continue to increase our labor costs this in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales conversely if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices our profitability may decline in addition the current premiums that we pay for our insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property health and directors’ and officers’ liability may increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs the dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers’ compensation and general liability insurance for which we carry high perclaim deductibles may also increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs further the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses 

risks relating to information technology and privacy 

we rely heavily on information technology in our operations and insufficient guest or employee facing technology or a failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network free from material failure interruption or security breach could harm our ability to effectively operate our business andor result in the loss of respected relationships with our guests or employees 

we rely heavily on information systems across our operations including for ecommerce marketing programs employee engagement management of our supply chain the pointofsale processing system in our restaurants and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability security and capacity of these systems in addition we must effectively respond to changing guest expectations and new technological developments disruptions failures or other performance issues with guest facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our business and negatively affect our relationship with our guests the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems a material network breach in the security of these systems as a result of a cyber attack phishing attack ransomware attack or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to the company our team members or guests this could include the theft of our intellectual property trade secrets or sensitive financial information some of these essential business processes that are dependent on technology are outsourced to third parties while we make efforts to ensure that our providers are observing proper standards and controls we cannot guarantee that breaches or failures caused by these outsourced providers will not occur 

any such failures or disruptions may cause delays in guest service reduce efficiency in our operations require significant capital investments to remediate the problem result in customer employee or advertiser dissatisfaction or otherwise result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation we could also be subjected to litigation regulatory investigations or the imposition of penalties as information security laws and regulations change and cyber risks evolve we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance and protect guest employee and company information 

we may incur increased costs to comply with privacy and data protection laws and if we fail to comply or our systems are compromised we could be subject to government enforcement actions private litigation and adverse publicity 

we receive and maintain certain personal financial and other information about our customers employees vendors and suppliers in addition certain of our vendors receive and maintain certain personal financial and other information about our employees and customers the use and handling including security of this information is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding data privacy laws and regulations in various jurisdictions as well as by certain thirdparty contracts and industry standards complying with newly developed laws and regulations which are subject to change and uncertain interpretations and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction may lead to a decline in guest engagement or cause us to incur substantial costs or modifications to our operations or business practices to comply in addition if our security and information systems are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss cyber attack or a network security incident or if our employees or vendors fail to comply with these laws and regulations or fail to meet industry standards and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately it could result in liabilities and penalties and could damage our reputation cause interruption of normal business performance cause us to incur substantial costs and result in a loss of customer confidence which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition additionally we could be subject to litigation and government enforcement actions as a result of any such failure 

risks related to the restaurant industry 

we are subject to a number of risks relating to public policy changes and federal state and local regulation of our business including in the areas of health care reform environmental matters minimum wage unionization menu labeling immigration requirements and taxes and an insufficient or ineffective response to legislation or government regulation may impact our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability 

the restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal state local and international laws and regulations the development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites which are subject to building zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations and requirements we are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health sanitation safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food including regulations regarding product safety nutritional content and menu labeling we are subject to federal state and local laws governing employment practices and working conditions these laws cover minimum wage rates wage and hour practices labor relations paid and family leave workplace safety and immigration among others the myriad of laws and regulations being passed at the state and local level creates unique challenges for a multistate employer as different standards apply to different locations sometimes with conflicting requirements we must continue to monitor and adapt our employment practices to comply with these various laws and regulations 

we also are subject to federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities such as the ada compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation new or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our labor costs 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge emission and disposal of hazardous materials there also has been increasing focus by united states and overseas governmental authorities on other environmental matters such as climate change the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption this increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating a yet to be specified array of environmental matters legislative regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials taxes transportation and utilities which could decrease our operating profits and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment 

we are subject to laws relating to information security cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and any failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws or any breach of our systems could harm our reputation or lead to litigation which could adversely affect our financial condition 

the impact of current laws and regulations the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues could negatively impact our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal state and local authorities could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings 

we face intense competition and if we have an insufficient focus on competition and the consumer landscape our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the fullservice dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing service location personnel takeout and delivery options and type and quality of food and there are many wellestablished competitors we compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locallyowned restaurants we also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services particularly in the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées side dishes or meal preparation kits from the deli or prepared foods sections we compete primarily on the quality variety and value perception of menu items the number and location of restaurants type of brand quality and efficiency of service attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors we anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors if we are unable to continue to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are subject to changes in consumer preferences that may adversely affect demand for food at our restaurants 

consumers have continually changing health and dietary preferences as a result our diverse portfolio of restaurant brands are continually challenged to evolve our menu offerings to appeal to these changing customer preferences while maintaining our brand character and retaining popular menu items in response to the covid19 pandemic during periods of high public health risk many consumers chose to order food to go or for delivery rather than dining in at fullservice restaurants if covid19 cases increase or other future public health issues cause these preferences to increase we may need to further adapt our offerings to respond to these additional changes new information or changes in dietary nutritional allergen or health guidelines or environmental or sustainability concerns whether issued by government agencies academic studies advocacy organizations or similar groups may cause some groups of consumers to select foods other than those that are offered by our restaurants if we fail to anticipate changing trends or other consumer preferences our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business 

there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate each of which may harm our performance prospects or business the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction the dissemination of information online could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations regardless of the information’s accuracy 

  

many of our competitors are expanding their use of social media and new social media platforms are rapidly being developed potentially making more traditional social media platforms obsolete as a result we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies in order to maintain broad appeal with guests and brand relevance as part of our marketing efforts we rely on social media platforms and search engine marketing to attract and retain guests we also continue to invest in other digital marketing initiatives that allow us to reach our guests across multiple digital channels and build their awareness of engagement with and loyalty to our brands these initiatives may not be successful resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues increased employee engagement or brand recognition in addition a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media including the improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about us exposure of personally identifiable information fraud or outofdate information the inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation 

a failure to identify and execute innovative marketing and guest relationship tactics ineffective or improper use of other marketing initiatives and increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

if our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions if our advertising media or marketing expenses increase if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors or if we do not adequately leverage technology and data analytic capabilities needed to generate concise competitive insight we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations a failure to sufficiently innovate develop guest relationship initiatives or maintain adequate and effective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales 

as part of our marketing efforts we rely on social media platforms and search engine marketing to attract and retain guests these initiatives may not be successful and pose a variety of other risks as discussed above under the heading “our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business” 

a failure to address cost pressures including rising costs for commodities labor health care and utilities used by our restaurants and a failure to effectively deliver cost management activities and achieve economies of scale in purchasing could compress our margins and adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food ingredients labor health care utilities and other related costs over which we may have little control operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities including beef pork chicken seafood cheese butter and produce the introduction of or changes to tariffs on imported food products such as produce and seafood could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products we cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices menu offerings and menu prices and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results we attempt to leverage our size to achieve economies of scale in purchasing but there can be no assurances that we can always do so effectively we are also subject to the general risks of inflation 

increases in minimum wage health care and other benefit costs may have a material adverse effect on our labor costs we operate in many states and localities where the minimum wage is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage increases in minimum wage may also result in increases in the wage rates paid for nonminimum wage positions many states and localities are also passing laws regulating employment practices and working conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our labor costs in those areas 

our restaurants’ operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as electricity and natural gas whether as a result of inflation or otherwise on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply in addition interruptions to the availability of gas electric water or other utilities whether due to aging infrastructure weather conditions 

fire animal damage trees digging accidents or other reasons largely out of our control may adversely affect our operations our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and other general macroeconomic factors including unemployment energy prices and interest rates that are largely beyond our control may adversely affect consumer behavior and our results of operations 

our business results depend on a number of industryspecific and general economic factors many of which are beyond our control the fullservice dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in international national regional and local economic conditions seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant brands the performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends severe weather including hurricanes traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants 

general economic conditions including economic downturns related to the covid19 pandemic and uncertainty about the strength or pace of economic recovery have also adversely affected our results of operations and may continue to do so economic recession a protracted economic slowdown a worsening economy increased unemployment increased energy prices rising interest rates a downgrade of the us government’s longterm credit rating imposition of retaliatory tariffs on important us imports and exports or other industrywide cost pressures have affected and can continue to affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings job losses foreclosures bankruptcies and falling home prices have caused and may continue to cause guests to make fewer discretionary purchases and any significant decrease in our guest traffic or average profit per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance in addition if gasoline natural gas electricity and other energy costs increase and credit card home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency of their dining occasions may spend less on each dining occasion or may choose more inexpensive restaurants 

furthermore we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts terrorist attacks efforts to combat terrorism heightened security requirements or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems could have on our operations the economy or consumer confidence generally any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures 

unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our guests could increase our costs reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition and results of operations 

climate change adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could adversely affect our restaurant sales or results of operations 

climatologists predict that the longterm effects of climate change and global warming will result in more severe volatile weather or extended droughts which could increase the frequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations adverse weather conditions have in the past and may continue to impact guest traffic at our restaurants cause the temporary underutilization of outdoor patio seating and in more severe cases such as hurricanes tornadoes wildfires or other natural disasters cause temporary closures sometimes for prolonged periods which negatively impact our restaurant sales climate change and government regulation relating to climate change could result in construction delays and increased costs interruptions to the availability or increases in the cost of utilities and shortages or interruptions in the supply or increases to the costs of food items and other supplies 

risks relating to our business model and strategy 

a majority of our restaurants are operated in leased properties and as a result we are committed to longterm lease obligations that we may not be able to cancel if we want to close a restaurant location and we may be unable to renew the leases that we may want to extend at the end of their terms 

as of may 30 2021 1761 of our 1834 restaurants operating in the united states and canada operate in leased locations and the leases are generally noncancellable for some period of time if we close a restaurant in a leased location we may remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease which would include among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term additionally the potential losses associated with our inability to cancel leases may result in our keeping open restaurant locations that are performing significantly below targeted levels as a result ongoing lease obligations at closed or underperforming restaurant locations could impair our results of operations in addition at the end of the lease term and expiration of all renewal periods we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost if at all 

as a result we may be required to close or relocate a restaurant which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks and may have an adverse effect on our operating performance 

our inability or failure to execute on a comprehensive business continuity plan following a major natural disaster such as a hurricane or manmade disaster at our corporate facility could have a materially adverse impact on our business 

many of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one florida location   we have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature including hurricanes and other natural or manmade disasters and back up and offsite locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information however if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans we may experience delays in recovery of data inability to perform vital corporate functions tardiness in required reporting and compliance failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims 

we may lose sales or incur increased costs if our restaurants experience shortages delays or interruptions in the delivery of food and other products from our third party vendors and suppliers 

we have a limited number of suppliers and distributors for certain of our products and services shortages delays or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants may be caused by severe weather natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods droughts wildfires and earthquakes labor issues or other operational disruptions at our suppliers vendors or other service providers the inability of our vendors or service providers to manage adverse business conditions obtain credit or remain solvent or other conditions beyond our control such shortages delays or interruptions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our restaurant operations if we raise prices as a result of increased food costs or shortages it may negatively impact our sales if we temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular items from a restaurant’s menu that restaurant may experience a significant reduction in sales during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our guests changing their dining habits 

our failure to drive both shortterm and longterm profitable sales growth through brand relevance operating excellence opening new restaurants of existing brands and acquiring new restaurant brands could result in poor financial performance 

as part of our business strategy we intend to drive profitable sales growth by increasing samerestaurant sales at existing restaurants continuing to expand our current portfolio of restaurant brands and acquiring additional brands that can be expanded profitably this strategy involves numerous risks and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives 

at existing brands we may not be able to maintain brand relevance and restaurant operating excellence to achieve sustainable samerestaurant sales growth and warrant new unit growth existing brand shortterm sales growth could be impacted if we are unable to drive near term guest count and sales growth and longterm sales growth could be impacted if we fail to extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to our guests a failure to innovate and extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to guests and occasions in order to generate sustainable samerestaurant traffic growth and produce nontraditional sales and earnings growth opportunities insufficient focus on our competition or failure to adequately address declines in the casual dining industry could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition we may not be able to support sustained new unit growth or open all of our planned new restaurants and the new restaurants that we open may not be profitable or as profitable as our existing restaurants new restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize and even sales at successful newlyopened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation the opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on guest counts and sales levels at existing restaurants 

the ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations the need to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses on a timely basis the need to comply with other regulatory requirements the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay construction increases in labor and building material costs supply chain disruptions the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms changes in patterns or severity of weather or other acts of god that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions at each potential location we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites construction contractors management personnel hourly employees and other 

resources if we are unable to successfully manage these risks we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated sales and earnings in future periods 

we also may not be able to identify and successfully acquire and integrate additional brands that are as profitable as our existing restaurants or that provide potential for further growth 

a lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

the success of our restaurants depends in large part on their locations as demographic and economic patterns change current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations in addition desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation the occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may experience higherthananticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants we incur substantial preopening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close relocate or remodel existing restaurants the expenses of opening closing relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated an increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees and licensees 

certain of our domestic and all of our international locations other than in canada are operated by franchisees or licensees we believe that we have selected highcaliber operating partners and franchisees with significant experience in restaurant operations and are providing them with training and support however the probability of opening ultimate success and quality of any franchise or licensed restaurant rests principally with the franchisee or licensee if the franchisee or licensee does not successfully open and operate its restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards or guests have negative experiences due to issues with food quality or operational execution our brand values could suffer which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we face a variety of risks associated with doing business with business partners and vendors in foreign markets 

we are making efforts to expand our brands overseas through licensing and franchising relationships there is no assurance that international operations will be profitable or that international growth will continue our international operations are subject to all of the same risks associated with our domestic operations as well as a number of additional risks these include among other things international economic and political conditions foreign currency fluctuations and differing cultures and consumer preferences in addition expansion into international markets could create risks to our brands and reputation 

we also are subject to governmental regulations throughout the world that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors these include antitrust and tax requirements antiboycott regulations importexportcustoms regulations and other international trade regulations the usa patriot act the foreign corrupt practices act and applicable local law failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we may use to hedge exposures to fluctuations in commodity and broader market prices may cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we use or may use derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our principal ingredient labor and energy costs including but not limited to coffee butter wheat soybean oil pork beef diesel fuel gasoline and natural gas changes in the values of these derivatives may be recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings included in our consolidated financial statements 

volatility in the united states equity markets affects our ability to efficiently hedge exposures to our market risk related to equitybased compensation awards 

the equity markets in the us were extremely volatile due to the covid19 pandemic and due to the unpredictability of the recovery of the united states economy as a result of the pandemic and due to government and other responses thereto market volatility has contributed to and may continue to contribute to fluctuations in the company’s stock price we have equity hedges in place to protect the company from exposure to market risk related to future payout of equitybased compensation awards however because these hedges also net settle on a cash basis quarterly we have been and may in the future be required to make cash payments at those quarterly settlement dates and the amounts of those payments are difficult to during periods of extreme volatility in the equity markets these cash payments may ultimately be offset by payments to us from the hedge counterparties or reductions in expected payouts to employees when those equity hedges finally fully settle and the related equity awards pay out 

failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business 

we regard our olive garden ®  longhorn steakhouse ®  cheddar’s scratch kitchen ®  yard house ®  the capital grille ®  the capital burger ®  seasons 52 ®  bahama breeze ®  eddie v’s prime seafood ®  darden ® and darden restaurants ® service marks and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts copyrights patents trademarks service marks and other common law rights such as trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our restaurants and services from infringement we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the united states and foreign jurisdictions however we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other persons although our policy is to oppose any such infringement further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources 

general risks 

litigation including allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees guests suppliers business partners shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation these actions and proceedings may involve allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices including wage and hour violations and employment discrimination guest discrimination food safety issues including poor food quality foodborne illness food tampering food contamination and adverse health effects from consumption of various food products or highcalorie foods including obesity other personal injury including claims related to covid19 violation of “dram shop” laws providing an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or a third party trademark infringement violation of the federal securities laws or other concerns the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time the cost to defend litigation may be significant there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease guest acceptance of our brands regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are found liable litigation could impact our operations in other ways as well allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices for example could adversely affect employee acquisition and retention as a result litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable publicity or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could harm our reputation and adversely impact our guest counts and sales 

the good reputation of our restaurant brands is a key factor in the success of our business actual or alleged incidents at any of our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could harm our brands even incidents occurring at restaurants operated by our competitors or in the supply chain generally could result in negative publicity that could harm the restaurant industry overall and indirectly our own brands negative publicity may result from allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices employee dissatisfaction guest discrimination illness injury or any of the other matters discussed above that could give rise to litigation regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants or to only a single restaurant could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand negative publicity also may result from health concerns including food safety and flu or virus outbreaks publication of government or industry findings concerning food products environmental disasters crime incidents data security breaches scandals involving our employees or operational problems at our restaurants all of which could make our brands and menu 

offerings less appealing to our guests and negatively impact our guest counts and sales adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of our brands or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business 

disruptions in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact consumer spending patterns and affect the availability and cost of credit 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control turmoil in global credit markets could adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future there can be no assurances that we will be able to arrange credit on terms we believe are acceptable or that permit us to finance our business with historical margins a lack of credit could have an adverse impact on certain of our suppliers landlords and other tenants in retail centers in which we are located if these issues occur they could negatively affect our financial results any new disruptions in the financial markets may also adversely affect the us and world economy which could negatively impact consumer spending patterns 

impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment of goodwill exists factors may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and slower growth rates any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations we compute the amount of impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of that reporting unit we are required to record a noncash impairment charge if the testing performed indicates that goodwill has been impaired 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets primarily the longhorn steakhouse ®  cheddar’s scratch kitchen ®  the capital grille ®  yard house ® and eddie v’s prime seafood ® trademarks to determine if they are definite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

as with goodwill we test our indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairments of these or other assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results 

we are primarily subject to income and other taxes in the united states our effective income tax rate and other taxes in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws or other legislative changes and the outcome of income tax audits although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of a tax audit could have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made in addition our effective income tax rate and our results may be impacted by our ability to realize deferred tax benefits and by any increases or decreases of our valuation allowances applied to our existing deferred tax assets 

failure of our internal controls over financial reporting and future changes in accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results affect our reported results of operations or otherwise harm our business and financial results 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect 

a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud our growth and acquisition of other restaurant companies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud a significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation 

a change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future changes to existing accounting rules or the application of current accounting practices may adversely affect our reported financial results additionally our assumptions estimates and judgments related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including but not limited to revenue recognition fair value of investments impairment of longlived assets leases and related economic transactions derivatives pension and postretirement benefits intangibles selfinsurance income taxes property and equipment unclaimed property laws and litigation and stockbased compensation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by us changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance

covid19 pandemic 

for much of fiscal 2021 the covid19 pandemic resulted in a significant reduction in guest traffic at our restaurants due to changes in consumer behavior as public health officials encouraged social distancing and required personal protective equipment and state and local governments mandated restrictions including suspension of dinein operations reduced restaurant seating capacity table spacing requirements bar closures and additional physical barriers beginning in late march 2020 we operated with all of our dining rooms closed and served our guests in a to go only or to go and delivery format in late april 2020 state and local governments began to allow us to open dining rooms at limited capacities along with other operating restrictions 

as a result we began fiscal 2021 with significant limitations on our operations which over the course of the fiscal year varied widely from time to time state to state and city to city during november 2020 rising case rates resulted in certain jurisdictions implementing restrictions that again reduced dining room capacity or mandated the reclosure of dining rooms once covid19 vaccines were approved and moved into wider distribution in the united states in early 2021 public health conditions improved and almost all of the covid19 restrictions on businesses have eased as of the date of this report all of our restaurants were able to open their dining rooms to some extent and few capacity restrictions or other covid19 restrictions remained in place in the united states however it is possible additional outbreaks could require us to again reduce our capacity or limit or suspend our inrestaurant dining operations 

as we navigated through the pandemic we took significant steps to adapt our business model to allow us to continue to serve guests and support our team members including investing in our team members through enhanced pay and benefits streamlining our restaurant processes simplifying our menus and accelerating the rollout of technology to all of our brands to enhance the offpremise and inrestaurant guest experience as our dining rooms have returned to full or closetofull capacity we are focused on continuing to provide a safe environment for our team members and guests and maintaining many of the operating efficiencies established during fiscal 2021 

fiscal 2021 financial highlights 

our sales from continuing operations were 720 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to 781 billion in fiscal 2020 the 78 percent decrease in sales from continuing operations was primarily driven by negative combined darden samerestaurant sales of 78 percent and one less week of operations in fiscal 2021 partially offset by revenue from the addition of 30 net new companyowned restaurants the decrease in samerestaurant sales was driven by the impact of covid19 

net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2021 was 6324 million 480 per diluted share compared with a net loss from continuing operations for fiscal 2020 of 492 million 040 per diluted share our results from continuing operations for fiscal 2021 increased compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to the economic impacts of covid19 which had a material adverse effect specifically on the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 including 3900 million of impairments 

our net loss from discontinued operations was 31 million 003 per diluted share for fiscal 2021 compared with a net loss from discontinued operations of 32 million 003 per diluted share for fiscal 2020 when combined with results from 

continuing operations our diluted net earnings per share was 477 for fiscal 2021 and diluted net loss per share was 043 for fiscal 2020 

outlook 

we expect fiscal 2022 sales from continuing operations to increase between 28 percent and 32 percent driven by darden samerestaurant sales growth of 25 percent to 29 percent and approximately 3540 new restaurants in fiscal 2022 we expect our annual effective tax rate to be between 130 percent and 140 percent and we expect capital expenditures incurred to build new restaurants remodel and maintain existing restaurants and technology initiatives to be between 3750 million and 4250 million

fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020

income taxes 

during fiscal 2021 we had an income tax benefit of 559 million 97 percent effective tax rate compared to an income tax benefit of 1118 million 694 percent effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 the significant change was driven primarily by the fact that we had 5765 million in earnings before taxes in fiscal 2021 compared to a net loss before taxes 1610 million in fiscal 2020 for fiscal 2021 our effective tax rate was also impacted by the generation of a net operating loss for tax purposes that will be carried back to the previous five tax years we generated a net operating loss for tax purposes due to several factors including the impact of covid19 accelerated tax depreciation increased tax deductions for equity vestings and exercises tax accounting method changes and various other tax planning initiatives an income tax benefit is generated due to the difference in federal tax rates between fiscal year 2021 and the years to which the federal net operating loss will be carried back 

net earnings and net earnings per share from continuing operations 

net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2021 were 6324 million 480 per diluted share compared with net loss from continuing operations for fiscal 2020 of 492 million 040 per diluted share

segment results 

we manage our restaurant brands olive garden longhorn steakhouse cheddar’s scratch kitchen yard house the capital grille seasons 52 bahama breeze and eddie v’s in the us and canada as operating segments we aggregate our operating segments into reportable segments based on a combination of the size economic characteristics and subsegment of fullservice dining within which each brand operates our four reportable segments are 1 olive garden 2 longhorn steakhouse 3 fine dining and 4 other business see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report for further details 

our management uses segment profit as the measure for assessing performance of our segments the following table presents segment profit margin for the periods indicated 



the increase in the olive garden segment profit margin for fiscal 2021 was driven primarily by lower restaurant labor as well as lower marketing expenses the increase in the longhorn steakhouse segment profit margin for fiscal 2021 was driven by leveraging positive samerestaurant sales as well as lower marketing expenses the increase in in the fine dining segment profit margin for 2021 was driven by lower marketing expenses and lower food and beverage costs the increase in the other business segment profit margin for 2021 was driven by lower restaurant labor and lower marketing expenses 

results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to 2019 

for a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended may 31 2020 and may 26 2019 see “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended may 31 2020 filed with the sec on july 24 2020 

seasonality 

our sales volumes have historically fluctuated seasonally typically our average sales per restaurant are highest in the winter and spring followed by the summer and lowest in the fall however throughout fiscal 2021 a variety of factors including the impacts of covid19 on our business government actions taken to respond to covid19 and to stimulate the united states’ recovery from covid19 and changing consumer preferences caused fluctuations in our sales volumes that were different than our typical seasonality additionally holidays changes in the economy severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions because of the historical seasonality of our business and these other factors results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

impact of inflation 

we attempt to minimize the annual effects of inflation through appropriate planning operating practices and menu price increases we do not believe inflation had a significant overall effect on our annual results of operations during fiscal 2021 or 2020 

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions we consider the following estimates to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

leases 

we evaluate our leases at their inception to estimate their expected term which commences on the date when we have the right to control the use of the leased property and includes the noncancelable base term plus all option periods we are reasonably certain to exercise our judgment in determining the appropriate expected term and discount rate for each lease affects our evaluation of 

• the classification and accounting for leases as operating versus finance 

• the rent holidays and escalation in payments that are included in the calculation of the lease liability and related rightofuse asset and 

• the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant facility are amortized 

these judgments may produce materially different amounts of lease liabilities and rightofuse assets recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as well as depreciation amortization interest and rent expense recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings if different discount rates and expected lease terms were used 

valuation of longlived assets 

land buildings and equipment operating lease rightofuse assets and certain other assets including definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows changes in expected useful life unanticipated competition slower growth rates ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets or changes in the usage or operating performance any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements based on a review of operating results for each of our restaurants the amount of net book value associated with lower performing restaurants that would be deemed at risk for impairment is not material to our consolidated financial statements 

valuation and recoverability of goodwill and trademarks 

we have eight reporting units six of which had goodwill and seven of which had trademarks goodwill and trademarks are not subject to amortization and goodwill has been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing the reporting units are our restaurant brands a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and slower growth rates any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements we review our goodwill and trademarks for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 

during fiscal 2021 we elected to perform a qualitative assessment for our annual impairment review of goodwill and trademarks to determine whether or not indicators of impairment exist in considering the qualitative approach related to goodwill we evaluated factors including but not limited to covid19 macroeconomic conditions market and industry conditions commodity cost fluctuations competitive environment share price performance results of prior impairment tests operational stability the overall financial performance of the reporting units and the impacts of discount rates as it relates to trademarks we evaluate similar factors from the goodwill assessment in addition to impacts of royalty rates based on the results of the qualitative assessment which considered the improvements of each of our brands’ financial performance as well as the improved overall operating environment no indicators of impairment were identified changes in circumstances existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future or in the numerous estimates associated with management’s judgments and assumptions made in assessing the fair value of our goodwill and trademarks could result in an impairment loss of a portion or all of our goodwill or trademarks 

impairment of our assets including goodwill or trademarks adversely affects our financial position and results of operations and our leverage ratio for purposes of our revolving credit agreement revolving credit agreement increases a leverage ratio exceeding the maximum permitted under our revolving credit agreement would be a default under our revolving credit agreement at may 30 2021 additional writedowns of goodwill other indefinitelived intangible assets or any other assets in excess of approximately 169 billion would have been required to cause our leverage ratio to exceed the permitted maximum as our leverage ratio is determined on a quarterly basis and due to the seasonal nature of our business a lesser amount of impairment in future quarters could cause our leverage ratio to exceed the permitted maximum 

unearned revenues 

unearned revenues primarily represent our liability for gift cards that have been sold but not yet redeemed the estimated value of gift cards expected to remain unused is recognized over the expected period of redemption as the remaining gift card values are redeemed generally over a period of 12 years utilizing this method we estimate both the amount of breakage and the time period of redemption if actual redemption patterns vary from our estimates actual gift card breakage income may differ from the amounts recorded we update our estimates of our redemption period and our breakage rate periodically and apply that rate to gift card redemptions on a prospective basis changing our breakagerate estimates by 50 basis points would have resulted in an adjustment in our breakage income of approximately 24 million for fiscal 2021 

income taxes 

we estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes these estimates include among other items depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported employee tip income effective rates for state and local income taxes and the tax deductibility of certain other items we adjust our annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available 

assessment of uncertain tax positions requires judgments relating to the amounts timing and likelihood of resolution as described in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report the 518 million balance of unrecognized tax benefits at may 30 2021 includes 359 million related to tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts could change during the next 12 months based on the outcome of examinations of the 359 million 180 million relates to items that would impact our effective income tax rate 

liquidity and capital resources 

typically cash flows generated from operating activities are our principal source of liquidity which we use to finance capital expenditures for new restaurants and to remodel and maintain existing restaurants to pay dividends to our shareholders and to repurchase shares of our common stock since substantially all of our sales are for cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable are generally paid in 5 to 90 days we are typically able to carry current liabilities in excess of current assets as previously noted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 all of our restaurants began operating at reduced capacities due to covid19 and initially were not able to generate sufficient cash from operations to cover all of our projected expenditures while 

operating at those reduced capacities accordingly we took significant steps to adapt our business which allowed us to continue to serve guests support our team members and secure our liquidity position to provide financial flexibility as state and local governments allowed us to open dining rooms at limited capacities our cash flows improved and during fiscal 2021 we generated positive operating cash flows and fully repaid our 2700 million 364day term loan prior to maturity additionally our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 110 per share to be paid on august 2 2021 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on july 9 2021 

we currently manage our business and financial ratios to target an investmentgrade bond rating which has historically allowed flexible access to financing at reasonable costs our publicly issued longterm debt currently carries the following ratings 

• moody’s investors service “baa3” 

• standard  poor’s “bbb” and 

• fitch “bbb” 

our commercial paper has ratings of 

• moody’s investors service “p3” 

• standard  poor’s “a3” and 

• fitch “f3” 

these ratings are as of the date of the filing of this report and have been obtained with the understanding that moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch will continue to monitor our credit and make future adjustments to these ratings to the extent warranted the ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our securities may be changed superseded or withdrawn at any time and should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

we maintain a 7500 million revolving credit agreement with bank of america na boa as administrative agent and the lenders and other agents party thereto the revolving credit agreement is a senior unsecured credit commitment to the company and contains customary representations and affirmative and negative covenants including limitations on liens and subsidiary debt and a maximum consolidated lease adjusted total debt to total capitalization ratio of 075 to 100 and events of default usual for credit facilities of this type as of may 30 2021 we were in compliance with all covenants under the revolving credit agreement 

the revolving credit agreement matures on october 27 2022 and the proceeds may be used for working capital and capital expenditures the refinancing of certain indebtedness certain acquisitions and general corporate purposes loans under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at a rate of libor plus a margin determined by reference to a ratingsbased pricing grid applicable margin or the base rate which is defined as the highest of the boa prime rate plus 0075 percent the federal funds rate plus 0500 percent and the eurocurrency rate plus 1075 percent plus the applicable margin assuming a “bbb” equivalent credit rating level the applicable margin under the revolving credit agreement will be 1075 percent for libor loans and 0075 percent for base rate loans as of may 30 2021 we had no outstanding balances under the revolving credit agreement 

at may 30 2021 our longterm debt consisted principally of 

• 5000 million of unsecured 3850 percent senior notes due in may 2027 

• 963 million of unsecured 6000 percent senior notes due in august 2035 

• 428 million of unsecured 6800 percent senior notes due in october 2037 and 

• 3000 million of unsecured 4550 percent senior notes due in february 2048 

the interest rate on our 428 million 6800 percent senior notes due october 2037 is subject to adjustment from time to time if the debt rating assigned to such series of notes is downgraded below a certain rating level or subsequently upgraded the maximum adjustment is 2000 percent above the initial interest rate and the interest rate cannot be reduced below the initial interest rate as of may 30 2021 no such adjustments are made to this rate 

through our shelf registration statement on file with the sec depending on conditions prevailing in the public capital markets we may issue equity securities or unsecured debt securities from time to time in one or more series which may consist of notes debentures or other evidences of indebtedness in one or more offerings 

from time to time we may repurchase our outstanding debt in privately negotiated transactions such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements and other factors 

from time to time we enter into interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk inherent in our operations see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report 

a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at may 30 2021 is as follows

strategy 

we believe that capable operators of strong multiunit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the restaurant industry’s fullservice segment generally the restaurant industry is considered to be comprised of three segments quick service fast casual and fullservice all of our restaurants fall within the fullservice segment which is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains we believe we have strong brands and that the breadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the fullservice restaurant industry this collective capability is the product of investments over many years in areas that are critical to success in our business including restaurant operations excellence brand management excellence supply chain talent management and information technology among other things 

although the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 required us to focus on adapting our business to account for the impacts of the covid19 pandemic our operating philosophy remains focused on strengthening the core operational fundamentals of the business by providing an outstanding guest experience rooted in culinary innovation attentive service engaging atmosphere and integrated marketing darden enables each brand to reach its full potential by leveraging its scale insights and experience in a way that protects uniqueness and competitive advantages additionally our brands can capitalize on data insights to deliver customized onetoone customer relationship marketing we hold ourselves accountable for operating our restaurants with a sense of urgency to achieve our commitments to all of our stakeholders 

recent and planned restaurant growth 

during fiscal 2020  we added 19 net new companyowned restaurants in the united states our fiscal 2020 actual restaurant openings and closings fiscal 2021 projected openings and approximate capital investment square footage and dining capacity by brand are shown below 



 

while our objective is to continue to expand all of our restaurant brands the actual number of openings for each of our brands for fiscal 2021 will depend on many factors including local operating restrictions related to covid19 our ability to locate appropriate sites negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms obtain necessary local governmental permits complete construction and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel 

we consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant’s longterm success and we devote significant effort to the site selection process prior to entering a market we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors these factors include trade area demographics such as target population density and household income levels competitive influences in the trade area the site’s visibility accessibility and traffic volume and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls hotelmotel complexes offices and universities members of senior management evaluate inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after the site is acquired and permits are obtained 

we systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards when a restaurant falls below minimum standards we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes and implement operational and marketing plans to improve that restaurant’s performance if performance does not improve to acceptable levels the restaurant is evaluated for relocation closing or conversion to one of our other brands permanent closures are typically due to economic changes in trade areas the expiration of lease agreements or site concerns accordingly we continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges 

restaurant operations 

we believe that highquality restaurant management is critical to our longterm success our restaurant management structure varies by brand and restaurant size we issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards 

the management structures below describe our restaurant operations during the normal and fully operational conditions that were in place for the first three quarters of fiscal 2020  as the covid19 pandemic began affecting our business the staffing requirements of e ach restaurant varied widely as all dining rooms closed for portions of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and then changed further as dining rooms began reopening with various opening configurations towards the end of the quarter as our restaurant operations continue to evolve in response to the pandemic we are evaluating our operational structure and making adjustments where appropriate as a result the descriptions below may not reflect the current or future structure of our restaurant operations 

each olive garden restaurant is led by a general manager and each longhorn steakhouse and cheddar’s scratch kitchen restaurant is led by a managing partner each also has three to six additional managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant in addition each restaurant typically employs between 60 to 175 hourly team members most of whom work parttime restaurant general managers or managing partners report to a director of operations who is responsible for approximately five to ten restaurants each director of operations reports to a senior vice president of operations who is responsible for between 80 and 100 restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by operations management including officer level executives to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards and to solicit feedback on opportunities for improvement

our learning and employee development team in partnership with each brand’s training leader together with senior operations executives is responsible for developing and maintaining our operations training programs these efforts include a 10 to 12week training program for management trainees and continuing development programs for all levels of leadership the emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant brand but includes leadership restaurant business management and culinary skills we also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants including deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations the opening training teams typically begin work one and a half weeks prior to opening and remain at the new restaurant for up to three weeks after the opening they are redeployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant’s operating staff 

we maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our managementlevel team members we believe that our leadership position strong resultsoriented culture and various shortterm and longterm incentive programs including stockbased compensation enhances our ability to attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers 

quality assurance 

our total quality department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe highquality food in a clean and safe environment 

food safety and our total quality program 

through rigorous supplier and riskbased product evaluations we purchase only products that meet or exceed our product specifications we rely on independent third parties to inspect and evaluate our suppliers and distributors suppliers that produce “highrisk” products are subject to a food safety evaluation by darden personnel at least annually we require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive hazard analysis and critical control point haccp food safety programs and riskbased preventative controls adopted by the us food and drug administration these programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause foodborne illnesses by applying scientificallybased controls to analyze hazards identify and monitor critical control points and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met we require routine food safety verification for highrisk products from our suppliers our total quality 

managers and third party auditors visit each restaurant regularly throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation the total quality managers also serve as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety 

restaurant guest and team member safety in response to covid19 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we have enhanced restaurant safety practices and made other enhancements to our operations to comply with state and local government regulations and health recommendations to ensure team member wellness maintain clean restaurants practice social distancing and wear protective equipment some of our covid19 enhanced procedures include 

• all team members are being screened to ensure they are symptomfree before returning to work and we are conducting daily health and temperature checks at every restaurant before team members are allowed to begin their shift we provide paid sick leave for our restaurant team members so that they can stay home if they do not feel well 

• prior to welcoming guests back into our dining rooms following our temporary dining room closures we thoroughly cleaned and sanitized each of our restaurant buildings using proven procedures and processes known to protect against contagious viruses like covid19 in addition to our already strict restaurant cleaning procedures which exceed centers for disease control and prevention cdc guidelines we have continued to regularly disinfect all guest and team member touchpoints using our cdcapproved disinfectant these include but are not limited to disinfecting guest tables after each use as well as regularly disinfecting table top tablets check presenters menus pens restrooms door handles and other common surfaces 

• we have and continue to reconfigure our dining rooms to create more space between tables we are also taking steps to ensure there is no congregating in our lobby and bar areas where regulations require 

• in accordance with the cdc’s guidance regarding face coverings and many state and local orders we require all team members to wear masks our culinary team members wear gloves and all team members will continue to practice frequent and effective handwashing 

• third party auditors also ensure that restaurant team members are adhering to covid19 preventive guidelines 

purchasing and distribution 

our ability to ensure a consistent supply of safe highquality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant brands depends on reliable sources of procurement our purchasing staff sources negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 1500 suppliers whose products originate in more than 35 countries suppliers must meet our requirements and strict quality control standards in the development harvest catch and production of food products competitive bids longterm contracts and strategic supplier relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we have taken the following steps to enhance the safety and reliability of our supply chain 

• safety  the company’s cross functional covid19 task force implemented cdcbased guidelines for restaurants described in quality assurance  above we also implemented and communicated guidelines for our distributors and other suppliers providing services inside our restaurants including required use of personal protective equipment ppe to support these enhanced safety protocols we secured a supply of the necessary volumes of ppe and cleaning products for our restaurants and team members 

• sourcing as we transitioned to increased to go business during the temporary closure of our dining rooms we secured supplies of new and additional packaging products to better support food and beverage transport we also sourced alternate formats of alcohol beverages for to go in order to comply with state laws that permitted to go sales of alcohol to mitigate the potential risk of geographic trade disruptions we created contingency plans in anticipation of supply chain obstacles the purchasing team also mitigated obsoleteexpiring inventory exposure by selling products to retail outlets 

• distribution  we increased inventory levels for brandcritical items restaurant cleaning products and ppe supplies to ensure sufficient supply of necessary products an internal crossfunctional team was created specifically to ensure successful restaurant rampdown and quick reopening support 

we believe that our significant scale is a competitive advantage and our purchasing team leverages this purchasing capability our purchasing staff travels routinely within the united states and internationally to source topquality food products 

at competitive prices during the covid19 pandemic we are monitoring our suppliers remotely hosting virtual visits with potential new suppliers and conducting virtual request for proposal processes we believe that we have established excellent longterm relationships with key suppliers and usually source our product directly from producers not brokers or middlemen we actively support several national minority supplier organizations to ensure that we incorporate women and minorityowned businesses in our purchasing decisions 

we have entered into longterm agreements with multiple thirdparty national distribution companies to deliver food and supplies to our restaurants under these arrangements we maintain ownership of the food and supplies inventory through our subsidiary darden direct distribution inc darden direct this inventory is stored in distribution company warehouses that are wholly or primarily dedicated to darden where practical to do so because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales 

we continue to drive automation of our supply chain by collaborating with our suppliers logistics partners and distributors to improve optimization with information visibility and other technological advances these and other terms of darden direct’s longterm supply agreements further enable our purchasing staff to integrate demand forecasts into our purchasing operations driving efficiencies in our operations 

advertising and marketing 

integrated marketing is a key element of our strategy and our scale enables us to be a leading advertiser in the fullservice dining segment of the restaurant industry olive garden leverages the efficiency of national network television advertising supplemented with cable local television and digital advertising longhorn steakhouse uses local television and digital advertising to build engagement and loyalty by market cheddar’s scratch kitchen yard house the capital grille seasons 52 bahama breeze and eddie v’s do not use television advertising but rely on local and digital marketing in response to the covid19 pandemic we significantly reduced our television advertising spending and directed our marketing efforts towards growing and promoting our to go options and offpremise dining business our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to build awareness and strengthen our brands’ relevance we implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase our sales and profits as well as increase frequency of visitation by our guests we also rely on outdoor billboard direct mail and email advertising as well as radio newspapers digital coupons search engine marketing and social media such as facebook® and instagram® as appropriate to attract engage and retain our guests we have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor guest satisfaction and evolving food service trends and marketplace dynamics 

in fiscal 2020  we continued a multiyear effort to implement new technology platforms that allow us to digitally engage with our guests and team members and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities in an increasingly connected society we also continued making improvements to our online and mobile ordering system for olive garden and longhorn steakhouse and accelerated rollout of online and mobile ordering and payment systems across all of our other brands in addition we continued working on developing sophisticated customer relationship management programs data analytics and datadriven marketing approaches to effectively and efficiently target our existing and potential guests across our portfolio of brands this enables us to tailor our messaging and offerings depending on guest visit history preferences and brand loyalty 

employees 

at the end of fiscal 2020  we employed approximately 177000 people team members in the united states and canada in response to the covid19 pandemic and the temporary closure of all of our dining rooms discussed above we placed many restaurant and corporate team members on furlough for portions of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020  at the highest point during that quarter approximately 150000 team members were on furlough but that number had reduced to 95000 as of the end of fiscal 2020  as local and state governments began permitting the reopening of dining rooms throughout the month of may 2020 of the 177000 total team members approximately 167000 were hourly restaurant personnel the remainder were restaurant management personnel located in the restaurants or in the field or were located at our restaurant support center facility in orlando florida 

our executives have an average of 16 years of experience with darden the restaurant general managers and managing partners average 13 years with us we believe that we provide working conditions and pay and benefits that compare favorably with those of our competitors most team members other than restaurant management and corporate management are paid on an hourly basis none of our team members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our employee relations to be good 

as a fullservice restaurant company food is always top of mind but our team members make the difference they are at the heart of everything we do we believe the guest experience can never exceed the team member experience so we hire the best and retain them by fostering an environment of respect where diversity of thought and background is valued and everyone has the 

opportunity to develop and grow their careers we offer our team members flexible work schedules and competitive pay and benefits including paid sick leave which we introduced in march 2020 

consistent with one of our core values of diversity we are committed to attracting retaining engaging and developing a workforce that mirrors the diversity of our guests approximately 51 percent of our hourly restaurant team members are minorities and 56 percent are female additionally we employ members of five generations of the united states population traditionalists baby boomers generation x millennials and centennials 

consistent with our core values of respect and caring and teamwork in fiscal 1999 we established a program called darden dimes to help fellow darden team members in need   darden dimes provides shortterm financial grants to team members experiencing financial need caused by unexpected emergencies or catastrophic natural disasters participating team members donate as little as 10 cents from each paycheck to the darden dimes fund which raises and grants more than 15 million annually 

we succeed because of our people and with our success come rewards recognition and great opportunities for our team members we invest in their careers every step of the way by providing the tools they need to succeed in their current roles to grow personally and professionally and to deliver exceptional experiences to our guests each day with thousands of leadership positions across our restaurants we provide a pathway and training for thousands of individuals across the country to advance from entrylevel jobs into management roles in addition our geographic footprint often puts us in a position to offer our restaurant team members jobs in their current roles when personal circumstances require relocation this is one of the reasons darden has enjoyed the lowest annual turnover rates for hourly team members in the industry while we are experiencing unprecedented circumstances during the covid19 pandemic our people first philosophy stands firm and we will continue to find and offer growth opportunities to team members aspiring for more in their careers 

information technology and cybersecurity 

we strive for leadership in the restaurant business by using technology as a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy we have implemented technologyenabled business solutions to improve financial control cost management guest service and employee effectiveness as well as enable ecommerce these solutions are designed to be used across restaurant brands yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant brand our strategy is to fully integrate systems to drive operational efficiencies and enable restaurant teams to focus on restaurant operations excellence restaurant hardware and software support for all of our restaurant brands is provided or coordinated from the restaurant support center facility in orlando florida our data network sends and receives business data to and from the restaurants throughout the day and night providing timely and extensive information on business activity in every location our data center contains sufficient computing power to process information from all restaurants quickly and efficiently our information is processed in a secure environment to protect both our data and the physical computing assets we guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan which includes storing critical business information offsite testing the disaster recovery plan at a hostsite facility and providing onsite power backup we also conduct a thirdparty security review of our network and systems on a regular basis we use internally developed proprietary software cloudbased software as a service saas as well as purchased software with proven nonproprietary hardware 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we accelerated implementation of online ordering and payment for brands that did not previously provide this option including cheddar’s scratch kitchen seasons 52 the capital grille and eddie v’s all darden brands now share a secure robust digital platform with online ordering and other guestfacing capabilities we will continue to leverage our digital platform to address changing guest needs additionally we made changes to our restaurant systems that were necessary to efficiently support increasing demand for to go and curbside pickup orders and to facilitate social distancing requirements once dining rooms started to reopen 

we maintain a robust system of data protection and cybersecurity resources technology and processes we remain constantly vigilant of new and emerging risks and everchanging legal and compliance requirements and make strategic continued investments in those systems to keep company guest and team member data secure we monitor risks of sensitive information compromise at our business partners where relevant and reevaluate those relationships if necessary we provide annual security awareness training to our management and restaurant support center team members we also provide annual credit card handling training following payment card industry pci guidelines to all team members that handle guest credit cards 

our management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates positions us well to support current needs and future growth we use a strategic information systems planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning we provide data protection and cybersecurity reports to the audit committee of the company’s board of directors on a quarterly basis and periodically to the full board of directors information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic financial regulatory and other business advantage criteria 

competition 

the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food price service restaurant location personnel brand attractiveness of facilities availability of carryout and home delivery internet and mobile ordering capabilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing the restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing restaurants and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power we compete within each market with national and regional chains and locallyowned restaurants for guests management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites we also face growing competition from the supermarket industry which offers convenient meals in the form of improved entrées side dishes or meal preparation kits from the deli or prepared foods sections in addition improving product offerings at fast casual restaurants and quickservice restaurants and expansion of home delivery services together with negative economic conditions could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives we expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas 

other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled “purchasing and distribution” “advertising and marketing” and “information technology and cybersecurity” in this item 1 and in our risk factors in item 1a of this form 10k

seasonality 

our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally typically our average sales per restaurant are highest in the winter and spring followed by the summer and lowest in the fall holidays changes in the economy severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions because of the seasonality of our business results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year we are not able to predict the impact that the covid19 pandemic may have on the seasonality of our business 

government regulation 

we are subject to various federal state local and international laws affecting our business each of our restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities which include health safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located the development and operation of restaurants depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites which are subject to zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations to date we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals 

the covid19 pandemic has caused a panoply of federal state and local government regulations affecting our business to be issued and frequently revised on a daily andor weekly basis beginning in march 2020 and continuing through the date of this report regulations relating to paid sick leave opening and closing of bars restaurants and dining rooms business hours sanitation practices to go alcohol sales guest spacing within dining rooms and other social distancing practices and ppe usage by both team members and guests have materially affected the way we operate our business and serve our guests 

during fiscal 2020  114 percent of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site in most cases on an annual basis and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time these regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant operation including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours of operation advertising wholesale purchasing inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020  many states modified their regulations to permit to go sales of alcoholic beverages and during the temporary closure of our restaurants we offered a variety of alcoholic beverages including in bottles from draft and mixed drinks to go the failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these alcoholic beverage licenses or to comply with regulations governing the sale of alcoholic beverages would adversely affect the restaurant’s operations we also are subject in certain states to “dram shop” statutes which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person who then causes injury to himself or a third party we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance

we are subject to federal and state environmental regulations but these rules have not had a material effect on our operations during fiscal 2020  there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated 

our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 ada and related state accessibility statutes under the ada and related state laws we must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment and when constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of our restaurants we must make those facilities accessible

sustainability 

the sustainability of our food sources and restaurant operations is a key component of providing great service and food to our guests the covid19 pandemic necessitated that we focus on business critical items in the shortterm but we continue to believe that sustainability contributes to our overall business success over the longterm we will continue to adapt our approach in the current economic environment with intent to return to our integrated and strategic priorities in the near term across the enterprise from the food we source to the operation of our restaurants 

we are proud to operate some of the most efficient restaurants in the united states darden manages energy and water conservation within our restaurant operations over the last decade we have realized a 15 reduction in energy use per restaurant and a 20 reduction in water usage on average per restaurant and we continue to realize cost savings from historical reductions in our daily operating costs darden continues to reduce landfill waste by minimizing food loss and optimizing food donation programs across all of our restaurants in fiscal 2019 we conducted an indepth waste characterization at olive garden and longhorn steakhouse to continue to optimize waste diversion programs as our portfolio has grown over time we have done so sustainably since 2008 we have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions per restaurant by 18 percent as measured in accordance with the corporate accounting and reporting standard of the greenhouse gas protocol 



 we shared darden’s food principles in 2016 to outline our commitment to guests in areas of sustainable sourcing nutritional disclosure food safety and animal welfare darden’s food principles connect each of these strategic business efforts in a guestcentered platform including sourcing and ingredient commitments to our guests we have set commitments related to the following food attributes animal welfare chickens raised without medicallyimportant antibiotics cagefree eggs and gestation cratefree pork we are on track to meet our food principles commitments and we continue to monitor progress with our suppliers 

building on our food principles darden established an animal welfare policy that adopts an outcomesbased approach to continue to ensure high level of care for farm animals in the food supply chain in support of the policy we established and convened our first animal welfare council session with key academics and thought leaders with expertise in the care of animals in food supply chains the council advises on and will support darden’s efforts to advance strategy and implementation of an outcomesbased approach from supplier collaborations to reporting improvements the covid19 pandemic has prevented us from additional convening in 2020 but we expect to continue our efforts with the council when feasible

 item 1a risk factors 

various risks and uncertainties could affect our business any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations 

the covid19 pandemic has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt our business which has affected and could continue to materially affect our operations financial condition and results of operations for an extended period of time 

the covid19 pandemic federal state and local government responses to covid19 and our company’s responses to the outbreak have all disrupted and will continue to disrupt our business in the united states individuals are being encouraged to practice social distancing restricted from gathering in groups and for portions of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020  placed on complete restriction from nonessential movements outside of their homes in some areas in response to the covid19 pandemic and these changing conditions during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020  we closed the dining rooms in all of our restaurants for some portion of the quarter and operated in a to go or to go plus delivery format only as of the date of this report we have 890 of our dining rooms open in at least a limited capacity we have closed certain restaurants modified work hours for our team members and identified and implemented cost savings measures throughout our operations as the covid19 pandemic continues to spike in certain areas of the country there could be additional federal state or local responses that restrict inperson dining andor movement of guests or otherwise impact our business the covid19 pandemic and these responses have affected and will continue to adversely affect our guest traffic sales and operating costs and we cannot predict how long the outbreak will last or what other government responses may impact us 

the covid19 pandemic has also adversely affected our ability to open new restaurants due to the uncertainty in the economy and to preserve liquidity we paused nearly all construction of new restaurants and certain remodeling projects at existing restaurants during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020  while we resumed most of these construction projects as of the date of this report these pauses may materially adversely affect our ability to grow our business 

in order to reinforce our liquidity position we entered into a new 2700 million 364day term loan credit agreement in april 2020 a material increase in our level of debt or material impairments of our assets could cause our debt to total capitalization ratio to exceed the maximum level permitted under the covenants in our revolving credit agreement and term loan credit agreement we also raised 5051 million in a public offering of the company’s common stock that closed in april 2020 if the business interruptions caused by covid19 last longer than we expect we may continue to seek other sources of liquidity there can be no guarantee that additional liquidity will be readily available or available on favorable terms especially the longer the covid19 outbreak lasts 

our restaurant operations could be further disrupted if large numbers of our employees are diagnosed with covid19 if a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work whether because of illness quarantine limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with covid19 our operations may be negatively impacted potentially materially adversely affecting our liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

our suppliers could be adversely impacted by the covid19 outbreak if our suppliers’ employees are unable to work whether because of illness quarantine limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with covid19 we could face shortages of food items or other supplies at our restaurants and our operations and sales could be adversely impacted by such supply interruptions we provide ppe to our team members and have added additional supplies of sanitization products to our restaurants for team member and guest use a shortage of supply of ppe or sanitization products could adversely impact our restaurant operations 

additional government regulations or legislation as a result of covid19 in addition to decisions we have made and may make in the future relating to the compensation of and benefit offerings for our restaurant team members could also have an adverse effect on our business we cannot predict the types of additional government regulations or legislation that may be passed relating to employee compensation as a result of the covid19 outbreak we have implemented paid sick leave emergency pay policies and taken other compensation and benefit actions to support our restaurant team members during the covid19 business interruption but those actions may not be sufficient to compensate our team members for the entire duration of the business interruption resulting from covid19 those team members might seek and find other employment during that interruption which could materially adversely affect our ability to properly staff and reopen our restaurants with experienced team members when the business interruptions caused by covid19 abate or end 

health concerns arising from foodrelated pandemics outbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

in addition to the novel coronavirus that causes covid19 the united states and other countries have experienced or may experience in the future outbreaks of other viruses such as norovirus avian flu or “sars” “mers” h1n1 or “swine flu” or other diseases to the extent that a virus or disease is foodborne or perceived to be foodborne future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product or could reduce public confidence in food handling andor public assembly for example public concern over avian flu may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry the inability to serve poultrybased products would restrict our ability to provide a variety of menu items to our guests if we change a restaurant menu in response to such concerns we may lose guests who do not prefer the new menu and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new guest base to produce the sales needed to make the restaurant profitable we also may have different or additional competitors for our intended guests as a result of such a change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors if a virus is transmitted by human contact or respiratory transmission our employees or guests could become infected or could choose or be advised to avoid gathering in public places any of which could adversely affect our restaurant guest traffic and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level we also could be adversely affected if the world health organization andor the cdc were to restrict travel to affected geographic areas where we source our products thus possibly impacting the continuity of supply additionally jurisdictions in which we have restaurants may impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may cause guests to choose other alternatives to dining out in our restaurants which may adversely affect our business 

we rely heavily on information technology in our operations and insufficient guest or employee facing technology or a failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network free from material failure interruption or security breach could harm our ability to effectively operate our business andor result in the loss of respected relationships with our guests or employees 

we rely heavily on information systems across our operations including for ecommerce marketing programs employee engagement management of our supply chain the pointofsale processing system in our restaurants and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability security and capacity of these systems in addition we must effectively respond to changing guest expectations and new technological developments disruptions failures or other performance issues with guest facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our business and negatively affect our relationship with our guests the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems a material network breach in the security of these systems as a result of a cyber attack phishing attack or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to the company our team members or guests this could include the theft of our intellectual property trade secrets or sensitive financial information or the improper use of personal information or other “identity theft” of either guest or employee information some of these essential business processes that are dependent on technology are outsourced to third parties while we make efforts to ensure that our providers are observing proper standards and controls we cannot guarantee that breaches or failures caused by these outsourced providers will not occur 

any such failures disruptions or data privacy breaches may cause delays in guest service reduce efficiency in our operations require significant capital investments to remediate the problem result in customer employee or advertiser dissatisfaction or otherwise result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation we could also be subjected to litigation regulatory investigations or the imposition of penalties as privacy and information security laws and regulations change and cyber risks evolve we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance and protect guest employee and company information 

a failure to maintain food safety throughout the supply chain and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

food safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe quality food products even with strong preventative interventions and controls food safety issues could be caused at the source or by food suppliers or distributors and as a result be out of our control and require prompt action to mitigate impact in addition regardless of the source or cause any report of foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a norovirus or salmonella and other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination at one of our restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our brands and have a negative impact on our sales even instances of foodborne illness food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients resulting in higher costs and lower margins 

the inability to hire train reward and retain restaurant team members and determine and maintain adequate staffing may impact our ability to achieve our operating growth and financial objectives 

our longterm growth depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain highquality team members to work in and manage our restaurants adequate staffing and retention of qualified restaurant team members is a critical factor impacting our guests’ experience in our restaurants maintaining adequate staffing in our existing restaurants and hiring and training staff for our new restaurants requires precise workforce planning which has been complicated by the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our business and on consumer preferences the market for the most qualified talent continues to be competitive and we must provide competitive wages benefits and workplace conditions to maintain our most qualified team members depending on the length of restaurant team member furloughs team members may seek other employment and decline to return when we recall them to work in our restaurants personal or public health concerns related to covid19 might make some existing team members or potential candidates reluctant to work in enclosed restaurant environments a shortage of quality candidates who meet all legal citizenship or work authorization requirements failure to recruit and retain new team members in a timely manner or higher than expected turnover levels all could affect our ability to open new restaurants grow sales at existing restaurants or meet our labor cost objectives an inability to adequately monitor and proactively respond to team member dissatisfaction could lead to poor guest satisfaction higher turnover litigation and unionization which could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

a failure to recruit develop and retain effective leaders or the loss or shortage of personnel with key capacities and skills could impact our strategic direction and jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets 

our future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other leadership team members we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management team members in order to achieve our current business objectives and support our projected growth changes in senior management could expose us to significant changes in strategic direction and initiatives a failure to maintain appropriate organizational capacity and capability to support leadership excellence adequate resources innovative skill sets and expectations and build adequate bench strength required for growth or a loss of key skill sets could jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets 

we are subject to a number of risks relating to public policy changes and federal state and local regulation of our business including in the areas of health care reform environmental matters minimum wage unionization data privacy menu labeling immigration requirements and taxes and an insufficient or ineffective response to legislation or government regulation may impact our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability 

the restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal state local and international laws and regulations the development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites which are subject to building zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations and requirements we are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health sanitation safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food including regulations regarding product safety nutritional content and menu labeling we are subject to federal state and local laws governing employment practices and working conditions these laws cover minimum wage rates wage and hour practices labor relations paid and family leave workplace safety and immigration among others the myriad of laws and regulations being passed at the state and local level creates unique challenges for a multistate employer as different standards apply to different locations sometimes with conflicting requirements we must continue to monitor and adapt our employment practices to comply with these various laws and regulations 

we also are subject to federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities such as the ada compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation new or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our labor costs 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge emission and disposal of hazardous materials there also has been increasing focus by united states and overseas governmental authorities on other environmental matters such as climate change the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption this increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating a yet to be specified array of environmental matters legislative regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials taxes transportation and utilities which could decrease our operating profits and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment 

we are subject to laws relating to information security privacy cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud an increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information including social security numbers financial information including credit card numbers and health information compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and any failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws or any breach of our systems could harm our reputation or lead to litigation which could adversely affect our financial condition 

the impact of current laws and regulations the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues could negatively impact our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal state and local authorities could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings 

litigation including allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees guests suppliers business partners shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation these actions and proceedings may involve allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices including wage and hour violations and employment discrimination guest discrimination food safety issues including poor food quality foodborne illness food tampering food contamination and adverse health effects from consumption of various food products or highcalorie foods including obesity other personal injury including claims related to covid19 violation of “dram shop” laws providing an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or a third party trademark infringement violation of the federal securities laws or other concerns the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time the cost to defend litigation may be significant there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease guest acceptance of our brands regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are found liable litigation could impact our operations in other ways as well allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices for example could adversely affect employee acquisition and retention as a result litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable publicity or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could harm our reputation and adversely impact our guest counts and sales 

the good reputation of our restaurant brands is a key factor in the success of our business actual or alleged incidents at any of our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could harm our brands even incidents occurring at restaurants operated by our competitors or in the supply chain generally could result in negative publicity that could harm the restaurant industry overall and indirectly our own brands negative publicity may result from allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices employee dissatisfaction guest discrimination illness injury or any of the other matters discussed above that could give rise to litigation regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants or to only a single restaurant could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand negative publicity also may result from health concerns including food safety and flu or virus outbreaks publication of government or industry findings concerning food products environmental disasters crime incidents data security breaches scandals involving our employees or operational problems at our restaurants all of which could make our brands and menu offerings less appealing to our guests and negatively impact our guest counts and sales adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of our brands or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business 

there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate each of which may harm our performance prospects or business the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction the dissemination of information online could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations regardless of the information’s accuracy 

  

many of our competitors are expanding their use of social media and new social media platforms are rapidly being developed potentially making more traditional social media platforms obsolete as a result we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies in order to maintain broad appeal with guests and brand relevance as part of our marketing efforts we rely on social media platforms and search engine marketing to attract and retain guests we also continue to invest in other digital marketing initiatives that allow us to reach our guests across multiple digital channels and build their awareness of engagement with and loyalty to our brands these initiatives may not be successful resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues increased employee engagement or brand recognition in addition a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media including the improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about us exposure of personally identifiable information fraud or outofdate information the inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation 

a majority of our restaurants are operated in leased properties and we are committed to longterm and noncancelable leases that we may want to cancel and may be unable to renew the leases that we may want to extend at the end of their terms 

as of may 31 2020  1730 of our 1804 restaurants operating in the united states and canada operate in leased locations if we close a restaurant in a leased location we may remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease which would include among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term additionally the potential losses associated with our inability to cancel leases may result in our keeping open restaurant locations that are performing significantly below targeted levels as a result ongoing lease obligations at closed or underperforming restaurant locations could impair our results of operations in addition at the end of the lease term and expiration of all renewal periods we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost if at all as a result we may be required to close or relocate a restaurant which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks and may have an adverse effect on our operating performance 

we may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs 

our restaurant operations are subject to united states and canadian federal state and local laws governing such matters as minimum wages working conditions overtime and tip credits as federal state and local minimum wage rates increase we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage labor shortages increased employee turnover and health care and other benefit mandates could also increase our labor costs this in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales conversely if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices our profitability may decline in addition the current premiums that we pay for our insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property health and directors’ and officers’ liability may increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs the dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers’ compensation and general liability insurance for which we carry high perclaim deductibles may also increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs further the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses 

our inability or failure to execute on a comprehensive business continuity plan following a major natural disaster such as a hurricane or manmade disaster at our corporate facility could have a materially adverse impact on our business 

many of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one florida location   we have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature including hurricanes and other natural or manmade disasters and back up and offsite locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information however if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans we may experience delays in recovery of data inability to perform vital corporate functions tardiness in required reporting and compliance failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims 

we face intense competition and if we have an insufficient focus on competition and the consumer landscape our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the fullservice dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing service location personnel takeout and delivery options and type and quality of food and there are many wellestablished competitors we compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locallyowned restaurants we also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services particularly in the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées side dishes or meal preparation kits from the deli or prepared foods sections we compete primarily on the quality variety and value perception of menu items the number and location of restaurants type of brand quality and efficiency of service attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors we anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors if we are unable to continue to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are subject to changes in consumer preferences that may adversely affect demand for food at our restaurants 

consumers have continually changing health and dietary preferences as a result our diverse portfolio of restaurant brands are continually challenged to evolve our menu offerings to appeal to these changing customer preferences while maintaining our brand character and retaining popular menu items in response to the covid19 pandemic many consumers have preferred to order food to go or for delivery rather than dining in at fullservice restaurants and if these preferences continue and consumers continue to avoid gathering in public places in large groups we may need to further adapt our offerings to accommodate these changes new information or changes in dietary nutritional allergen or health guidelines or environmental or sustainability concerns whether issued by government agencies academic studies advocacy organizations or similar groups may cause some groups of consumers to select foods other than those that are offered by our restaurants if we fail to anticipate changing trends or other consumer preferences our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our failure to drive both shortterm and longterm profitable sales growth through brand relevance operating excellence opening new restaurants of existing brands and acquiring new restaurant brands could result in poor financial performance 

as part of our business strategy we intend to drive profitable sales growth by increasing samerestaurant sales at existing restaurants continuing to expand our current portfolio of restaurant brands and acquiring additional brands that can be expanded profitably this strategy involves numerous risks and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives 

at existing brands we may not be able to maintain brand relevance and restaurant operating excellence to achieve sustainable samerestaurant sales growth and warrant new unit growth existing brand shortterm sales growth could be impacted if we are unable to drive near term guest count and sales growth and longterm sales growth could be impacted if we fail to extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to our guests a failure to innovate and extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to guests and occasions in order to generate sustainable samerestaurant traffic growth and produce nontraditional sales and earnings growth opportunities insufficient focus on our competition or failure to adequately address declines in the casual dining industry could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition we may not be able to support sustained new unit growth or open all of our planned new restaurants and the new restaurants that we open may not be profitable or as profitable as our existing restaurants new restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize and even sales at successful newlyopened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation the opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on guest counts and sales levels at existing restaurants 

the ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations the need to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses on a timely basis the need to comply with other regulatory requirements the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay construction increases in labor and building material costs the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms changes in weather or other acts of god that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions at each potential location we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites construction contractors management personnel hourly employees and other resources if we are unable to successfully manage these risks we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated sales and earnings in future periods 

we also may not be able to identify and successfully acquire and integrate additional brands that are as profitable as our existing restaurants or that provide potential for further growth 

a lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

the success of our restaurants depends in large part on their locations as demographic and economic patterns change current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations in addition desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation the occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may experience higherthananticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants we incur substantial preopening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close relocate or remodel existing restaurants the expenses of opening closing relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated an increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

a failure to identify and execute innovative marketing and guest relationship tactics ineffective or improper use of other marketing initiatives and increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

if our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions if our advertising media or marketing expenses increase if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors or if we do not adequately leverage technology and data analytic capabilities needed to generate concise competitive insight we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations a failure to sufficiently innovate develop guest relationship initiatives or maintain adequate and effective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales 

as part of our marketing efforts we rely on social media platforms and search engine marketing to attract and retain guests these initiatives may not be successful and pose a variety of other risks as discussed above under the heading “our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business” 

a failure to address cost pressures including rising costs for commodities labor health care and utilities used by our restaurants and a failure to effectively deliver cost management activities and achieve economies of scale in purchasing could compress our margins and adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food ingredients labor health care utilities and other related costs over which we may have little control operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities including beef pork chicken seafood cheese butter and produce the introduction of or changes to tariffs on imported food products such as produce and seafood could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products we cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices menu offerings and menu prices and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results we attempt to leverage our size to achieve economies of scale in purchasing but there can be no assurances that we can always do so effectively we are also subject to the general risks of inflation 

increases in minimum wage health care and other benefit costs may have a material adverse effect on our labor costs we operate in many states and localities where the minimum wage is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage increases in minimum wage may also result in increases in the wage rates paid for nonminimum wage positions many states and localities are also passing laws regulating employment practices and working conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our labor costs in those areas 

our restaurants’ operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as electricity and natural gas whether as a result of inflation or otherwise on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply in addition interruptions to the availability of gas electric water or other utilities whether due to aging infrastructure weather conditions fire animal damage trees digging accidents or other reasons largely out of our control may adversely affect our operations our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may lose sales or incur increased costs if our restaurants experience shortages delays or interruptions in the delivery of food and other products from our third party vendors and suppliers 

shortages delays or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants may be caused by inclement weather natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods droughts and earthquakes labor issues or other operational disruptions at our suppliers vendors or other service providers the inability of our vendors or service providers to manage adverse business conditions obtain credit or remain solvent or other conditions beyond our control such shortages delays or interruptions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants we have a limited number of suppliers and distributors for certain of our products and services supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our restaurant operations if we raise prices as a result of increased food costs or shortages it may negatively impact our sales if we temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular items from a restaurant’s menu that restaurant may experience a significant reduction in sales during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our guests changing their dining habits 

adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could adversely affect our restaurant sales 

adverse weather conditions can impact guest traffic at our restaurants cause the temporary underutilization of outdoor patio seating and in more severe cases such as hurricanes tornadoes or other natural disasters cause temporary closures sometimes for prolonged periods which would negatively impact our restaurant sales changes in weather could result in construction delays interruptions to the availability of utilities and shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies which could increase our costs some climatologists predict that the longterm effects of climate change and global warming may result in more severe volatile weather or extended droughts which could increase the frequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we may use to hedge exposures to fluctuations in commodity and broader market prices may cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we use or may use derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our principal ingredient labor and energy costs including but not limited to coffee butter wheat soybean oil pork beef diesel fuel gasoline and natural gas changes in the values of these derivatives may be recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings included in our consolidated financial statements 

volatility in the united states equity markets affects our ability to efficiently hedge exposures to our market risk related to equitybased compensation awards 

the equity markets in the united states have been extremely volatile due to the covid19 pandemic and the recessionary cycle affecting the united states economy and the company’s stock price has fluctuated significantly we have equity hedges in place to protect the company from exposure to market risk related to future payout of equitybased compensation awards however because these hedges also net settle on a cash basis quarterly we have been and may in the future be required to make cash payments at those quarterly settlement dates and the amounts of those payments are difficult to predict due to the recent extreme volatility of the equity markets these cash payments may ultimately be offset by payments to us from the hedge counterparties or reductions in expected payouts to employees when those equity hedges finally fully settle and the related equity awards pay out 

certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and other general macroeconomic factors including unemployment energy prices and interest rates that are largely beyond our control may adversely affect consumer behavior and our results of operations 

our business results depend on a number of industryspecific and general economic factors many of which are beyond our control the fullservice dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in international national regional and local economic conditions seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant brands the performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends severe weather including hurricanes traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants 

general economic conditions including economic downturns related to the covid19 pandemic have also adversely affected our results of operations and may continue to do so the current economic recession a protracted economic slowdown a worsening economy increased unemployment increased energy prices rising interest rates a downgrade of the us government’s longterm credit rating imposition of retaliatory tariffs on important us imports and exports or other industrywide cost pressures have affected and can continue to affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and 

lead to a decline in sales and earnings job losses foreclosures bankruptcies and falling home prices have caused and may continue to cause guests to make fewer discretionary purchases and any significant decrease in our guest traffic or average profit per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance in addition if gasoline natural gas electricity and other energy costs increase and credit card home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency of their dining occasions may spend less on each dining occasion or may choose more inexpensive restaurants 

furthermore we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts terrorist attacks efforts to combat terrorism heightened security requirements or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems could have on our operations the economy or consumer confidence generally any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures 

unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our guests could increase our costs reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact consumer spending patterns and affect the availability and cost of credit 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control turmoil in global credit markets could adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future there can be no assurances that we will be able to arrange credit on terms we believe are acceptable or that permit us to finance our business with historical margins a lack of credit could have an adverse impact on certain of our suppliers landlords and other tenants in retail centers in which we are located if these issues occur they could negatively affect our financial results any new disruptions in the financial markets may also adversely affect the us and world economy which could negatively impact consumer spending patterns 

we face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees and licensees 

certain of our domestic and all of our international locations other than in canada are operated by franchisees or licensees we believe that we have selected highcaliber operating partners and franchisees with significant experience in restaurant operations and are providing them with training and support however the probability of opening ultimate success and quality of any franchise or licensed restaurant rests principally with the franchisee or licensee if the franchisee or licensee does not successfully open and operate its restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards or guests have negative experiences due to issues with food quality or operational execution our brand values could suffer which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we face a variety of risks associated with doing business with business partners and vendors in foreign markets 

we are making efforts to expand our brands overseas through licensing and franchising relationships there is no assurance that international operations will be profitable or that international growth will continue our international operations are subject to all of the same risks associated with our domestic operations as well as a number of additional risks these include among other things international economic and political conditions foreign currency fluctuations and differing cultures and consumer preferences in addition expansion into international markets could create risks to our brands and reputation 

we also are subject to governmental regulations throughout the world that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors these include antitrust and tax requirements antiboycott regulations importexportcustoms regulations and other international trade regulations the usa patriot act the foreign corrupt practices act and applicable local law failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business 

we regard our olive garden ®  longhorn steakhouse ®  cheddar’s scratch kitchen ®  yard house ®  the capital grille ®  the capital burger ®  seasons 52 ®  bahama breeze ®  eddie v’s prime seafood ®  darden ® and darden restaurants ® service marks and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts copyrights patents trademarks service marks and other common law rights such as trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our restaurants and services from infringement we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the united states and foreign jurisdictions however 

we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other persons although our policy is to oppose any such infringement further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources 

impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment of goodwill exists factors may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and slower growth rates any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations we compute the amount of impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of that reporting unit we are required to record a noncash impairment charge if the testing performed indicates that goodwill has been impaired 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets primarily the longhorn steakhouse ®  cheddar’s scratch kitchen ®  the capital grille ®  yard house ® and eddie v’s prime seafood ® trademarks to determine if they are definite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

as with goodwill we test our indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable subsequent to our fiscal 2020 annual analysis we identified an indication of impairment related to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic requiring us to assess our goodwill and trademarks for impairment as of may 31 2020 as a result of these analyses we recorded impairments of our cheddar’s scratch kitchen ® trademark and the related goodwill from acquiring that brand we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any further impairments of these or other assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in tax laws or treaties and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions our effective income tax rate and other taxes in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws or other legislative changes certain international tax treaties and the outcome of income tax audits although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of a tax audit could have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made in addition our effective income tax rate and our results may be impacted by our ability to realize deferred tax benefits and by any increases or decreases of our valuation allowances applied to our existing deferred tax assets 

failure of our internal controls over financial reporting and future changes in accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results affect our reported results of operations or otherwise harm our business and financial results

overview of operations 

our business operates in the fullservice dining segment of the restaurant industry at may 31 2020  we operated 1804 restaurants through subsidiaries in the united states and canada under the olive garden ®  longhorn steakhouse ®  cheddar’s scratch kitchen ®  yard house ®  the capital grille ®  seasons 52 ®  bahama breeze ® and eddie v’s prime seafood ® trademarks we own and operate all of our restaurants in the united states and canada except for 3 joint venture restaurants managed by us and 30 franchised restaurants we also have 32 franchised restaurants in operation located in latin america and the middle east all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

covid19 pandemic 

in march 2020 the covid19 outbreak was declared a national public health emergency resulting in a significant reduction in guest traffic at our restaurants due to changes in consumer behavior as public health officials encouraged social distancing and state and local governments mandated restrictions including suspension of dinein operations reduced restaurant seating capacity table spacing requirements bar closures and additional physical barriers through the first three quarters of fiscal 2020 our financial results were strong as sales from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2020 were 654 billion an increase of 41 percent over the prior year period the covid19 pandemic negatively impacted this strong performance and for most of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we operated with all of our dining rooms closed and served our guests in a to go only or to go and delivery format our sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 declined 430 percent from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 as we continue to navigate through the pandemic we have taken significant steps to adapt our business to allow us to continue to serve guests support our team members and secure our liquidity position to provide financial flexibility including 

 the impact on our operating results as well as the operational and financial measures we have implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic have been included throughout this document as a result of the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we recorded noncash impairment charges of 3900 million related to a portion of our goodwill other indefinitelived intangible assets and other assets see note 1 and note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report for additional information additionally on march 27 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act was signed into law in the united states the provisions of the cares act provide for among other items refundable employee retention tax credits for which we intend to claim 392 million related to our emergency pay program mentioned above see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report for additional information 

in late april 2020 state and local governments began to allow us to open dining rooms at limited capacities along with other operating restrictions and as of the date of filing this report 890 percent of our restaurants were able to open their dining 

rooms to some extent while increasing our inrestaurant dining capacity is subject to the ordinances in the jurisdictions we operate we are focused on increasing capacity where possible continuing to provide a safe environment for our team members and guests and maintaining many of the efficiencies established over these past few months for most of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 our cash flows from operations were negative but by the end of the quarter with the increasing dining room capacity we were back to near breakeven cash flow levels although we expect our restaurants’ dining room capacity to increase as public health conditions improve and restrictions are eased it is possible additional outbreaks could require us to reduce our capacity or further suspend our inrestaurant dining operations 

we believe that capable operators of strong multiunit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the restaurant industry’s fullservice segment generally the restaurant industry is considered to be comprised of three segments quick service fast casual and full service all of our restaurants fall within the fullservice segment which is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains we believe we have strong brands and that the breadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the fullservice segment of the restaurant industry this collective capability is the product of investments over many years in areas that are critical to success in our business including restaurant operations excellence brand management excellence supply chain talent management and information technology among other things 

although the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 required us to focus on adapting our business to account for the impacts of covid19 our longterm operating philosophy remains focused on strengthening the core operational fundamentals of the business by providing an outstanding guest experience rooted in culinary innovation attentive service engaging atmosphere and integrated marketing the darden support structure enables our brands to achieve their ultimate potential through 1 driving advantages in supply chain and general and administrative support 2 applying insights collected from our significant guest and transactional databases to enhance guest relationships and identify new opportunities to drive sales growth 3 relentlessly driving operating efficiencies and continuous improvement operating with a sense of urgency and inspiring a performancedriven culture and 4 our commitment to rigorous strategic planning 

we seek to increase profits by leveraging our fixed and semifixed costs with sales from new restaurants and increased guest traffic and sales at existing restaurants to evaluate our operations and assess our financial performance we monitor a number of operating measures with a special focus on two key factors 

  

 increasing samerestaurant sales can improve segment profit because these incremental sales provide better leverage of our fixed and semifixed restaurantlevel costs a restaurant brand can generate samerestaurant sales increases through increases in guest traffic increases in the average guest check or a combination of the two the average guest check can be impacted by menu price changes and by the mix of menu items sold for each restaurant brand we gather daily sales data and regularly analyze the guest traffic counts and the mix of menu items sold to aid in developing menu pricing product offerings and promotional strategies we focus on balancing our pricing and product offerings with other initiatives to produce sustainable samerestaurant sales growth we compute samerestaurant sales using restaurants open at least 16 months because this period is generally required for new restaurant sales levels to normalize sales at newly opened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation due to operating or integration inefficiencies our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of new restaurant openings and closings and relocations and remodeling of existing restaurants preopening expenses each period reflect the costs associated with opening new restaurants in current and future periods 

fiscal 2020 financial highlights 

our sales from continuing operations were 781 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to 851 billion in fiscal 2019  the 83 percent decrease in sales from continuing operations was primarily driven by negative combined darden samerestaurant sales of 110 percent partially offset by revenue from the addition of 19 net new companyowned restaurants the decrease in sales was driven by the impact of covid19 on our fourth quarter results in fiscal 2020 which declined 430 percent from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 

net loss from continuing operations for fiscal 2020 was 492 million  040 per diluted share compared with net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2019 of 7186 million  573 per diluted share our results from continuing operations for fiscal 2020 decreased compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the economic impacts of covid19 which had a material adverse effect on the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020  

our net loss from discontinued operations was 32 million  003 per diluted share for fiscal 2020  compared with a net loss from discontinued operations of 52 million  004 per diluted share for fiscal 2019  when combined with results from 

continuing operations our diluted net loss per share was 043 for fiscal 2020 and diluted net earnings per share was 569 for fiscal 2019  

outlook 

while it is our normal practice to provide an annual financial outlook given the level of volatility and uncertainty surrounding the future impact of the covid19 outbreak measures taken to control its spread the broader us economy and any specific impact on our financial results we are providing only a limited outlook for fiscal 2021 

in fiscal 2021  we expect to open 3540 net new restaurants and we expect capital expenditures incurred to build new restaurants remodel and maintain existing restaurants and technology initiatives to be between 2500 million and 3000 million

fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019  

 income taxes 

the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2020 and 2019 for continuing operations were 694 percent and 81 percent  respectively during fiscal 2020 we had an income tax benefit of 1118 million compared to income tax expense of 637 million in fiscal 2019 the significant change was driven primarily by our net loss from continuing operations in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of certain tax credits on our lower earnings before income taxes 

net earnings and net earnings per share from continuing operations 

net loss from continuing operations for fiscal 2020 was 492 million  040 per diluted share compared with net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2019 of 7186 million  573 per diluted share

segment results 

we manage our restaurant brands olive garden longhorn steakhouse cheddar’s scratch kitchen yard house the capital grille seasons 52 bahama breeze and eddie v’s in the us and canada as operating segments we aggregate our operating segments into reportable segments based on a combination of the size economic characteristics and subsegment of fullservice dining within which each brand operates our four reportable segments are 1 olive garden 2 longhorn steakhouse 3 fine dining and 4 other business see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report for further details 

our management uses segment profit as the measure for assessing performance of our segments the following table presents segment profit margin for the periods indicated 



the decrease in the olive garden longhorn steakhouse fine dining and other business’ segment profit margins for fiscal 2020 was driven primarily by negative samerestaurant sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 resulting from the economic impact of covid19 

results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared to 2018 

for a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended may 26 2019 and may 27 2018  see “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended may 26 2019  filed with the sec on july 19 2019 

seasonality 

our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally typically our average sales per restaurant are highest in the winter and spring followed by the summer and lowest in the fall holidays changes in the economy severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions because of the seasonality of our business results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year we are not able to predict the impact that the covid19 pandemic may have on the seasonality of our business 

impact of inflation 

we attempt to minimize the annual effects of inflation through appropriate planning operating practices and menu price increases we do not believe inflation had a significant overall effect on our annual results of operations during fiscal 2020 or 2019  

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions we consider the following estimates to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

leases 

we evaluate our leases at their inception to estimate their expected term which commences on the date when we have the right to control the use of the leased property and includes the noncancelable base term plus all option periods we are reasonably certain to exercise our judgment in determining the appropriate expected term and discount rate for each lease affects our evaluation of 

 these judgments may produce materially different amounts of lease liabilities and rightofuse assets recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as well as depreciation amortization interest and rent expense recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings if different discount rates and expected lease terms were used 

valuation of longlived assets 

land buildings and equipment operating lease rightofuse assets and certain other assets including definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows unanticipated competition slower growth rates ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets or changes in the usage or operating performance any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we identified indicators of impairment of our longlived assets due to covid19 including but not limited to significant decline in cash flows significant decline in sales and overall challenging environment for the restaurant industry due to the mandated suspension of dinein operations and other restrictions such as table spacing requirements due to the indicators that were present throughout our fourth quarter we deemed it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred in our longlived assets and performed impairment testing as of may 31 2020 as a result of our impairment test we recorded pretax noncash impairment charges of 470 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 related to 11 underperforming restaurants we permanently closed during the quarter and 9 other restaurants whose projected cash flows were not sufficient to cover their respective carrying values 

significant judgment was used in estimating both the recoverability of the carrying value and fair value of the longlived assets 



valuation and recoverability of goodwill and trademarks 

we have eight reporting units six of which had goodwill and seven of which had trademarks goodwill and trademarks are not subject to amortization and goodwill has been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing the reporting units are our restaurant brands a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and slower growth rates any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements we review our goodwill and trademarks for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 

we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using the best information available including market information also referred to as the market approach and discounted cash flow projections also referred to as the income approach a market approach estimates fair value by applying sales or cash flow multiples to the reporting unit’s operating performance the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units the income approach uses a reporting unit’s projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects current market conditions we recognize a goodwill impairment loss when the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

we estimate the fair value of trademarks using the relieffromroyalty method which requires assumptions related to projected sales from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademarks and a discount rate we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value 

we performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill and trademarks as of february 24 2020 which was the first day of our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter as of february 24 2020 no impairment of goodwill or trademarks was indicated based on our testing however subsequent to our annual test date we identified indicators of impairment due to the covid19 pandemic including but not limited to stock price volatility in general the volatility of our stock price as well as our competitors the significant decline in our market capitalization declining sales at our restaurants and the challenging environment for the restaurant industry due to the mandated suspension of dinein operations and other restrictions such as table spacing requirements due to the indicators that were present throughout our fourth quarter we deemed it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred in both our goodwill and trademark balances and performed impairment testing as of may 31 2020 to determine if the fair values were less than their carrying values due to the economic impact of covid19 on darden’s overall market capitalization and the impact on cheddar’s scratch kitchen’s projected sales and cash flows we determined that both the estimated fair values of the trademark and the reporting unit for cheddar’s scratch kitchen were less than their respective carrying values as a result we recorded in our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter pretax noncash impairment charges of 1450 million and 1692 million related to the cheddar’s scratch kitchen trademark and goodwill balances respectively the fair value of our remaining reporting units exceeded their carrying values by at least 30 percent and the trademark fair value of our remaining reporting units exceeded their carrying values by at least 40 percent 

significant judgment was used when performing our impairment testing of goodwill and trademarks including the following estimates 

 a key assumption in our goodwill impairment test was the wacc utilized for discounting our estimated future cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units under the income approach a key assumption in our trademark impairment test was the discount rate utilized in the relieffromroyalty method the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a onepercentage 

point change in the wacc and discount rate assumptions for goodwill and trademark valuation models for our material reporting unit balances 



impairment of our assets including goodwill or trademarks adversely affects our financial position and results of operations and our leverage ratio for purposes of our revolving credit agreement revolving credit agreement increases a leverage ratio exceeding the maximum permitted under our revolving credit agreement would be a default under our revolving credit agreement at may 31 2020  additional writedowns of goodwill other indefinitelived intangible assets or any other assets in excess of approximately 110 billion would have been required to cause our leverage ratio to exceed the permitted maximum as our leverage ratio is determined on a quarterly basis and due to the seasonal nature of our business a lesser amount of impairment in future quarters could cause our leverage ratio to exceed the permitted maximum 

unearned revenues 

unearned revenues primarily represent our liability for gift cards that have been sold but not yet redeemed the estimated value of gift cards expected to remain unused is recognized over the expected period of redemption as the remaining gift card values are redeemed generally over a period of 12 years utilizing this method we estimate both the amount of breakage and the time period of redemption if actual redemption patterns vary from our estimates actual gift card breakage income may differ from the amounts recorded we update our estimates of our redemption period and our breakage rate periodically and apply that rate to gift card redemptions on a prospective basis changing our breakagerate estimates by 50 basis points would have resulted in an adjustment in our breakage income of approximately 31 million for fiscal 2020 

income taxes 

we estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes these estimates include among other items depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported employee tip income effective rates for state and local income taxes and the tax deductibility of certain other items we adjust our annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available 

assessment of uncertain tax positions requires judgments relating to the amounts timing and likelihood of resolution as described in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report the 216 million balance of unrecognized tax benefits at may 31 2020  includes 62 million related to tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts could change during the next 12 months based on the outcome of examinations the 62 million relates to items that would impact our effective income tax rate 

liquidity and capital resources 

typically cash flows generated from operating activities are our principal source of liquidity which we use to finance capital expenditures for new restaurants and to remodel and maintain existing restaurants to pay dividends to our shareholders and to repurchase shares of our common stock since substantially all of our sales are for cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable are generally paid in 5 to 90 days we are typically able to carry current liabilities in excess of current assets as previously noted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 all of our restaurants began operating at reduced capacities due to the covid19 outbreak and may not be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to cover all of our projected expenditures while operating at these reduced capacities accordingly in response to the current conditions we have suspended our dividend until further notice and suspended our share repurchase activity to secure our liquidity position and provide financial flexibility during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we drew the full 7500 million from our revolving credit agreement secured 270 million through a term loan agreement and received 5051 million in net proceeds in a followon equity offering we subsequently fully repaid the 7500 million drawn from our revolving credit agreement see below for additional information 

we currently manage our business and financial ratios to target an investmentgrade bond rating which has historically allowed flexible access to financing at reasonable costs our publicly issued longterm debt currently carries the following ratings 

 our commercial paper has ratings of 

 

these ratings are as of the date of the filing of this report and have been obtained with the understanding that moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch will continue to monitor our credit and make future adjustments to these ratings to the extent warranted the ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our securities may be changed superseded or withdrawn at any time and should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

we maintain a 7500 million revolving credit agreement with bank of america na boa as administrative agent and the lenders and other agents party thereto the revolving credit agreement is a senior unsecured credit commitment to the company and contains customary representations and affirmative and negative covenants including limitations on liens and subsidiary debt and a maximum consolidated lease adjusted total debt to total capitalization ratio of 075 to 100 and events of default usual for credit facilities of this type as of may 31 2020  we were in compliance with all covenants under the revolving credit agreement 

the revolving credit agreement matures on october 27 2022  and the proceeds may be used for working capital and capital expenditures the refinancing of certain indebtedness certain acquisitions and general corporate purposes loans under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at a rate of libor plus a margin determined by reference to a ratingsbased pricing grid applicable margin or the base rate which is defined as the highest of the boa prime rate plus 0075 percent the federal funds rate plus 0500 percent  and the eurocurrency rate plus 1075 percent  plus the applicable margin assuming a “bbb” equivalent credit rating level the applicable margin under the revolving credit agreement will be 1075 percent for libor loans and 0075 percent for base rate loans as noted above on march 17 2020 we borrowed the full 7500 million available under the revolving credit agreement and fully repaid the borrowing on may 5 2020 as of may 31 2020  we had no outstanding balances under the revolving credit agreement 

on april 6 2020 we entered into a 2700 million 364day term loan credit agreement the term loan agreement with boa as administrative agent and the lenders and other agents party thereto the term loan agreement is a senior unsecured obligation of the company and contains customary representations and affirmative and negative covenants including limitations on liens and subsidiary debt and a maximum consolidated total debt to total capitalization ratio of 075 to 100 the term loan agreement also contains events of default customary for credit agreements of this type 

  

the term loan agreement was fully drawn on april 6 2020 and matures on april 5 2021 and the proceeds may be used for working capital and capital expenditures the refinancing of certain indebtedness certain acquisitions and general corporate purposes the term loan agreement includes a covenant that we will not use the proceeds to pay any cash dividends to shareholders or to repurchase our common stock the term loan agreement also contains a provision that allows existing lenders to increase their loans and additional lenders to join the term loan agreement after the april 6 2020 closing date and to make 

additional loans up to a total principal amount of 3700 million no such increases or additional loans have been made as of the date of the filing of this report interest rates on borrowings under the term loan agreement will be based on prevailing interest rates as described in the term loan agreement and in part upon our credit ratings applicable interest rates under the term loan agreement may be modified in the event of a change in the rating of our longterm senior unsecured debt the applicable interest rate for this loan at may 31 2020 was 3750 percent  

at may 31 2020  our longterm debt consisted principally of 

 the interest rate on our 428 million 6800 percent senior notes due october 2037 is subject to adjustment from time to time if the debt rating assigned to such series of notes is downgraded below a certain rating level or subsequently upgraded the maximum adjustment is 2000 percent above the initial interest rate and the interest rate cannot be reduced below the initial interest rate as of may 31 2020  no such adjustments are made to this rate 

through our shelf registration statement on file with the sec depending on conditions prevailing in the public capital markets we may issue equity securities or unsecured debt securities from time to time in one or more series which may consist of notes debentures or other evidences of indebtedness in one or more offerings 

from time to time we may repurchase our outstanding debt in privately negotiated transactions such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements and other factors 

from time to time we enter into interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk inherent in our operations see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report 

a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at may 31 2020  is as follows 





 our adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio was 61 percent and 58 percent as of may 31 2020 and may 26 2019  respectively based on these ratios we believe our financial condition is strong we include the leasedebt equivalent and contractual lease guarantees in our adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio reported to shareholders as we believe its inclusion better represents the optimal capital structure that we target from period to period and because it is consistent with the calculation of the covenant under our revolving credit agreement 

in fiscal 2020 we amended our revolving credit agreement to update certain terms in the definition of the leasedebt equivalent made obsolete due to our adoption of financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic 842 leases in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 the amendment has not resulted in a material change in our financial covenant under the revolving credit agreement nor in our compliance with that covenant for fiscal 2020 the leasedebt equivalent includes 600 times the total annual minimum rent for consolidated lease obligations of  3926 million  for fiscal 2019 the leasedebt equivalent includes 600 times the combined total annual minimum rent for operating leases and annual minimum lease payments for financing leases on a consolidated basis of 3595 million  the composition of our capital structure is shown in the following table

net cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations were 5440 million in fiscal 2020 compared to net cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations of 4626 million in fiscal 2019  capital expenditures incurred principally for building new restaurants remodeling existing restaurants replacing equipment and technology initiatives were 4599 million in fiscal 2020  compared to 4520 million in fiscal 2019  net cash flows used in investing activities for fiscal 2020 also reflect net cash used of 558 million in the acquisition of cheddar’s scratch kitchen restaurants from existing franchisees

we are not aware of any trends or events that would materially affect our capital requirements or liquidity we believe that our internal cashgenerating capabilities the potential issuance of equity or unsecured debt securities under our shelf registration statement and shortterm commercial paper or drawings under our revolving credit agreement should be sufficient to finance our capital expenditures debt maturities and other operating activities through fiscal 2021  due to the impacts of covid19 on our financial position we have currently suspended dividends and share repurchases however we intend to review our dividend policy and share repurchases as conditions warrant potentially during fiscal 2021 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are not a party to any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition sales or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

financial condition 

our total current assets were 110 billion at may 31 2020  compared with 8926 million at may 26 2019  the increase was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents driven by net proceeds from the issuance of shortterm debt and proceeds from a followon equity offering offset by repurchases of common stock and dividends paid and lower cash from operations due to the economic impact of covid19 

our total current liabilities were 179 billion at may 31 2020  compared with 147 billion at may 26 2019  the increase was primarily due to an increase in short term debt as well as an increase in other current liabilities due to the operating lease liability recorded as a result of the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance

strategy 

we believe that capable operators of strong multiunit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the restaurant industry’s fullservice segment generally the restaurant industry is considered to be comprised of three segments quick service fast casual and fullservice all of our restaurants fall within the fullservice segment which is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains we believe we have strong brands and that the breadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the fullservice restaurant industry this collective capability is the product of investments over many years in areas that are critical to success in our business including restaurant operations excellence brand management excellence supply chain talent management and information technology among other things 

during fiscal 2019  our operating philosophy remained focused on strengthening the core operational fundamentals of the business by providing an outstanding guest experience rooted in culinary innovation attentive service engaging atmosphere and integrated marketing darden enables each brand to reach its full potential by leveraging its scale insights and experience in a way that protects uniqueness and competitive advantages additionally brands can capitalize on data insights to deliver customized onetoone customer relationship marketing we hold ourselves accountable for operating our restaurants with a sense of urgency to achieve our commitments to all of our stakeholders 

recent and planned restaurant growth 

during fiscal 2019  we added 39 net new companyowned restaurants in the united states our fiscal 2019 actual restaurant openings and closings fiscal 2020 projected openings and approximate capital investment square footage and dining capacity by brand are shown below 



 

while our objective is to continue to expand all of our restaurant brands the actual number of openings for each of our brands for fiscal 2020 will depend on many factors including our ability to locate appropriate sites negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms obtain necessary local governmental permits complete construction and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel 

we consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant’s longterm success and we devote significant effort to the site selection process prior to entering a market we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors these factors include trade area demographics such as target population density and household income levels competitive influences in the trade area the site’s visibility accessibility and traffic volume and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls hotelmotel complexes offices and universities members of senior management evaluate inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after the site is acquired and permits are obtained 

we systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards when a restaurant falls below minimum standards we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes and implement operational and marketing plans to improve that restaurant’s performance if performance does not improve to acceptable levels the restaurant is evaluated for relocation closing or conversion to one of our other brands permanent closures are typically due to economic changes in trade areas the expiration of lease agreements or site concerns accordingly we continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges 

restaurant operations 

we believe that highquality restaurant management is critical to our longterm success our restaurant management structure varies by brand and restaurant size we issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards 

each olive garden restaurant is led by a general manager and each longhorn steakhouse restaurant is led by a managing partner each also has three to five additional managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant in addition each restaurant typically employs between 60 to 120 hourly team members most of whom work parttime restaurant general managers or managing partners report to a director of operations who is responsible for approximately seven to ten restaurants each director of operations of olive garden and longhorn steakhouse reports to a senior vice president of operations who is responsible for approximately one hundred restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by operations management including officer level executives to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards

we maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our managementlevel team members we believe that our leadership position strong resultsoriented culture and various shortterm and longterm incentive programs including stockbased compensation enhances our ability to attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers 

quality assurance 

our total quality department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe highquality food in a clean and safe environment through rigorous supplier and riskbased product evaluations we purchase only products that meet or exceed our product specifications we rely on independent third parties to inspect and evaluate our suppliers and distributors suppliers that produce “highrisk” products are subject to a food safety evaluation by darden personnel at least annually we require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive hazard analysis and critical control point haccp food safety programs and riskbased preventative controls adopted by the us food and drug administration these programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause foodborne illnesses by applying scientificallybased controls to analyze hazards identify and monitor critical control points and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met we require routine food safety verification for highrisk products from our suppliers our total quality managers and third party auditors visit each restaurant regularly throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation the total quality managers also serve as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety 

purchasing and distribution 

our ability to ensure a consistent supply of safe highquality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant brands depends on reliable sources of procurement our purchasing staff sources negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 1500 suppliers whose products originate in more than 35 countries suppliers must meet our requirements and strict quality control standards in the development harvest catch and production of food products competitive bids longterm contracts and strategic supplier relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products 

we believe that our significant scale is a competitive advantage and our purchasing team leverages this purchasing capability our purchasing staff travels routinely within the united states and internationally to source topquality food products at competitive prices we believe that we have established excellent longterm relationships with key suppliers and usually source our product directly from producers not brokers or middlemen we actively support several national minority supplier organizations to ensure that we incorporate women and minorityowned businesses in our purchasing decisions 

we have entered into longterm agreements with multiple third party national distribution companies to deliver food and supplies to our restaurants under these arrangements we maintain ownership of the food and supplies inventory through our subsidiary darden direct distribution inc darden direct this inventory is stored in distribution company warehouses that are wholly or primarily dedicated to darden where practical to do so because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales 

we continue to drive automation of our supply chain by collaborating with our suppliers logistics partners and distributors to improve optimization with information visibility and other technological advances these and other terms of darden direct’s longterm supply agreements further enable our purchasing staff to integrate demand forecasts into our purchasing operations driving efficiencies in our operations 

advertising and marketing 

integrated marketing is a key element of our strategy and our scale enables us to be a leading advertiser in the fullservice dining segment of the restaurant industry olive garden leverages the efficiency of national network television advertising supplemented with cable local television and digital advertising longhorn steakhouse uses local television and digital advertising to build engagement and loyalty by market cheddar’s scratch kitchen yard house the capital grille seasons 52 bahama breeze and eddie v’s do not use television advertising but rely on local and digital marketing our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to build awareness and strengthen our brands’ relevance we implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase our sales and profits as well as increase frequency of visitation by our guests we also rely on outdoor billboard direct mail and email advertising as well as radio newspapers digital coupons search engine marketing and social media such as facebook® and instagram® as appropriate to attract engage and retain our guests we have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor guest satisfaction and evolving food service trends and expectations 

in fiscal 2019  we continued a multiyear effort to implement new technology platforms that allow us to digitally engage with our guests and team members and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities in an increasingly connected society we also continued making improvements to our online and mobile ordering system for olive garden and longhorn steakhouse in addition we continued working on developing sophisticated customer relationship management programs data analytics and datadriven marketing approaches to effectively and efficiently target our existing and potential guests across our portfolio of brands this enables us to tailor messaging and offerings depending on guest visit history preferences and brand loyalty 

employees 

at the end of fiscal 2019  we employed approximately 185000 people team members in the united states and canada of these team members approximately 170000 were hourly restaurant personnel the remainder were restaurant management personnel located in the restaurants or in the field or were located at our restaurant support center facility in orlando florida our executives have an average of 15 years of experience with us the restaurant general managers and managing partners average 13 years with us we believe that we provide working conditions and compensation that compare favorably with those of our competitors most team members other than restaurant management and corporate management are paid on an hourly basis none of our team members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our employee relations to be good 

as a fullservice restaurant company food is always top of mind but our team members make the difference they are at the heart of everything we do we believe the guest experience can never exceed the team member experience so we hire the best and retain them by fostering an environment of respect where diversity of thought and background is valued and everyone has the opportunity to develop and grow their careers we offer our team members flexible work schedules and competitive wages and benefits 

consistent with one of our core values of diversity we are committed to attracting retaining engaging and developing a workforce that mirrors the diversity of our guests approximately 51 percent of our restaurant team members are minorities and 55 percent are female additionally we employ members of five generations of the united states population traditionalists baby boomers generation x millennials and centennials

information technology and cybersecurity 

we strive for leadership in the restaurant business by using technology as a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy we have implemented technologyenabled business solutions to improve financial control cost management guest service and employee effectiveness as well as enable ecommerce these solutions are designed to be used across restaurant brands yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant brand our strategy is to fully integrate systems to drive operational efficiencies and enable restaurant teams to focus on restaurant operations excellence restaurant hardware and software support for all of our restaurant brands is provided or coordinated from the restaurant support center facility in orlando florida our data network sends and receives business data to and from the restaurants throughout the day and night providing timely and extensive information on business activity in every location our data center contains sufficient computing power to process information from all restaurants quickly and efficiently our information is processed in a secure environment to protect both our data and the physical computing assets we guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan which includes storing critical business information offsite testing the disaster recovery plan at a hostsite facility and providing onsite power backup we also conduct a thirdparty security review of our network and systems on a regular basis we use internally developed proprietary software cloudbased software as a service saas as well as purchased software with proven nonproprietary hardware

competition 

the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food price service restaurant location personnel brand attractiveness of facilities availability of carryout and home delivery internet and mobile ordering capabilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing the restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing restaurants and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power we compete within each market with national and regional chains and locallyowned restaurants for guests management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites we also face growing competition from the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées side dishes or meal preparation kits from the deli or prepared foods sections in addition improving product offerings at fast casual restaurants and quickservice restaurants and expansion of home delivery services together with negative economic conditions could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives we expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas 

other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled “purchasing and distribution” “advertising and marketing” and “information technology and cybersecurity” in this item 1 and in our risk factors in item 1a of this form 10k

our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally typically our average sales per restaurant are highest in the winter and spring followed by the summer and lowest in the fall holidays changes in the economy severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions because of the seasonality of our business results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

government regulation 

we are subject to various federal state local and international laws affecting our business each of our restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities which include health safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located the development and operation of restaurants depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites which are subject to zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations to date we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals 

during fiscal 2019  122 percent of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site in most cases on an annual basis and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time these regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant operation including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours of operation advertising wholesale purchasing inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages the failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these licenses would adversely affect the restaurant’s operations we

sustainability 

dardens commitment to sustainability is a key component of providing great service and food to our guests it is an element that separates us from our competitors and a contributor to our business success our approach is both integrated and strategic and spans the enterprise from the food we source to the operation of our restaurants 

we aspire to run the most efficient restaurants in the united states in 2009 we set energy and water conservation goals for our restaurants to reduce the use of each by 15 percent by 2015 when we retired those goals in 2015 we had significantly exceeded both with a 22 percent reduction in water use per restaurant and a 17 percent reduction in energy darden has also established an aspirational goal to send zero waste to landfill over time we have more than doubled our diversion rate over the past ten years to reach our current 32 percent diversion rate from landfills we have accomplished this by first minimizing food loss standardizing our food donation program across all of our restaurants and maximizing costeffective recycling options as our portfolio has grown over time we have done so sustainably since 2008 we have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions per restaurant by 19 percent as measured in accordance with the corporate accounting and reporting standard of the greenhouse gas protocol these historical restaurant sustainability metrics exclude cheddar’s scratch kitchen due to our lack of sustainability data about that business prior to our acquisition of cheddar’s scratch kitchen in april 2017 



 

we also focus on sustainability in today’s evolving food culture we shared darden’s food principles in 2016 to outline our commitment to guests in areas of sustainable sourcing nutritional disclosure food safety and animal welfare darden’s food principles connect each of these strategic business efforts in a guestcentered platform including sourcing and ingredient commitments to our guests we have set commitments related to the following food attributes animal welfare chickens raised without medicallyimportant antibiotics cagefree eggs gestation cratefree pork and removal of partiallyhydrogenated oils phos we are on track to meet our food principles commitments and we continue to monitor progress with our suppliers 

building on our food principles in fiscal 2019 darden adopted an animal welfare policy that encourages an outcomesbased approach to continue to ensure high level of care for farm animals in our supply chain this was the result of a yearlong effort that included extensive benchmarking and input from a variety of stakeholders including animal welfare experts industry partners and suppliers our approach which is aligned with darden’s business priorities and practical to leverage with our supply chain partners will help to clearly prioritize areas and promote improved animal welfare outcomes in line with the best available science and production practices 

conservation is a competitive advantage – it continues to lower our operating costs over time insulate our supply chain and help us attract and retain the most qualified employees – all increasing the success of our business

 item 1a risk factors 

various risks and uncertainties could affect our business any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations 

we rely heavily on information technology in our operations and insufficient guest or employee facing technology or a failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network free from material failure interruption or security breach could harm our ability to effectively operate our business andor result in the loss of respected relationships with our guests or employees 

we rely heavily on information systems across our operations including for ecommerce marketing programs employee engagement management of our supply chain the pointofsale processing system in our restaurants and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability security and capacity of these systems in addition we must effectively respond to changing guest expectations and new technological developments disruptions failures or other performance issues with guest facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our business and negatively affect our relationship with our guests the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems a material network breach in the security of these systems as a result of a cyber attack or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to our company our employees or our guests this could include the theft of our intellectual property trade secrets or sensitive financial information or the improper use of personal information or other “identity theft” of either guest or employee information some of these essential business processes that are dependent on technology are outsourced to third parties while we make efforts to ensure that our providers are observing proper standards and controls we cannot guarantee that breaches or failures caused by these outsourced providers will not occur 

any such failures disruptions or data privacy breaches may cause delays in guest service reduce efficiency in our operations require significant capital investments to remediate the problem result in customer employee or advertiser dissatisfaction or otherwise result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation we could also be subjected to litigation regulatory investigations or the imposition of penalties as privacy and information security laws and regulations change and cyber risks evolve we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance and protect guest employee and company information 

a failure to maintain food safety throughout the supply chain and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

food safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe quality food products even with strong preventative interventions and controls food safety issues could be caused at the source or by food suppliers or distributors and as a result be out of our control and require prompt action to mitigate impact in addition regardless of the source or cause any report of foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a norovirus or salmonella and other 

food safety issues including food tampering or contamination at one of our restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our brands and have a negative impact on our sales even instances of foodborne illness food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients resulting in higher costs and lower margins 

the inability to hire train reward and retain restaurant team members or an inability to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction may impact our ability to achieve our operating growth and financial objectives 

our future growth depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain highquality team members to work in and manage our restaurants adequate staffing of qualified restaurant team members is a critical factor impacting our guests’ experience in our restaurants maintaining adequate staffing in our existing restaurants and hiring and training staff for our new restaurants requires precise workforce planning the low level of unemployment in the united states is resulting in aggressive competition for talent wage inflation and pressure to improve benefits and workplace conditions to remain competitive a shortage of quality candidates who meet all legal citizenship or work authorization requirements failure to recruit and retain new team members in a timely manner or higher than expected turnover levels all could affect our ability to open new restaurants grow sales at existing restaurants or meet our labor cost objectives an inability to adequately monitor and proactively respond to team member dissatisfaction could lead to poor guest satisfaction higher turnover litigation and unionization which could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

a failure to recruit develop and retain effective leaders or the loss or shortage of personnel with key capacities and skills could impact our strategic direction and jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets 

our future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other leadership team members we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management team members in order to achieve our current business objectives and support our projected growth changes in senior management could expose us to significant changes in strategic direction and initiatives a failure to maintain appropriate organizational capacity and capability to support leadership excellence adequate resources innovative skill sets and expectations and build adequate bench strength required for growth or a loss of key skill sets could jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets 

we are subject to a number of risks relating to public policy changes and federal state and local regulation of our business including in the areas of health care reform environmental matters minimum wage unionization data privacy menu labeling immigration requirements and taxes and an insufficient or ineffective response to legislation or government regulation may impact our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability 

the restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal state local and international laws and regulations the development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites which are subject to building zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations and requirements we are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health sanitation safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food including regulations regarding product safety nutritional content and menu labeling we are subject to federal state and local laws governing employment practices and working conditions these laws cover minimum wage rates wage and hour practices labor relations paid and family leave workplace safety and immigration among others the myriad of laws and regulations being passed at the state and local level creates unique challenges for a multistate employer as different standards apply to different locations sometimes with conflicting requirements we must continue to monitor and adapt our employment practices to comply with these various laws and regulations 

we also are subject to federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities such as the ada compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation new or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our labor costs 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge emission and disposal of hazardous materials there also has been increasing focus by united states and overseas governmental authorities on other environmental matters such as climate change the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption this increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating a yet to be specified array of environmental matters legislative regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials taxes transportation and utilities which could decrease our operating profits and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment 

we are subject to laws relating to information security privacy cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud an increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information including social security numbers financial information including credit card numbers and health information compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and any failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws or any breach of our systems could harm our reputation or lead to litigation which could adversely affect our financial condition 

the impact of current laws and regulations the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues could negatively impact our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal state and local authorities could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings 

litigation including allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees guests suppliers business partners shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation these actions and proceedings may involve allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices including wage and hour violations and employment discrimination guest discrimination food safety issues including poor food quality foodborne illness food tampering food contamination and adverse health effects from consumption of various food products or highcalorie foods including obesity other personal injury violation of “dram shop” laws providing an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or a third party trademark infringement violation of the federal securities laws or other concerns the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time the cost to defend litigation may be significant there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease guest acceptance of our brands regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are found liable litigation could impact our operations in other ways as well allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices for example could adversely affect employee acquisition and retention as a result litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable publicity or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could harm our reputation and adversely impact our guest counts and sales 

the good reputation of our restaurant brands is a key factor in the success of our business actual or alleged incidents at any of our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could harm our brands even incidents occurring at restaurants operated by our competitors or in the supply chain generally could result in negative publicity that could harm the restaurant industry overall and indirectly our own brands negative publicity may result from allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices employee dissatisfaction guest discrimination illness injury or any of the other matters discussed above that could give rise to litigation regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants or to only a single restaurant could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand negative publicity also may result from health concerns including food safety and flu outbreaks publication of government or industry findings concerning food products environmental disasters crime incidents data privacy breaches scandals involving our employees or operational problems at our restaurants all of which could make our brands and menu offerings less appealing to our guests and negatively impact our guest counts and sales adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of our brands or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business 

there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate each of which may harm our performance prospects or business the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction the dissemination of information online could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations regardless of the information’s accuracy 

  

many of our competitors are expanding their use of social media and new social media platforms are rapidly being developed potentially making more traditional social media platforms obsolete as a result we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies in order to maintain broad appeal with guests and brand relevance as part of our marketing efforts we rely on social media platforms and search engine marketing to attract and retain guests we also continue to invest in other digital marketing initiatives that allow us to reach our guests across multiple digital channels and build their awareness of engagement with and loyalty to our brands these initiatives may not be successful resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues increased employee engagement or brand recognition in addition a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media including the improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about us exposure of personally identifiable information fraud or outofdate information the inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation 

a majority of our restaurants are operated in leased properties and we are committed to longterm and noncancelable leases that we may want to cancel and may be unable to renew the leases that we may want to extend at the end of their terms 

as of may 26 2019  1715 of our 1785 restaurants operating in the united states and canada operate in leased locations if we close a restaurant in a leased location we may remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease which would include among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term additionally the potential losses associated with our inability to cancel leases may result in our keeping open restaurant locations that are performing significantly below targeted levels as a result ongoing lease obligations at closed or underperforming restaurant locations could impair our results of operations in addition at the end of the lease term and expiration of all renewal periods we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost if at all as a result we may be required to close or relocate a restaurant which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks and may have an adverse effect on our operating performance 

we may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs 

our restaurant operations are subject to united states and canadian federal state and local laws governing such matters as minimum wages working conditions overtime and tip credits as federal state and local minimum wage rates increase we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage labor shortages increased employee turnover and health care and other benefit mandates could also increase our labor costs this in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales conversely if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices our profitability may decline in addition the current premiums that we pay for our insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property health and directors’ and officers’ liability may increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs the dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers’ compensation and general liability insurance for which we carry high perclaim deductibles may also increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs further the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses 

our inability or failure to execute on a comprehensive business continuity plan following a major natural disaster such as a hurricane or manmade disaster including terrorism at our corporate facility could have a materially adverse impact on our business 

many of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one florida location   we have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature including hurricanes and other natural disasters and back up and offsite locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information however if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans we may experience delays in recovery of data inability to perform vital corporate functions tardiness in required reporting and compliance failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims 

health concerns arising from foodrelated pandemics outbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

the united states and other countries have experienced or may experience in the future outbreaks of viruses such as norovirus avian flu or “sars” h1n1 or “swine flu” or other diseases to the extent that a virus or disease is foodborne or perceived to be foodborne future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product or could reduce public confidence in food handling andor public assembly for example public concern over avian flu may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry the inability to serve poultrybased products would restrict our ability to provide a variety of menu items to our guests if we change a restaurant menu in response to such concerns we may lose guests who do not prefer the new menu and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new guest base to produce the sales needed to make the restaurant profitable we also may have different or additional competitors for our intended guests as a result of such a change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors if a virus is transmitted by human contact our employees or guests could become infected or could choose or be advised to avoid gathering in public places any of which could adversely affect our restaurant guest traffic and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level we also could be adversely affected if the world health organization andor the centers for disease control were to restrict travel to affected geographic areas where we source our products thus possibly impacting the continuity of supply additionally jurisdictions in which we have restaurants may impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition and if we have an insufficient focus on competition and the consumer landscape our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

the fullservice dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing service location personnel takeout and delivery options and type and quality of food and there are many wellestablished competitors we compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locallyowned restaurants we also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services particularly in the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées side dishes or meal preparation kits from the deli or prepared foods sections we compete primarily on the quality variety and value perception of menu items the number and location of restaurants type of brand quality and efficiency of service attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors we anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors if we are unable to continue to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

we are subject to changes in consumer preferences that may adversely affect demand for food at our restaurants 

consumers have continually changing health and dietary preferences as a result our diverse portfolio of restaurant brands are continually challenged to evolve our menu offerings to appeal to these changing customer preferences while maintaining our brand character and retaining popular menu items new information or changes in dietary nutritional allergen or health guidelines or environmental or sustainability concerns whether issued by government agencies academic studies advocacy organizations or similar groups may cause some groups of consumers to select foods other than those that are offered by our restaurants if we fail to anticipate changing trends or other consumer preferences our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our failure to drive both shortterm and longterm profitable sales growth through brand relevance operating excellence opening new restaurants of existing brands and acquiring new dining brands could result in poor financial performance 

as part of our business strategy we intend to drive profitable sales growth by increasing samerestaurant sales at existing restaurants continuing to expand our current portfolio of restaurant brands and acquiring additional brands that can be expanded profitably this strategy involves numerous risks and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives 

at existing brands we may not be able to maintain brand relevance and restaurant operating excellence to achieve sustainable samerestaurant sales growth and warrant new unit growth existing brand shortterm sales growth could be impacted if we are unable to drive near term guest count and sales growth and longterm sales growth could be impacted if we fail to extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to our guests a failure to innovate and extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to guests and occasions in order to generate sustainable samerestaurant traffic growth and produce nontraditional sales and earnings growth opportunities insufficient focus on our competition or failure to adequately address declines in the casual dining industry could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition we may not be able to support sustained new unit growth or open all of our planned new restaurants and the new restaurants that we open may not be profitable 

or as profitable as our existing restaurants new restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize and even sales at successful newlyopened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation the opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on guest counts and sales levels at existing restaurants 

the ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations the need to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses on a timely basis the need to comply with other regulatory requirements the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay construction increases in labor and building material costs the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms changes in weather or other acts of god that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions at each potential location we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites construction contractors management personnel hourly employees and other resources if we are unable to successfully manage these risks we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated sales and earnings in future periods 

we also may not be able to identify and successfully acquire and integrate additional brands that are as profitable as our existing restaurants or that provide potential for further growth 

a lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

the success of our restaurants depends in large part on their locations as demographic and economic patterns change current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations in addition desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation the occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may experience higherthananticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants we incur substantial preopening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close relocate or remodel existing restaurants the expenses of opening closing relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated an increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

a failure to identify and execute innovative marketing and guest relationship tactics ineffective or improper use of other marketing initiatives and increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

if our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions if our advertising media or marketing expenses increase if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors or if we do not adequately leverage technology and data analytic capabilities needed to generate concise competitive insight we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations a failure to sufficiently innovate develop guest relationship initiatives or maintain adequate and effective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales 

as part of our marketing efforts we rely on social media platforms and search engine marketing to attract and retain guests these initiatives may not be successful and pose a variety of other risks as discussed above under the heading “our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business” 

a failure to address cost pressures including rising costs for commodities labor health care and utilities used by our restaurants and a failure to effectively deliver cost management activities and achieve economies of scale in purchasing could compress our margins and adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food ingredients labor health care utilities and other related costs over which we may have little control operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities including beef pork chicken seafood cheese butter and produce the introduction of or changes to tariffs on imported food products such as produce and seafood 

could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products we cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices menu offerings and menu prices and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results we attempt to leverage our size to achieve economies of scale in purchasing but there can be no assurances that we can always do so effectively we are also subject to the general risks of inflation 

increases in minimum wage health care and other benefit costs may have a material adverse effect on our labor costs we operate in many states and localities where the minimum wage is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage increases in minimum wage may also result in increases in the wage rates paid for nonminimum wage positions many states and localities are also passing laws regulating employment practices and working conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our labor costs in those areas 

our restaurants’ operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as electricity and natural gas whether as a result of inflation or otherwise on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply in addition interruptions to the availability of gas electric water or other utilities whether due to aging infrastructure weather conditions fire animal damage trees digging accidents or other reasons largely out of our control may adversely affect our operations our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may lose sales or incur increased costs if our restaurants experience shortages delays or interruptions in the delivery of food and other products from our third party vendors and suppliers 

shortages delays or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants may be caused by inclement weather natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods droughts and earthquakes labor issues or other operational disruptions at our suppliers vendors or other service providers the inability of our vendors or service providers to manage adverse business conditions obtain credit or remain solvent or other conditions beyond our control such shortages delays or interruptions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants we have a limited number of suppliers and distributors for certain of our products and services supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our restaurant operations if we raise prices as a result of increased food costs or shortages it may negatively impact our sales if we temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular items from a restaurant’s menu that restaurant may experience a significant reduction in sales during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our guests changing their dining habits 

adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could adversely affect our restaurant sales 

adverse weather conditions can impact guest traffic at our restaurants cause the temporary underutilization of outdoor patio seating and in more severe cases such as hurricanes tornadoes or other natural disasters cause temporary closures sometimes for prolonged periods which would negatively impact our restaurant sales changes in weather could result in construction delays interruptions to the availability of utilities and shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies which could increase our costs some climatologists predict that the longterm effects of climate change and global warming may result in more severe volatile weather or extended droughts which could increase the frequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we may use to hedge exposures to fluctuations in commodity and broader market prices may cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we use or may use derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our principal ingredient labor and energy costs including but not limited to coffee butter wheat soybean oil pork beef diesel fuel gasoline and natural gas changes in the values of these derivatives may be recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings included in our consolidated financial statements 

certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and other general macroeconomic factors including unemployment energy prices and interest rates that are largely beyond our control may adversely affect consumer behavior and our results of operations 

our business results depend on a number of industryspecific and general economic factors many of which are beyond our control the fullservice dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in international national regional and local economic conditions seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant brands the performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends severe weather including hurricanes traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants 

general economic conditions may also adversely affect our results of operations recessionary economic cycles a protracted economic slowdown a worsening economy increased unemployment increased energy prices rising interest rates a downgrade of the us government’s longterm credit rating imposition of retaliatory tariffs on important us imports and exports or other industrywide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings job losses foreclosures bankruptcies and falling home prices could cause guests to make fewer discretionary purchases and any significant decrease in our guest traffic or average profit per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance in addition if gasoline natural gas electricity and other energy costs increase and credit card home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency of their dining occasions may spend less on each dining occasion or may choose more inexpensive restaurants 

furthermore we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts terrorist attacks efforts to combat terrorism heightened security requirements or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems could have on our operations the economy or consumer confidence generally any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures 

unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our guests could increase our costs reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact consumer spending patterns affect the availability and cost of credit and increase pension plan expenses 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control turmoil in global credit markets could adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future there can be no assurances that we will be able to arrange credit on terms we believe are acceptable or that permit us to finance our business with historical margins a lack of credit could have an adverse impact on certain of our suppliers landlords and other tenants in retail centers in which we are located if these issues occur they could negatively affect our financial results any new disruptions in the financial markets may also adversely affect the us and world economy which could negatively impact consumer spending patterns changes in the capital markets could also have significant effects on our pension plan our pension income or expense is affected by factors including the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for the pension plan for some of our employees the weighted average asset allocation and longterm rate of return of our pension plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the interest cost component of our net periodic pension cost 

we face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees and licensees 

certain of our domestic and all of our international locations other than in canada are operated by franchisees or licensees we believe that we have selected highcaliber operating partners and franchisees with significant experience in restaurant operations and are providing them with training and support however the probability of opening ultimate success and quality of any franchise or licensed restaurant rests principally with the franchisee or licensee if the franchisee or licensee does not successfully open and operate its restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards or guests have negative experiences due to issues with food quality or operational execution our brand values could suffer which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we face a variety of risks associated with doing business with business partners and vendors in foreign markets 

we are making efforts to expand our brands overseas through licensing and franchising relationships there is no assurance that international operations will be profitable or that international growth will continue our international operations are subject to all of the same risks associated with our domestic operations as well as a number of additional risks these include among other things international economic and political conditions foreign currency fluctuations and differing cultures and consumer preferences in addition expansion into international markets could create risks to our brands and reputation 

we also are subject to governmental regulations throughout the world that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors these include antitrust and tax requirements antiboycott regulations importexportcustoms regulations and other international trade regulations the usa patriot act the foreign corrupt practices act and applicable local law failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business 

we regard our olive garden ®  longhorn steakhouse ®  cheddar’s scratch kitchen ®  yard house ®  the capital grille ®  the capital burger ®  seasons 52 ®  bahama breeze ®  eddie v’s prime seafood ®  darden ® and darden restaurants ® service marks and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts copyrights patents trademarks service marks and other common law rights such as trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our restaurants and services from infringement we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the united states and foreign jurisdictions however we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other persons although our policy is to oppose any such infringement further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources 

impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment of goodwill exists factors may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and slower growth rates any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations we compute the amount of impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we are required to record a noncash impairment charge if the testing performed indicates that goodwill has been impaired 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets primarily the longhorn steakhouse ®  cheddar’s scratch kitchen ®  the capital grille ®  yard house ® and eddie v’s prime seafood ® trademarks to determine if they are definite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

as with goodwill we test our indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of these assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in tax laws or treaties and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions our effective income tax rate and other taxes in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws or other legislative changes including the tax cuts and jobs act tax act certain international tax treaties and the outcome of income tax audits although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of a tax audit could have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made in addition our effective income tax rate and our results may be impacted by our ability to realize deferred tax benefits and by any increases or decreases of our valuation allowances applied to our existing deferred tax assets additional tax regulations and interpretations of the tax act are expected to be issued and no assurance can be made that future guidance will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

failure of our internal controls over financial reporting and future changes in accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results affect our reported results of operations or otherwise harm our business and financial results 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for 

external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud our growth and acquisition of other restaurant companies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud a significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation 

a change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future changes to existing accounting rules or the application of current accounting practices may adversely affect our reported financial results additionally our assumptions estimates and judgments related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including but not limited to revenue recognition fair value of investments impairment of longlived assets leases and related economic transactions derivatives pension and postretirement benefits intangibles selfinsurance income taxes property and equipment unclaimed property laws and litigation and stockbased compensation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by us changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend this discussion and analysis below for darden restaurants inc darden the company we us or our should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related financial statement notes included in part ii of this report under the caption “item 8  financial statements and supplementary data” we operate on a 5253week fiscal year which ends on the last sunday in may fiscal 2019  which ended may 26 2019  consisted of 52 weeks and fiscal 2018  which ended may 27 2018  consisted of 52 weeks 

overview of operations 

our business operates in the fullservice dining segment of the restaurant industry at may 26 2019  we operated 1785 restaurants through subsidiaries in the united states and canada under the olive garden ®  longhorn steakhouse ®  cheddar’s scratch kitchen ®  yard house ®  the capital grille ®  seasons 52 ®  bahama breeze ® and eddie v’s prime seafood ® trademarks we own and operate all of our restaurants in the united states and canada except for 3 joint venture restaurants managed by us and 37 franchised restaurants we also have 33 franchised restaurants in operation located in latin america and the middle east all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

we believe that capable operators of strong multiunit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the restaurant industry’s fullservice segment generally the restaurant industry is considered to be comprised of three segments quick service fast casual and full service all of our restaurants fall within the fullservice segment which is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains we believe we have strong brands and that the breadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the fullservice segment of the restaurant industry this collective capability is the product of investments over many years in areas that are critical to success in our business including restaurant operations excellence brand management excellence supply chain talent management and information technology among other things 

with a focus on growing samerestaurant sales we’ve implemented a “backtobasics” approach rooted in strong operating fundamentals we’re focused on improving culinary innovation and execution inside each of our brands delivering attentive service to each and every one of our guests and creating an inviting and engaging atmosphere inside our restaurants we support these priorities with smart and relevant integrated marketing programs that resonate with our guests by delivering on these operational and brandbuilding imperatives we expect to increase our market share through new restaurant and samerestaurant sales growth and deliver bestinclass profitability 

the darden support structure enables our brands to achieve their ultimate potential through 1 driving advantages in supply chain and general and administrative support 2 applying insights collected from our significant guest and transactional databases to enhance guest relationships and identify new opportunities to drive sales growth 3 relentlessly driving operating efficiencies and continuous improvement operating with a sense of urgency and inspiring a performancedriven culture and 4 our commitment to rigorous strategic planning 

we seek to increase profits by leveraging our fixed and semifixed costs with sales from new restaurants and increased guest traffic and sales at existing restaurants to evaluate our operations and assess our financial performance we monitor a number of operating measures with a special focus on two key factors 

  

 increasing samerestaurant sales can improve segment profit because these incremental sales provide better leverage of our fixed and semifixed restaurantlevel costs a restaurant brand can generate samerestaurant sales increases through increases in guest traffic increases in the average guest check or a combination of the two the average guest check can be impacted by menu price changes and by the mix of menu items sold for each restaurant brand we gather daily sales data and regularly analyze the guest traffic counts and the mix of menu items sold to aid in developing menu pricing product offerings and promotional strategies we focus on balancing our pricing and product offerings with other initiatives to produce sustainable samerestaurant sales growth we compute samerestaurant sales using restaurants open at least 16 months because this period is generally required for new restaurant sales levels to normalize sales at newly opened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation due to operating or integration inefficiencies our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of new restaurant openings and closings and relocations and remodeling of existing restaurants preopening expenses each period reflect the costs associated with opening new restaurants in current and future periods 

fiscal 2019 financial highlights 

our sales from continuing operations were 851 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to 808 billion in fiscal 2018  the 53 percent increase in sales from continuing operations was primarily driven by revenue from the addition of 39 net new companyowned restaurants and a combined darden samerestaurant sales increase of 25 percent  

net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2019 were 7186 million  573 per diluted share compared with net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 of 6038 million  479 per diluted share net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2019 increased 190 percent and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 196 percent compared with fiscal 2018  

our net loss from discontinued operations was 52 million  004 per diluted share for fiscal 2019  compared with a net loss from discontinued operations of 78 million  006 per diluted share for fiscal 2018  when combined with results from continuing operations our diluted net earnings per share were 569 and 473 for fiscal 2019 and 2018  respectively 

outlook 

we expect fiscal 2020 sales from continuing operations to increase between 53 percent and 63 percent driven by the impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2020  combined darden samerestaurant sales growth of 10 percent to 20 percent and approximately 50 new restaurants in fiscal 2020  we expect our annual effective tax rate to be between 100 percent and 110 percent and we expect capital expenditures incurred to build new restaurants remodel and maintain existing restaurants and technology initiatives to be between 4500 million and 5000 million 

in june 2019  we announced a quarterly dividend of 088 per share payable on august 1 2019  based on the 088 quarterly dividend declaration our expected annual dividend is 352 per share which reflects an increase of 173 percent compared to our fiscal 2019 annual dividend dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors and accordingly the timing and amount of our dividends are subject to change

 interest expense 

net interest expense decreased as a percent of sales in fiscal 2019 primarily due to debt retirement costs of 1022 million incurred in fiscal 2018 associated with the retirement of 3109 million aggregate principal amount of longterm debt 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2019 and 2018 for continuing operations were 81 percent and 03 percent  respectively the increase in the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the favorable impact in fiscal 2018 of the tax cuts and jobs act tax act which included a 793 million onetime adjustment of our net deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding income tax benefit reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings the impact of the deferred tax adjustment was partially offset by a benefit in fiscal 2019 due to the lower federal corporate tax rate of 210 percent compared with the 294 percent blended federal corporate tax rate in effect for fiscal 2018 

net earnings and net earnings per share from continuing operations 

net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2019 were 7186 million  573 per diluted share compared with net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 of 6038 million  479 per diluted share 

net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2019 increased 190 percent and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 196 percent compared with fiscal 2018  our diluted per share results from continuing operations were positively impacted by the tax act by approximately 052 in fiscal 2019 due to the lower federal corporate tax rate of 210 percent as compared with the 294 percent blended federal corporate tax rate in effect for fiscal 2018 our diluted per share results from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 were positively impacted by the tax act by approximately 062 due to a net benefit from deferred tax revaluation our diluted per share results from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 were adversely impacted by approximately 054 related to debt retirement costs and approximately 010 related to costs associated with the integration of cheddar’s scratch kitchen 

loss from discontinued operations 

on an aftertax basis results from discontinued operations for fiscal 2019 were a net loss of 52 million  004 per diluted share compared with a net loss for fiscal 2018 of 78 million  006 per diluted share 

segment results 

we manage our restaurant brands olive garden longhorn steakhouse cheddar’s scratch kitchen yard house the capital grille seasons 52 bahama breeze and eddie v’s in the us and canada as operating segments we aggregate our operating segments into reportable segments based on a combination of the size economic characteristics and subsegment of fullservice dining within which each brand operates our four reportable segments are 1 olive garden 2 longhorn steakhouse 3 fine dining and 4 other business see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report for further details 

our management uses segment profit as the measure for assessing performance of our segments the following table presents segment profit margin for the periods indicated 



the increase in the olive garden longhorn steakhouse and fine dining segment profit margins for fiscal 2019 was driven primarily by leveraging positive samerestaurant sales the decrease in other business’ segment profit margin for fiscal 2019 was driven primarily by margin impact from negative samerestaurant sales and workforce investments other business’ segment profit margin was also negatively impacted by the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance which requires franchisee purchases of our inventory through our distribution network to be recognized as revenue with a corresponding increase to food and beverage expense 

results of operations for fiscal 2018 compared to 2017 

for a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended may 27 2018 and may 28 2017  see “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended may 27 2018  filed with the sec on july 20 2018 

seasonality 

our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally typically our average sales per restaurant are highest in the winter and spring followed by the summer and lowest in the fall holidays changes in the economy severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions because of the seasonality of our business results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

impact of inflation 

we attempt to minimize the annual effects of inflation through appropriate planning operating practices and menu price increases we do not believe inflation had a significant overall effect on our annual results of operations during fiscal 2019 or 2018  

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions we consider the following estimates to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

leases 

we evaluate our leases at their inception to estimate their expected term which commences on the date when we have the right to control the use of the leased property and includes the noncancelable base term plus all option periods we are reasonably assured to exercise our judgment in determining the appropriate expected term for each lease affects our evaluation of 

 these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different expected lease terms were used 

valuation of longlived assets 

land buildings and equipment and certain other assets including definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the judgments we make related to the expected useful lives of longlived assets definitions of lease terms and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of these assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets changes in economic conditions changes in usage or operating performance desirability of the restaurant sites and other factors such as our ability to sell our assets held for sale as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our longlived assets significant adverse changes in these factors could cause us to realize an impairment loss based on a review of operating results for each of our restaurants the amount of net book value associated with lower performing restaurants that would be deemed at risk for impairment is not material to our consolidated financial statements 

valuation and recoverability of goodwill and trademarks 

goodwill and trademarks are not subject to amortization and have been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing the reporting units are our restaurant brands a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and slower growth rates any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements we review our goodwill and trademarks for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist each reporting unit’s fair value is compared to its carrying value 

we estimate fair value of each reporting unit using the best information available including market information also referred to as the market approach and discounted cash flow projections also referred to as the income approach a market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow and sales multiples to the reporting unit’s operating performance the 

multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units the income approach uses a reporting unit’s projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects current market conditions we recognize an impairment loss when the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

we estimate the fair value of trademarks using the relieffromroyalty method which requires assumptions related to projected sales from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademarks and a discount rate we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value 

we performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill and trademarks as of the first day of our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter as of the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter we had eight reporting units six of which had goodwill and seven of which had trademarks as a result of the impairment tests no indicators of impairment were identified and no additional indicators of impairment were identified through the end of our fourth fiscal quarter that would require us to test further for impairment however changes in circumstances existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future such as declines in our market capitalization reflected in our stock price as well as in the market capitalization of other companies in the restaurant industry declines in sales at our restaurants and significant adverse changes in the operating environment for the restaurant industry could result in an impairment loss of all or a portion of our goodwill or trademarks the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by at least 40 percent and the fair value of each reporting unit’s trademark exceeded its carrying value by at least 20 percent 

if our annual test resulted in an impairment of our goodwill or trademarks our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected and our leverage ratio for purposes of our credit agreement would increase a leverage ratio exceeding the maximum permitted under our credit agreement would be a default under our credit agreement at may 26 2019  a writedown of goodwill other indefinitelived intangible assets or any other assets in excess of approximately 128 billion would have been required to cause our leverage ratio to exceed the permitted maximum as our leverage ratio is determined on a quarterly basis and due to the seasonal nature of our business a lesser amount of impairment in future quarters could cause our leverage ratio to exceed the permitted maximum 

unearned revenues 

unearned revenues primarily represent our liability for gift cards that have been sold but not yet redeemed the estimated value of gift cards expected to remain unused is recognized over the expected period of redemption as the remaining gift card values are redeemed generally over a period of 12 years utilizing this method we estimate both the amount of breakage and the time period of redemption if actual redemption patterns vary from our estimates actual gift card breakage income may differ from the amounts recorded we update our estimates of our redemption period and our breakage rate periodically and apply that rate to gift card redemptions on a prospective basis changing our breakagerate estimates by 50 basis points would have resulted in an adjustment in our breakage income of approximately 36 million for fiscal 2019 

income taxes 

we estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes these estimates include among other items depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported employee tip income effective rates for state and local income taxes and the tax deductibility of certain other items we adjust our annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available 

assessment of uncertain tax positions requires judgments relating to the amounts timing and likelihood of resolution as described in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report the 270 million balance of unrecognized tax benefits at may 26 2019  includes 116 million related to tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts could change during the next 12 months based on the outcome of examinations the 116 million relates to items that would impact our effective income tax rate 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows generated from operating activities are our principal source of liquidity which we use to finance capital expenditures for new restaurants and to remodel and maintain existing restaurants to pay dividends to our shareholders and to repurchase shares of our common stock since substantially all of our sales are for cash and cash equivalents and accounts 

payable are generally paid in 5 to 60 days we are able to carry current liabilities in excess of current assets in addition to cash flows from operations we use a combination of longterm and shortterm borrowings to fund our capital needs 

we currently manage our business and financial ratios to target an investmentgrade bond rating which has historically allowed flexible access to financing at reasonable costs our publicly issued longterm debt currently carries the following ratings 

 our commercial paper has ratings of 

 

these ratings are as of the date of the filing of this report and have been obtained with the understanding that moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch will continue to monitor our credit and make future adjustments to these ratings to the extent warranted the ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our securities may be changed superseded or withdrawn at any time and should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

we maintain a 7500 million revolving credit agreement revolving credit agreement with bank of america na boa as administrative agent and the lenders and other agents party thereto the revolving credit agreement is a senior unsecured credit commitment to the company and contains customary representations and affirmative and negative covenants including limitations on liens and subsidiary debt and a maximum consolidated lease adjusted total debt to total capitalization ratio of 075 to 100 and events of default usual for credit facilities of this type as of may 26 2019  we were in compliance with all covenants under the revolving credit agreement 

the revolving credit agreement matures on october 27 2022  and the proceeds may be used for working capital and capital expenditures the refinancing of certain indebtedness certain acquisitions and general corporate purposes loans under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at a rate of libor plus a margin determined by reference to a ratingsbased pricing grid applicable margin or the base rate which is defined as the highest of the boa prime rate the federal funds rate plus 0500 percent  and the eurocurrency rate plus 100 percent plus the applicable margin assuming a “bbb” equivalent credit rating level the applicable margin under the revolving credit agreement will be 1000 percent for libor loans and 0000 percent for base rate loans as of may 26 2019  we had no outstanding balances under the revolving credit agreement 

at may 26 2019  our longterm debt consisted principally of 

 the interest rate on our 428 million 6800 percent senior notes due october 2037 is subject to adjustment from time to time if the debt rating assigned to such series of notes is downgraded below a certain rating level or subsequently upgraded the maximum adjustment is 2000 percent above the initial interest rate and the interest rate cannot be reduced below the initial interest rate as of may 26 2019  no such adjustments are made to this rate 

through our shelf registration statement on file with the sec depending on conditions prevailing in the public capital markets we may issue unsecured debt securities from time to time in one or more series which may consist of notes debentures or other evidences of indebtedness in one or more offerings 

from time to time we may repurchase our outstanding debt in privately negotiated transactions such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements and other factors 

from time to time we enter into interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk inherent in our operations see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report 

a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at may 26 2019  is as follows 



 

our adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio which includes 600 times the combined total annual minimum rent for operating leases and annual minimum lease payments for financing leases on a consolidated basis of  3595 million and 3427 million for the fiscal years ended may 26 2019 and may 27 2018  respectively as components of adjusted debt and adjusted total capital was 58 percent and 60 percent as of may 26 2019 and may 27 2018  respectively we include the leasedebt equivalent and contractual lease guarantees in our adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio reported to shareholders as we believe its inclusion better represents the optimal capital structure that we target from period to period and because it is consistent with the calculation of the covenant under our revolving credit agreement 

based on these ratios we believe our financial condition is strong the composition of our capital structure is shown in the following table 



net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations were 127 billion and 102 billion in fiscal 2019 and 2018  respectively net cash flows provided by operating activities include net earnings from continuing operations of 7186 million and 6038 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018  respectively net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased in fiscal 2019 primarily due to higher net earnings from continuing operations 

net cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations were 4626 million in fiscal 2019 compared to net cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations of 4511 million in fiscal 2018  capital expenditures incurred principally for building new restaurants remodeling existing restaurants replacing equipment and technology initiatives were 4520 million in fiscal 2019  compared to 3960 million in fiscal 2018  for fiscal 2018  net cash used in the acquisition of 11 cheddar’s scratch kitchen restaurants from an existing franchisee was 404 million  

net cash flows used in financing activities from continuing operations were 4842 million in fiscal 2019  compared to 6366 million in fiscal 2018  net cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2019 included dividend payments of 3708 million and share repurchases of 2075 million  partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from financing lease obligations net cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2018 reflected longterm debt payments of 4082 million  including repurchase premiums and makewhole provisions repayments of shortterm debt of 9600 million  dividend payments of 3135 million and share repurchases of 2348 million  partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of shortterm debt of 9600 million  proceeds from the issuance of 3000 million of senior notes and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 

our defined benefit and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are determined using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies prescribed under financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic 715 compensation  retirement benefits and topic 712 compensation  nonretirement postemployment benefits we use certain assumptions including but not limited to the selection of a discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we set the discount rate assumption annually for each plan at its valuation date to reflect the yield of highquality fixedincome debt 

instruments with lives that approximate the maturity of the plan benefits at may 26 2019  our discount rate was 266 percent and 395 percent  respectively for our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based upon several factors including our historical assumptions compared with actual results an analysis of current market conditions asset allocations and the views of leading financial advisers and economists our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for our defined benefit plans was 425 percent for fiscal year 2019 and 575 percent for fiscal year 2018  we expect to contribute approximately 04 million to our defined benefit pension plans and approximately 14 million to our postretirement benefit plan during fiscal 2020  in april 2018 our benefit plans committee approved the termination of our primary noncontributory defined benefit pension plan the retirement income plan for darden restaurants inc the termination of the plan involves many steps including filing information with the irs and the pension benefit guaranty corporation and obtaining proper approvals we anticipate the termination process which culminates in either the settlement or transfer of participant benefits will be completed in fiscal 2020 the plan termination is expected to result in noncash pretax pension settlement expense in fiscal 2020 of approximately 1300 million  

we have recognized net losses of 1004 million net of tax and of 49 million net of tax as components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the defined benefit plans and postretirement benefit plan respectively as of may 26 2019  these net losses represent changes in the amount of the projected benefit obligation and plan assets resulting from differences in the assumptions used and actual experience 

we believe our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the factors discussed above however other assumptions could also be reasonably applied that could differ from the assumptions used these changes in assumptions would not significantly impact our funding requirements 

we are not aware of any trends or events that would materially affect our capital requirements or liquidity we believe that our internal cashgenerating capabilities the potential issuance of unsecured debt securities under our shelf registration statement and shortterm commercial paper should be sufficient to finance our capital expenditures debt maturities dividend payments stock repurchase program and other operating activities through fiscal 2020  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are not a party to any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition sales or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

financial condition 

our total current assets were 8926 million at may 26 2019  compared with 5536 million at may 27 2018  the increase was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents driven by cash from operations 

our total current liabilities were 147 billion at may 26 2019  compared with 138 billion at may 27 2018  the increase was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable 

application of new accounting standards 

see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates compensation and commodity prices to manage this exposure we periodically enter into interest rate and foreign currency exchange instruments equity forward and commodity derivative instruments for other than trading purposes see notes 1 and 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report 

we use the variancecovariance method to measure value at risk over time horizons ranging from one week to one year at the 95 percent confidence level at may 26 2019  our potential losses in future net earnings resulting from changes in equity forwards commodity instruments and floating rate debt interest rate exposures were approximately 422 million over a period of one year the value at risk from an increase in the fair value of all of our longterm fixedrate debt over a period of one year was approximately 933 million the fair value of our longterm fixedrate debt outstanding as of may 26 2019  averaged 9178 

million with a high of 9557 million and a low of 8879 million during fiscal 2019  our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows by targeting an appropriate mix of variable and fixedrate debt

strategy 

we believe that capable operators of strong multiunit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the restaurant industry’s fullservice segment generally the restaurant industry is considered to be comprised of three segments quick service fast casual and full service all of our restaurants fall within the fullservice segment which is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains we believe we have strong brands and that the breadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the fullservice restaurant industry this collective capability is the product of investments over many years in areas that are critical to success in our business including restaurant operations excellence brand management excellence supply chain talent management and information technology among other things 

during fiscal 2018 our operating philosophy remained focused on improving the core operational fundamentals of the business by providing an outstanding guest experience rooted in culinary innovation attentive service engaging atmosphere and integrated marketing darden enables each brand to reach its full potential by leveraging its scale insight and experience in a way that protects uniqueness and competitive advantages additionally brands can capitalize on insights to deliver customized onetoone customer relationship marketing we hold ourselves accountable for operating our restaurants with a sense of urgency to achieve our commitments to all of our stakeholders 

recent and planned restaurant growth 

during fiscal 2018  we added 51  net new companyowned restaurants in the united states including the cheddar’s scratch kitchen franchised restaurants acquired in august 2017 our fiscal 2018  actual restaurant openings and closings fiscal 2019  projected openings and approximate capital investment square footage and dining capacity by brand are shown below 



 

the actual number of openings for each of our brands for fiscal 2019  will depend on many factors including our ability to locate appropriate sites negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms obtain necessary local governmental permits complete construction and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel our objective is to continue to expand all of our restaurant brands 

we consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant’s longterm success and we devote significant effort to the site selection process prior to entering a market we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors these factors include trade area demographics such as target population density and household income levels competitive influences in the trade area the site’s visibility accessibility and traffic volume and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls hotelmotel complexes offices and universities members of senior management evaluate inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after permits are obtained and the site is acquired 

we systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards when a restaurant falls below minimum standards we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes and implement marketing and operational plans to improve that restaurant’s performance if performance does not improve to acceptable levels the restaurant is evaluated for relocation closing or conversion to one of our other brands permanent closures are typically due to economic changes in trade areas the expiration of lease agreements or site concerns accordingly we continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges 

restaurant operations 

we believe that highquality restaurant management is critical to our longterm success our restaurant management structure varies by brand and restaurant size we issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations 

as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards 

each olive garden restaurant is led by a general manager and each longhorn steakhouse restaurant is led by a managing partner each also has three to five additional managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant in addition each restaurant typically employs an average of 80 to 120 hourly team members most of whom work parttime restaurant general managers or managing partners report to a director of operations who is responsible for approximately seven to ten restaurants each director of operations of olive garden and longhorn steakhouse reports to a senior vice president of operations who is responsible for up to one hundred restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by operations management including officer level executives to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards

we maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our managementlevel team members we believe that our leadership position strong resultsoriented culture and various shortterm and longterm incentive programs including stockbased compensation enhances our ability to attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers 

quality assurance 

our total quality department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe highquality food in a clean and safe environment through rigorous supplier and riskbased product evaluations we purchase only products that meet or exceed our product specifications we rely on independent third parties to inspect and evaluate our suppliers and distributors suppliers that produce “highrisk” products are subject to a food safety evaluation by darden personnel at least annually we require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive hazard analysis and critical control point haccp food safety programs and riskbased preventative controls adopted by the us food and drug administration these programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause foodborne illnesses by applying scientificallybased controls to analyze hazards identify and monitor critical control points and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met we require routine food safety verification for highrisk products from our suppliers our total quality managers and third party auditors visit each restaurant regularly throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation the total quality managers also serve as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety 

purchasing and distribution 

our ability to ensure a consistent supply of safe highquality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant brands depends on reliable sources of procurement our purchasing staff sources negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 1500 suppliers whose products originate in more than 35 countries suppliers must meet our requirements and 

strict quality control standards in the development harvest catch and production of food products competitive bids longterm contracts and strategic supplier relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products 

we believe that our significant scale is a competitive advantage and our purchasing team leverages this purchasing capability our purchasing staff travels routinely within the united states and internationally to source topquality food products at competitive prices we believe that we have established excellent longterm relationships with key suppliers and usually source our product directly from producers not brokers or middlemen we actively support several national minority supplier organizations to ensure that darden incorporates women and minorityowned businesses in all of its purchasing decisions 

we continue to drive automation of our supply chain by working with our suppliers logistics partners and distributors to improve optimization with information visibility through our subsidiary darden direct distribution inc darden direct and longterm agreements with our third party national distribution companies we maintain inventory ownership of food and supplies in warehouses primarily dedicated to darden where practical to do so darden direct further enables our purchasing staff to integrate demand forecasts into longterm agreements driving efficiencies in production economics when we collaborate with suppliers because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales 

advertising and marketing 

integrated marketing is a key element of our strategy and our scale enables us to be a leading advertiser in the fullservice dining segment of the restaurant industry olive garden leverages the efficiency of national network television advertising olive garden supplements this with cable local television and digital advertising longhorn steakhouse uses local television and digital advertising to build engagement and loyalty by market cheddar’s scratch kitchen the capital grille yard house bahama breeze seasons 52 and eddie v’s do not use television advertising but rely on local and digital marketing our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to build awareness and strengthen our brands we implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase our sales and profits as well as increase frequency of visitation by our guests we also rely on outdoor billboard direct mail and email advertising as well as radio newspapers digital coupons search engine marketing and social media such as facebook® and instagram® as appropriate to attract engage and retain our guests we have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor guest satisfaction and evolving food service trends and expectations

as a fullservice restaurant company food is always top of mind but our team members make the difference  they are at the heart of everything we do we believe the guest experience can never exceed the team member experience so we hire the best and retain them by fostering an environment of respect where diversity of thought and background is valued and everyone has the opportunity to develop and grow their careers we offer our team members flexible work schedules competitive wages and benefits 

consistent with one of our core values of diversity we are committed to attracting retaining engaging and developing a workforce that mirrors the diversity of our guests approximately 50 percent of our restaurant team members are minorities and more than 55 percent are female we also achieved a 100 percent score on the human rights campaign’s corporate equality index for our business practices and policies toward our lesbian gay bisexual and transgender team members additionally we

consistent with our core values of respect and caring and teamwork in fiscal 1999 we established a program called darden dimes to help fellow darden team members in need   darden dimes provides shortterm financial grants to team members experiencing financial need caused by unexpected emergencies or catastrophic natural disasters participating team members donate as little as 10 cents from each paycheck to the darden dimes fund which raises and grants more than 15 million annually 

we succeed because of our people and with our success come rewards recognition and great opportunities for our team members we invest in their careers every step of the way by providing the tools they need to succeed in their current roles to grow personally and professionally and to deliver exceptional experiences to our guests each day with thousands of leadership positions across our restaurants we provide a pathway and training for thousands of individuals across the country to advance from entrylevel jobs into management roles in addition our geographic footprint often puts us in a position to offer our restaurant team members jobs in their current roles when personal circumstances require relocation this is one of the reasons darden enjoys the lowest annual turnover rates for hourly team members in the industry 

information technology and cybersecurity 

we strive for leadership in the restaurant business by using technology as a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy we have implemented technologyenabled business solutions to improve financial control cost management guest service and employee effectiveness as well as enable ecommerce these solutions are designed to be used across restaurant brands yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant brand our strategy is to fully integrate systems to drive operational efficiencies and enable restaurant teams to focus on restaurant operations excellence

competition 

the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food price service restaurant location personnel brand attractiveness of facilities availability of carryout and home delivery internet and mobile ordering capabilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing the restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing restaurants and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power we compete within each market with national and regional chains and locallyowned restaurants for guests management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites we also face growing competition from the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and 

side dishes from the deli section in addition improving product offerings at fast casual restaurants and quickservice restaurants and expansion of home delivery services together with negative economic conditions could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives we expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas

 item 1a risk factors 

various risks and uncertainties could affect our business any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations 

we rely heavily on information technology in our operations and insufficient guest or employee facing technology or a failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network free from material failure interruption or security breach could harm our ability to effectively operate our business andor result in the loss of respected relationships with our guests or employees 

we rely heavily on information systems across our operations including for ecommerce marketing programs employee engagement management of our supply chain the pointofsale processing system in our restaurants and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability security and capacity of these systems in addition we must effectively respond to changing guest expectations and new technological developments disruptions failures or other performance issues with guest facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our business and negatively affect our relationship with our guests the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems a material network breach in the security of these systems as a result of a cyber attack or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to our company our employees or our guests this could include the theft of our intellectual property trade secrets or sensitive financial information or the improper use of personal information or other “identity theft” of either guest or employee information some of these essential business processes that are dependent on technology are outsourced to third parties while we make efforts to ensure that our providers are observing proper standards and controls we cannot guarantee that breaches or failures caused by these outsourced providers will not occur 

any such failures disruptions or data privacy breaches may cause delays in guest service reduce efficiency in our operations require significant capital investments to remediate the problem result in customer employee or advertiser dissatisfaction or otherwise result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation we could also be subjected to litigation regulatory investigations or the imposition of penalties as privacy and information security laws and regulations change and cyber risks evolve we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance and protect guest employee and company information 

a failure to maintain food safety throughout the supply chain and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

food safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe quality food products even with strong preventative interventions and controls food safety issues could be caused at the source or by food suppliers or distributors and as a result be out of our control and require prompt action to mitigate impact in addition regardless of the source or cause any report of foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a norovirus or salmonella and other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination at one of our restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our brands and have a negative impact on our sales even instances of foodborne illness food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients resulting in higher costs and lower margins 

the inability to hire train reward and retain restaurant team members or an inability to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction may impact our ability to achieve our operating growth and financial objectives 

our future growth depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain highquality team members to work in and manage our restaurants adequate staffing of qualified restaurant team members is a critical factor impacting our guests’ experience in our restaurants maintaining adequate staffing in our existing restaurants and hiring and training staff for our new restaurants requires precise workforce planning the low level of unemployment in the united states is resulting in aggressive competition for talent wage inflation and pressure to improve benefits and workplace conditions to remain competitive a shortage of quality candidates failure to recruit and retain new team members in a timely manner or higher than expected turnover levels all could affect our ability to open new restaurants grow sales at existing restaurants or meet our labor cost objectives an inability to adequately monitor and proactively respond to team member dissatisfaction could lead to poor guest satisfaction higher turnover litigation and unionization which could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

a failure to recruit develop and retain effective leaders or the loss or shortage of personnel with key capacities and skills could impact our strategic direction and jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

our future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other leadership team members we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management team members in order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth changes in senior management could expose us to significant changes in strategic direction and initiatives a failure to maintain appropriate organizational capacity and capability to support leadership excellence adequate resources innovative skill sets and expectations and build adequate bench strength required for growth or a loss of key skill sets could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

litigation including allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees guests suppliers shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation these actions and proceedings may involve allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices including wage and hour violations and employment discrimination guest discrimination food safety issues including poor food quality foodborne illness food tampering food contamination and adverse health effects from consumption of various food products or highcalorie foods including obesity other personal injury violation of “dram shop” laws providing an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or a third party trademark infringement violation of the federal securities laws or other concerns the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time the cost to defend litigation may be significant there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease guest acceptance of our brands regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are found liable litigation could impact our operations in other ways as well allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices for example could adversely affect employee acquisition and retention as a result litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable publicity or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could harm our reputation and adversely impact our guest counts and sales 

the good reputation of our restaurant brands is a key factor in the success of our business actual or alleged incidents at any of our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could harm our brands even incidents occurring at restaurants operated by our competitors or in the supply chain generally could result in negative publicity that could harm the restaurant industry overall and indirectly our own brands negative publicity may result from allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices employee dissatisfaction guest discrimination illness injury or any of the other matters discussed above that could give rise to litigation regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants or to only a single restaurant could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand negative publicity also may result from health concerns including food safety and flu outbreaks publication of government or industry findings concerning food products environmental disasters crime incidents data privacy breaches scandals involving our employees or operational problems at our restaurants all of which could make our brands and menu offerings less appealing to our guests and negatively impact our guest counts and sales adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of our brands or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business 

  there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate each of which may harm our performance prospects or business the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction the dissemination of information online could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations regardless of the information’s accuracy 

  

many of our competitors are expanding their use of social media and new social media platforms are rapidly being developed potentially making more traditional social media platforms obsolete as a result we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies in order to maintain broad appeal with guests and brand relevance as part of our marketing efforts we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain guests we also continue to invest in other digital marketing initiatives that allow us to reach our guests across multiple digital channels and build their awareness of engagement with and loyalty to our brands these initiatives may not be successful resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues increased employee engagement or brand recognition in addition a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media including the improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about us exposure of personally identifiable information fraud or outofdate information the inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation 

we are subject to a number of risks relating to public policy changes and federal state and local regulation of our business including in the areas of health care reform environmental matters minimum wage unionization data privacy menu labeling immigration requirements and taxes and an insufficient or ineffective response to government regulation may impact our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability 

the restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal state local and international laws and regulations the development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites which are subject to building zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations and requirements we are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health sanitation safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food including regulations regarding product safety nutritional content and menu labeling we are subject to federal state and local laws governing employment practices and working conditions these laws cover wage and hour practices labor relations paid and family leave workplace safety and immigration among others the myriad of laws and regulations being passed at the state and local level creates unique challenges for a multistate employer as different standards apply to different locations sometimes with conflicting requirements we must continue to monitor and adapt our employment practices to comply with these various laws and regulations 

we also are subject to federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities such as the ada compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation new or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our labor costs 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge emission and disposal of hazardous materials there also has been increasing focus by united states and overseas governmental authorities on other environmental matters such as climate change the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption this increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating a yet to be specified array of environmental matters legislative regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials taxes transportation and utilities which could decrease our operating profits and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment 

we are subject to laws relating to information security privacy cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud an increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information including social security numbers financial information including credit card numbers and health information compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and any failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws or any breach of our systems could harm our reputation or lead to litigation which could adversely affect our financial condition 

the impact of current laws and regulations the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues could negatively impact our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal state and local authorities could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings 

a majority of our restaurants are operated in leased properties and we are committed to longterm and noncancelable leases that we may want to cancel and may be unable to renew the leases that we may want to extend at the end of their terms 

as of may 27 2018  1655  of our 1746  restaurants operating in the united states and canada operate in leased locations if we close a restaurant in a leased location we may remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease which would include among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term additionally the potential losses associated with our inability to cancel leases may result in our keeping open restaurant locations that are performing significantly below targeted levels as a result ongoing lease obligations at closed or underperforming restaurant locations could impair our results of operations in addition at the end of the lease term and expiration of all renewal periods we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost if at all as a result we may be required to close or relocate a restaurant which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks and may have an adverse effect on our operating performance 

we may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs 

our restaurant operations are subject to united states and canadian federal state and local laws governing such matters as minimum wages working conditions overtime and tip credits as federal state and local minimum wage rates increase we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage labor shortages increased employee turnover and health care and other benefit mandates could also increase our labor costs this in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales conversely if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices our profitability may decline in addition the current premiums that we pay for our insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property health and directors’ and officers’ liability may increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs the dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers’ compensation and general liability insurance for which we carry high perclaim deductibles may also increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs further the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses 

our inability or failure to execute on a comprehensive business continuity plan following a major natural disaster such as a hurricane or manmade disaster including terrorism at our corporate facility could have a materially adverse impact on our business 

many of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one florida location   we have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature including hurricanes and other natural disasters and back up and offsite locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information however if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans we may experience delays in recovery of data inability to perform vital corporate functions tardiness in required reporting and compliance failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims 

health concerns arising from foodrelated pandemics outbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

the united states and other countries have experienced or may experience in the future outbreaks of viruses such as norovirus avian flu or “sars” h1n1 or “swine flu” or other diseases to the extent that a virus or disease is foodborne or perceived to be foodborne future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product or could reduce public confidence in food handling andor public assembly for example public concern over avian flu may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry the inability to serve poultrybased products would restrict our ability to provide a variety of menu items to our guests if we change a restaurant menu in response to such concerns we may lose guests who do not prefer the new menu and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new guest base to produce the sales needed to make the restaurant profitable we also may have different or additional competitors for our intended guests as a result of such a change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors if a virus is transmitted by human contact our employees or guests could become infected or could choose or be advised to avoid gathering in public places any of which could adversely affect our restaurant guest traffic and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level we also could be 

adversely affected if the world health organization andor the centers for disease control were to restrict travel to affected geographic areas where we source our products thus possibly impacting the continuity of supply additionally jurisdictions in which we have restaurants may impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition and if we have an insufficient focus on competition and the consumer landscape our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

the fullservice dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing service location personnel takeout and delivery options and type and quality of food and there are many wellestablished competitors we compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locallyowned restaurants we also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services particularly in the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section we compete primarily on the quality variety and value perception of menu items the number and location of restaurants type of brand quality and efficiency of service attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors we anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors if we are unable to continue to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our failure to drive both shortterm and longterm profitable sales growth through brand relevance operating excellence opening new restaurants of existing brands and acquiring new dining brands could result in poor financial performance 

as part of our business strategy we intend to drive profitable sales growth by increasing samerestaurant sales at existing restaurants continuing to expand our current portfolio of restaurant brands and acquiring additional brands that can be expanded profitably this strategy involves numerous risks and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives 

at existing brands we may not be able to maintain brand relevance and restaurant operating excellence to achieve sustainable samerestaurant sales growth and warrant new unit growth existing brand shortterm sales growth could be impacted if we are unable to drive near term guest count and sales growth and longterm sales growth could be impacted if we fail to extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to our guests a failure to innovate and extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to guests and occasions in order to generate sustainable samerestaurant traffic growth and produce nontraditional sales and earnings growth opportunities insufficient focus on our competition or failure to adequately address declines in the casual dining industry could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition we may not be able to support sustained new unit growth or open all of our planned new restaurants and the new restaurants that we open may not be profitable or as profitable as our existing restaurants new restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize and even sales at successful newlyopened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation the opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on guest counts and sales levels at existing restaurants 

the ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations the need to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses on a timely basis the need to comply with other regulatory requirements the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay construction increases in labor and building material costs the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms changes in weather or other acts of god that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions at each potential location we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites construction contractors management personnel hourly employees and other resources if we are unable to successfully manage these risks we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated sales and earnings in future periods 

we also may not be able to identify and successfully acquire and integrate additional brands that are as profitable as our existing restaurants or that provide potential for further growth 

a lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

the success of our restaurants depends in large part on their locations as demographic and economic patterns change current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations in addition desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an 

acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation the occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may experience higherthananticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants we incur substantial preopening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close relocate or remodel existing restaurants the expenses of opening closing relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated an increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

a failure to identify and execute innovative marketing and guest relationship tactics ineffective or improper use of other marketing initiatives and increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

if our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions if our advertising media or marketing expenses increase if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors or if we do not adequately leverage technology and data analytic capabilities needed to generate concise competitive insight we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations a failure to sufficiently innovate develop guest relationship initiatives or maintain adequate and effective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales 

as part of our marketing efforts we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain guests these initiatives may not be successful and pose a variety of other risks as discussed above under the heading “our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business” 

a failure to address cost pressures including rising costs for commodities labor health care and utilities used by our restaurants and a failure to effectively deliver cost management activities and achieve economies of scale in purchasing could compress our margins and adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food ingredients labor health care utilities and other related costs over which we may have little control operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities including beef pork chicken seafood cheese butter and produce the introduction of or changes to tariffs on imported food products such as shrimp could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products we cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results we attempt to leverage our size to achieve economies of scale in purchasing but there can be no assurances that we can always do so effectively we are subject to the general risks of inflation 

increases in minimum wage health care and other benefit costs may have a material adverse effect on our labor costs we operate in many states and localities where the minimum wage is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage increases in minimum wage may also result in increases in the wage rates paid for nonminimum wage positions 

our restaurants’ operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as electricity and natural gas whether as a result of inflation or otherwise on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply in addition interruptions to the availability of gas electric water or other utilities whether due to aging infrastructure weather conditions fire animal damage trees digging accidents or other reasons largely out of our control may adversely affect our operations our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may lose sales or incur increased costs if our restaurants experience shortages or interruptions in the delivery of food and other products from our third party vendors and suppliers 

shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants may be caused by inclement weather natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods droughts and earthquakes the inability of our vendors to obtain credit in a tightened credit market or remain solvent given disruptions in the financial markets or other conditions beyond our control such shortages or interruptions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants we may have a limited number of suppliers for certain of our products supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our restaurant operations if we raise prices as a result of increased food costs or shortages it may negatively impact our sales if we temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular 

items from a restaurant’s menu that restaurant may experience a significant reduction in sales during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our guests changing their dining habits 

adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could adversely affect our restaurant sales 

adverse weather conditions can impact guest traffic at our restaurants cause the temporary underutilization of outdoor patio seating and in more severe cases such as hurricanes tornadoes or other natural disasters cause temporary closures sometimes for prolonged periods which would negatively impact our restaurant sales changes in weather could result in construction delays interruptions to the availability of utilities and shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies which could increase our costs some climatologists predict that the longterm effects of climate change and global warming may result in more severe volatile weather or extended droughts which could increase the frequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we may use to hedge exposures to fluctuations in commodity and broader market prices may cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we use or may use derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our principal ingredient labor and energy costs including but not limited to coffee butter wheat soybean oil pork beef diesel fuel gasoline and natural gas changes in the values of these derivatives may be recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings included in our consolidated financial statements 

certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and other general macroeconomic factors including unemployment energy prices and interest rates that are largely beyond our control may adversely affect consumer behavior and our results of operations 

our business results depend on a number of industryspecific and general economic factors many of which are beyond our control the fullservice dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in international national regional and local economic conditions seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant brands the performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends severe weather including hurricanes traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants 

general economic conditions may also adversely affect our results of operations recessionary economic cycles a protracted economic slowdown a worsening economy increased unemployment increased energy prices rising interest rates a downgrade of the us government’s longterm credit rating imposition of retaliatory tariffs on important us imports and exports or other industrywide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings job losses foreclosures bankruptcies and falling home prices could cause guests to make fewer discretionary purchases and any significant decrease in our guest traffic or average profit per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance in addition if gasoline natural gas electricity and other energy costs increase and credit card home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine out may spend less on each dining out occasion or may choose more inexpensive restaurants 

furthermore we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts terrorist attacks efforts to combat terrorism heightened security requirements or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems could have on our operations the economy or consumer confidence generally any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures 

unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our guests could increase our costs reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact consumer spending patterns affect the availability and cost of credit and increase pension plan expenses 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control turmoil in global credit markets could adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future there can be no assurances that we will be able to arrange credit on terms we believe are acceptable or that permit us to finance our business with 

historical margins a lack of credit could have an adverse impact on certain of our suppliers landlords and other tenants in retail centers in which we are located if these issues occur they could negatively affect our financial results any new disruptions in the financial markets may also adversely affect the us and world economy which could negatively impact consumer spending patterns changes in the capital markets could also have significant effects on our pension plan our pension income or expense is affected by factors including the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for the pension plan for some of our employees the weighted average asset allocation and longterm rate of return of our pension plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the interest cost component of our net periodic pension cost if our pension plan assets do not achieve positive rates of return or if our estimates and assumed rates are not accurate our earnings may decrease because net periodic pension costs would rise and we could be required to provide additional funds to cover our obligations to employees under the pension plan 

we face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees and licensees 

certain of our domestic and all of our international locations other than in canada are operated by franchisees or licensees we believe that we have selected highcaliber operating partners and franchisees with significant experience in restaurant operations and are providing them with training and support however the probability of opening ultimate success and quality of any franchise or licensed restaurant rests principally with the franchisee or licensee if the franchisee or licensee does not successfully open and operate its restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards or guests have negative experiences due to issues with food quality or operational execution our brand values could suffer which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we face a variety of risks associated with doing business with business partners and vendors in foreign markets 

we are making efforts to expand our brands overseas through licensing and franchising relationships there is no assurance that international operations will be profitable or that international growth will continue our international operations are subject to all of the same risks associated with our domestic operations as well as a number of additional risks these include among other things international economic and political conditions foreign currency fluctuations and differing cultures and consumer preferences in addition expansion into international markets could create risks to our brands and reputation 

we also are subject to governmental regulations throughout the world that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors these include antitrust and tax requirements antiboycott regulations importexportcustoms regulations and other international trade regulations the usa patriot act the foreign corrupt practices act and applicable local law failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business 

we regard our olive garden ®  longhorn steakhouse ®  cheddar’s scratch kitchen ®  yard house ®  the capital grille ®  the capital burger ®  bahama breeze ®  seasons 52 ®  eddie v’s prime seafood ®  darden ® and darden restaurants ® service marks and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts copyrights patents trademarks service marks and other common law rights such as trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our restaurants and services from infringement we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the united states and foreign jurisdictions however we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other persons although our policy is to oppose any such infringement further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources 

impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment of goodwill exists factors may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and slower growth rates any adverse change in these factors would have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations we compute the amount of impairment by comparing the implied fair

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets primarily the longhorn steakhouse ®  cheddar’s scratch kitchen ®  the capital grille ®  yard house ® and eddie v’s prime seafood ®  trademarks to determine if they are definite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

as with goodwill we test our indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

failure of our internal controls over financial reporting and future changes in accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results affect our reported results of operations or otherwise harm our business and financial results 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud our growth and acquisition of other restaurant companies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud a significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation 

a change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future changes to existing accounting rules or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our reported financial results additionally our assumptions estimates and judgments related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including but not limited to revenue recognition fair value of investments impairment of longlived assets leases and related economic transactions derivatives pension and postretirement benefits intangibles selfinsurance income taxes property and equipment unclaimed property laws and litigation and stockbased compensation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by us changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend this discussion and analysis below for darden restaurants inc darden the company we us or our should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related financial statement notes included in part ii of this report under the caption “item 8  financial statements and supplementary data” we operate on a 5253week fiscal year which ends on the last sunday in may fiscal 2018  which ended may 27 2018  consisted of 52 weeks fiscal 2017  which ended may 28 2017  consisted of 52 weeks and fiscal 2016  which ended may 29 2016  consisted of 52 weeks 

overview of operations 

our business operates in the fullservice dining segment of the restaurant industry at may 27 2018  we operated 1746  restaurants through subsidiaries in the united states and canada under the olive garden ®  longhorn steakhouse ®  cheddar’s scratch kitchen ®  yard house ®  the capital grille ®  bahama breeze ®  seasons 52 ®  and eddie v’s prime seafood ®  trademarks we own and operate all of our restaurants in the united states and canada except for 3  joint venture restaurants managed by us and 36  franchised restaurants we also have 35  franchised restaurants in operation located in latin america the middle east and malaysia all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

on april 24 2017 we completed the acquisition of cheddar’s scratch kitchen for 7998 million  in total consideration the acquired operations of cheddar’s scratch kitchen included 140 companyowned restaurants and 25 franchised restaurants on august 28 2017 we completed the acquisition of 11 cheddar’s scratch kitchen franchised restaurants from an existing franchisee the results of operations financial position and cash flows of cheddar’s scratch kitchen are included in our consolidated financial statements as of the date of acquisition see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report for further details 

we believe that capable operators of strong multiunit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the restaurant industry’s fullservice segment generally the restaurant industry is considered to be comprised of three segments quick service fast casual and full service all of our restaurants fall within the fullservice segment which is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains we believe we have strong brands and that the breadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the fullservice segment of the restaurant industry this collective capability is the product of investments over many years in areas that are critical to success in our business including restaurant operations excellence brand management excellence supply chain talent management and information technology among other things 

with a focus on growing samerestaurant sales we’ve implemented a “backtobasics” approach rooted in strong operating fundamentals we’re focused on improving culinary innovation and execution inside each of our brands delivering attentive service to each and every one of our guests and creating an inviting and engaging atmosphere inside our restaurants we support these priorities with smart and relevant integrated marketing programs that resonate with our guests by delivering on these operational and brandbuilding imperatives we expect to increase our market share through new restaurant and samerestaurant sales growth and deliver bestinclass profitability 

the darden support structure enables our brands to achieve their ultimate potential through 1 driving advantages in supply chain and general and administrative support 2 applying insights collected from our significant guest and transactional databases to enhance guest relationships and identify new opportunities to drive sales growth 3 relentlessly driving operating efficiencies and continuous improvement operating with a sense of urgency and inspiring a performancedriven culture and 4 our commitment to rigorous strategic planning 

we seek to increase profits by leveraging our fixed and semifixed costs with sales from new restaurants and increased guest traffic and sales at existing restaurants to evaluate our operations and assess our financial performance we monitor a number of operating measures with a special focus on two key factors 

  

 increasing samerestaurant sales can improve segment profit because these incremental sales provide better leverage of our fixed and semifixed restaurantlevel costs a restaurant brand can generate samerestaurant sales increases through increases in guest traffic increases in the average guest check or a combination of the two the average guest check can be impacted by menu price changes and by the mix of menu items sold for each restaurant brand we gather daily sales data and regularly analyze the guest traffic counts and the mix of menu items sold to aid in developing menu pricing product offerings and promotional strategies we focus on balancing our pricing and product offerings with other initiatives to produce sustainable samerestaurant 

sales growth we compute samerestaurant sales using restaurants open at least 16 months because this period is generally required for new restaurant sales levels to normalize sales at newly opened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation due to operating inefficiencies our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of new restaurant openings and closings and relocations and remodeling of existing restaurants preopening expenses each period reflect the costs associated with opening new restaurants in current and future periods 

fiscal 2018 financial highlights 

our sales from continuing operations were 808 billion  in fiscal 2018  compared to 717 billion  in fiscal 2017  the 127 percent  increase in sales from continuing operations was primarily driven by revenue from the 151 acquired cheddar’s scratch kitchen restaurants a combined darden samerestaurant sales increase of 23 percent  excluding cheddar’s scratch kitchen and the addition of 40  net new companyowned restaurants 

net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2018  were 6038 million   479  per diluted share compared with net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2017  of 4825 million   383  per diluted share net earnings and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2018  increased 251 percent  compared with fiscal 2017  

our net loss from discontinued operations was 78 million   006  per diluted share for fiscal 2018  compared with a net loss from discontinued operations of 34 million   003  per diluted share for fiscal 2017  when combined with results from continuing operations our diluted net earnings per share were 473  and 380  for fiscal 2018  and 2017  respectively 

outlook 

we expect fiscal 2019  sales from continuing operations to increase between 40 percent and 50 percent driven by combined darden samerestaurant sales growth of 10 percent to 20 percent and approximately 45 to 50 new restaurants in fiscal 2019  we expect our annual effective tax rate to be between 110 percent and 120 percent and we expect capital expenditures incurred to build new restaurants remodel and maintain existing restaurants and technology initiatives to be between 4250 million and 4750 million 

in june 2018  we announced a quarterly dividend of 075  per share payable on august 1 2018  based on the 075  quarterly dividend declaration our expected annual dividend is 300  per share which reflects an increase of 190 percent  compared to our fiscal 2018  annual dividend dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors and accordingly the timing and amount of our dividends are subject to change 

there are significant risks and challenges that could impact our operations and ability to increase sales and earnings the restaurant industry is intensely competitive and sensitive to economic cycles and other business factors including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits other risks and uncertainties are discussed in part i item 1a of this report

primarily due to a 08 impact from rent expense resulting from leasebacks of properties included in the spinoff of four corners property trust four corners and individual saleleasebacks collectively real estate transactions partially offset by a 04 impact from sales leverage 

 interest expense 

net interest expense increased as a percent of sales in fiscal 2018  primarily due to debt retirement costs of 1022 million  associated with the retirement of 3109 million  aggregate principal amount of longterm debt net interest expense decreased as a percent of sales in fiscal 2017  primarily due to debt retirement costs of 1068 million recorded in fiscal 2016 and lower average debt balances in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 due to the repayment of debt with proceeds from the real estate transactions and additional cash on hand 

income taxes 

the tax cuts and jobs act tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 and includes among other items a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 350 percent  to 210 percent  effective january 1 2018 our federal corporate income tax rate for fiscal 2018  was 294 percent  and represents a blended income tax rate for the current fiscal year for fiscal 2019  our federal corporate income tax rate will be 210 percent  additionally for the fiscal year ended may 27 2018  in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic 740 we remeasured our deferred tax balances to reflect the reduced rate that will apply when these deferred taxes are settled or realized in future periods the remeasurement resulted in a 793 million  onetime adjustment of our net deferred tax liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as of may 27 2018  and a corresponding income tax benefit reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal year ended may 27 2018  the securities and exchange commission sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin 118 which allows companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period that is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations while we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the impacts of the tax act adjustments may occur and may be affected by other factors including but not limited to further refinement of our calculations changes in interpretations and assumptions and regulatory changes from the internal revenue service irs the sec the financial accounting standards board and various tax jurisdictions 

the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  for continuing operations were 03 percent  243 percent  and 200 percent  respectively the decrease in the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the tax act and lower earnings before income taxes for fiscal 2018 driven primarily by debt retirement costs the increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to higher earnings before income taxes 

net earnings and net earnings per share from continuing operations 

net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2018  were 6038 million   479  per diluted share compared with net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2017  of 4825 million   383  per diluted share and net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2016  of 3597 million   278  per diluted share 

net earnings and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2018  increased 251 percent  compared with fiscal 2017  our diluted per share results from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 were positively impacted by the tax act by approximately 030 due to the lower federal corporate tax rate enacted during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 partially offset by approximately 010 related to workforce investments our diluted per share results from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 were also positively impacted by the tax act by approximately 062 due to a net benefit from deferred tax revaluation our diluted per share results from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 were adversely impacted by approximately 054 related to debt retirement costs and approximately 010 related to costs associated with the integration of cheddar’s scratch kitchen 

net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2017  increased 341 percent  and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 378 percent  compared with fiscal 2016  our diluted per share results from continuing operations for fiscal 2017 were adversely impacted by approximately 010 due to a noncash pension settlement charge and approximately 009 related to the acquisition and integration of cheddar’s scratch kitchen

segment results 

we manage our restaurant brands olive garden longhorn steakhouse cheddar’s scratch kitchen the capital grille yard house bahama breeze seasons 52 and eddie v’s in the us and canada as operating segments we aggregate our operating segments into reportable segments based on a combination of the size economic characteristics and subsegment of fullservice dining within which each brand operates our four reportable segments are 1 olive garden 2 longhorn steakhouse 3 fine dining and 4 other business see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report for further details 

our management uses segment profit as the measure for assessing performance of our segments the following table presents segment profit margin for the periods indicated 

the increase in the olive garden segment profit margin for fiscal 2018 was driven primarily by leveraging positive samerestaurant sales the decrease in olive garden’s segment profit margin for fiscal 2017 was driven primarily by additional rent expense resulting from the real estate transactions the increase in the longhorn segment profit margin for fiscal 2018 was driven primarily by leveraging positive samerestaurant sales longhorn’s segment profit margins for fiscal 2017 were flat as additional rent expense resulting from the real estate transactions was offset by food cost deflation the increase in the fine dining segment profit margin for fiscal 2018 was driven primarily by leveraging positive samerestaurant sales the increase in fine dining’s segment profit margins for fiscal 2017 was driven primarily by food cost deflation primarily beef partially offset by higher restaurant expenses the decrease in other business’ segment profit margin for fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by the impact of cheddar’s scratch kitchen’s margin mix and the shift of consumerpackaged goods revenue from the other business segment to primarily the olive garden segment the other business segment profit margins for fiscal 2017 were flat as food cost deflation was offset by higher labor costs 

seasonality 

our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally typically our average sales per restaurant are highest in the winter and spring followed by the summer and lowest in the fall holidays changes in the economy severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions because of the seasonality of our business results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

impact of inflation 

we attempt to minimize the annual effects of inflation through appropriate planning operating practices and menu price increases we do not believe inflation had a significant overall effect on our annual results of operations during fiscal 2018  2017  or 2016 

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially 

different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions we consider the following estimates to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

leases 

we evaluate our leases at their inception to estimate their expected term which commences on the date when we have the right to control the use of the leased property and includes the noncancelable base term plus all option periods we are reasonably assured to exercise our judgment in determining the appropriate expected term for each lease affects our evaluation of 

 these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different expected lease terms were used 

valuation of longlived assets 

land buildings and equipment and certain other assets including definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the judgments we make related to the expected useful lives of longlived assets definitions of lease terms and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of these assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets changes in economic conditions changes in usage or operating performance desirability of the restaurant sites and other factors such as our ability to sell our assets held for sale as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our longlived assets significant adverse changes in these factors could cause us to realize an impairment loss based on a review of operating results for each of our restaurants the amount of net book value associated with lower performing restaurants that would be deemed at risk for impairment is not material to our consolidated financial statements 

valuation and recoverability of goodwill and trademarks 

goodwill and trademarks are not subject to amortization and have been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing the reporting units are our restaurant brands at may 27 2018  we had the following amounts recorded as goodwill and trademarks at our brands 

a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and slower growth rates any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

we performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill and trademarks as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter using a qualitative assessment in considering the qualitative approach we evaluated factors including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions market and industry conditions commodity cost fluctuations competitive environment share price 

performance results of prior impairment tests operational stability and the overall financial performance of the reporting units based on the results of our qualitative assessment no impairment of goodwill or trademarks was indicated changes in circumstances existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future or in the numerous estimates associated with management’s judgments and assumptions made in assessing the fair value of our goodwill and trademarks could result in an impairment loss of a portion or all of our goodwill or trademarks as we finalized the purchase price allocation for cheddar’s scratch kitchen during our fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 we excluded the goodwill and trademark related to cheddar’s scratch kitchen from our qualitative assessment 

if our annual test resulted in an impairment of our goodwill or trademarks our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected and our leverage ratio for purposes of our credit agreement would increase a leverage ratio exceeding the maximum permitted under our credit agreement would be a default under our credit agreement at may 27 2018  a writedown of goodwill other indefinitelived intangible assets or any other assets in excess of approximately 112 billion would have been required to cause our leverage ratio to exceed the permitted maximum as our leverage ratio is determined on a quarterly basis and due to the seasonal nature of our business a lesser amount of impairment in future quarters could cause our leverage ratio to exceed the permitted maximum 

unearned revenues 

unearned revenues represent our liability for gift cards that have been sold but not yet redeemed the estimated value of gift cards expected to remain unused is recognized over the expected period of redemption as the remaining gift card values are redeemed generally over a period of 12 years utilizing this method we estimate both the amount of breakage and the time period of redemption if actual redemption patterns vary from our estimates actual gift card breakage income may differ from the amounts recorded we update our estimates of our redemption period and our breakage rate periodically and apply that rate to gift card redemptions changing our breakagerate assumption on unredeemed gift cards by 25 basis points would result in an adjustment in our unearned revenues of approximately 230 million 

income taxes 

we estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes these estimates include among other items depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported employee tip income effective rates for state and local income taxes and the tax deductibility of certain other items we adjust our annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available 

assessment of uncertain tax positions requires judgments relating to the amounts timing and likelihood of resolution as described in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report the 174 million  balance of unrecognized state tax benefits at may 27 2018  includes 20 million  related to tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts could change during the next 12 months based on the outcome of examinations the 20 million  relates to items that would impact our effective income tax rate 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows generated from operating activities are our principal source of liquidity which we use to finance capital expenditures for new restaurants and to remodel and maintain existing restaurants to pay dividends to our shareholders and to repurchase shares of our common stock since substantially all of our sales are for cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable are generally due in 5 to 45 days we are able to carry current liabilities in excess of current assets in addition to cash flows from operations we use a combination of longterm and shortterm borrowings to fund our capital needs 

we currently manage our business and financial ratios to target an investmentgrade bond rating which has historically allowed flexible access to financing at reasonable costs our publicly issued longterm debt currently carries the following ratings 

 our commercial paper has ratings of 



these ratings are as of the date of the filing of this report and have been obtained with the understanding that moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch will continue to monitor our credit and make future adjustments to these ratings to the extent warranted the ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our securities may be changed superseded or withdrawn at any time and should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

on october 27 2017 we entered into a new 7500 million  revolving credit agreement with bank of america na boa as administrative agent and the lenders and other agents party thereto the revolving credit agreement is a senior unsecured credit commitment to the company and contains customary representations and affirmative and negative covenants including limitations on liens and subsidiary debt and a maximum consolidated lease adjusted total debt to total capitalization ratio of 075  to 100 and events of default usual for credit facilities of this type the revolving credit agreement replaced our prior 7500 million  revolving credit agreement dated as of october 3 2011 and amended as of october 24 2013 as of may 27 2018  we were in compliance with all covenants under the revolving credit agreement 

the revolving credit agreement matures on october 27 2022  and the proceeds may be used for working capital and capital expenditures the refinancing of certain indebtedness certain acquisitions and general corporate purposes loans under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at a rate of libor plus a margin determined by reference to a ratingsbased pricing grid applicable margin or the base rate which is defined as the highest of the boa prime rate the federal funds rate plus 0500 percent  and the eurocurrency rate plus 100 percent plus the applicable margin assuming a “bbb” equivalent credit rating level the applicable margin under the revolving credit agreement will be 1000 percent  for libor loans and 0 percent  for base rate loans as of may 27 2018  we had no outstanding balances under the revolving credit agreement

the interest rate on our 428 million   6800 percent  senior notes due october 2037  is subject to adjustment from time to time if the debt rating assigned to such series of notes is downgraded below a certain rating level or subsequently upgraded the maximum adjustment is 2000 percent  above the initial interest rate and the interest rate cannot be reduced below the initial interest rate as of may 27 2018  no such adjustments are made to this rate

a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at may 27 2018  is as follows 



 

our fixedcharge coverage ratio which measures the number of times each year that we earn enough to cover our fixed charges amounted to 31  times and 50  times on a continuing operations basis for the fiscal years ended may 27 2018  and may 28 2017  respectively our adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio as of may 27 2018  which includes 600  times the combined total annual minimum rent for operating leases and annual minimum lease payments for financing leases on a consolidated basis of  3427 million  as a component of adjusted debt and adjusted total capital was 60 percent  our adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio as of may 28 2017  which includes 625  times the combined total annual minimum rent for operating leases and annual minimum lease payments for financing leases on a consolidated basis of  3035 million  as a component of adjusted debt and adjusted total capital was 59 percent  we include the leasedebt equivalent and contractual lease guarantees in our adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio reported to shareholders as we believe its inclusion better represents the optimal capital structure that we target from period to period and because it is consistent with the calculation of the covenant under our revolving credit agreement 

based on these ratios we believe our financial condition is strong the composition of our capital structure is shown in the following table 



net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations were 102 billion  9163 million  and 8204 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively net cash flows provided by operating activities include net earnings from continuing operations of 6038 million  4825 million  and 3597 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased in fiscal 2018  primarily due to higher net earnings from continuing operations net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased in fiscal 2017  primarily due to higher net earnings from continuing operations partially offset by the timing of payments of accounts payable and current period activity of taxable timing differences 

net cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations were 4511 million  in fiscal 2018  compared to net cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations of 107 billion  in fiscal 2017  and net cash flows provided by investing activities from continuing operations of 754 million  in fiscal 2016  capital expenditures incurred principally for building new restaurants remodeling existing restaurants replacing equipment and technology initiatives were 3960 million  in fiscal 2018  compared to 2930 million  in fiscal 2017  and 2283 million  in fiscal 2016  additionally for fiscal 2018  net cash used in the acquisition of 11 cheddar’s scratch kitchen restaurants from an existing franchisee was 404 million  for fiscal 2017  net cash used in the acquisition of cheddar’s scratch kitchen was 7644 million  for fiscal 2016  proceeds from the disposal of land buildings and equipment of 3252 million  reflect the impact of closed saleleaseback transactions 

net cash flows used in financing activities from continuing operations were 6366 million  in fiscal 2018  compared to net cash flows provided by financing activities from continuing operations of 1292 million  in fiscal 2017  and net cash flows used in financing activities from continuing operations 112 billion  in fiscal 2016  net cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2018  reflected longterm debt payments of 4082 million  including repurchase premiums and makewhole provisions 

repayments of shortterm debt of 9600 million  dividend payments of 3135 million  and share repurchases of 2348 million  partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of shortterm debt of 9600 million  proceeds from the issuance of 3000 million  of senior notes and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options net cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal 2017  reflect proceeds from the issuance of 5000 million  of senior notes and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options partially offset by dividend payments of 2791 million  and share repurchases of 2302 million  net cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2016  reflected longterm debt payments of 110 billion  including repurchase premiums and makewhole provisions dividend payments of 2682 million  and share repurchases of 1848 million  partially offset by the 3150 million  cash dividend received by us from four corners 

our defined benefit and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are determined using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies prescribed under financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic 715 compensation  retirement benefits and topic 712 compensation  nonretirement postemployment benefits we use certain assumptions including but not limited to the selection of a discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we set the discount rate assumption annually for each plan at its valuation date to reflect the yield of highquality fixedincome debt instruments with lives that approximate the maturity of the plan benefits at may 27 2018  our discount rate was 432 percent  and 428 percent  respectively for our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based upon several factors including our historical assumptions compared with actual results an analysis of current market conditions asset allocations and the views of leading financial advisers and economists our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for our defined benefit plans was 575  percent for fiscal year 2018  65  percent for fiscal year 2017  and 65 percent  for fiscal year 2016  we made defined benefit plans contributions of approximately 608 million  04 million  and 254 million  in fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively we expect to contribute approximately 04 million  to our defined benefit pension plans and approximately 14 million  to our postretirement benefit plan during fiscal 2019  in april 2018 our benefit plans committee approved the termination of our primary noncontributory defined benefit pension plan the retirement income plan for darden restaurants inc the termination of the plan involves many steps including filing information with the irs and the pension benefit guaranty corporation and obtaining proper approvals we anticipate the termination process which culminates in either the settlement or transfer of participant benefits will take approximately two years to complete 

we have recognized net losses of 854 million  net of tax and of 22 million  net of tax as components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the defined benefit plans and postretirement benefit plan respectively as of may 27 2018  these net losses represent changes in the amount of the projected benefit obligation and plan assets resulting from differences in the assumptions used and actual experience the amortization of the net loss component of our fiscal 2019  net periodic benefit cost for the defined benefit plans is expected to be approximately 19 million net of tax the amortization of the net gain component of our fiscal 2019  net periodic benefit cost for the postretirement benefit plan is expected to be approximately 24 million net of tax 

we believe our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the factors discussed above however other assumptions could also be reasonably applied that could differ from the assumptions used these changes in assumptions would not significantly impact our funding requirements 

we are not aware of any trends or events that would materially affect our capital requirements or liquidity we believe that our internal cashgenerating capabilities the potential issuance of unsecured debt securities under our shelf registration statement and shortterm commercial paper should be sufficient to finance our capital expenditures debt maturities stock repurchase program and other operating activities through fiscal 2019  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are not a party to any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition sales or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

financial condition 

our total current assets were 5536 million  at may 27 2018  compared with 5879 million  at may 28 2017  the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents driven by the repurchase of shares of our common stock 

our total current liabilities were 138 billion  at may 27 2018  compared with 129 billion  at may 28 2017  the increase was primarily due to an increase in unearned revenues associated with gift card sales in excess of redemptions an increase in accrued payroll related to bonuses and an increase in accounts payable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates compensation and commodity prices to manage this exposure we periodically enter into interest rate and foreign currency exchange instruments equity forward and commodity derivative instruments for other than trading purposes see notes 1 and 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report 

we use the variancecovariance method to measure value at risk over time horizons ranging from one week to one year at the 95 percent confidence level at may 27 2018  our potential losses in future net earnings resulting from changes in equity forwards commodity instruments and floating rate debt interest rate exposures were approximately 317 million over a period of one year the value at risk from an increase in the fair value of all of our longterm fixedrate debt over a period of one year was approximately 1013 million the fair value of our longterm fixedrate debt outstanding as of may 27 2018  averaged 104 billion with a high of 109 billion and a low of 9159 million during fiscal 2018  our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows by targeting an appropriate mix of variable and fixedrate debt

strategy 

we believe that capable operators of strong multiunit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the restaurant industry’s fullservice segment generally the restaurant industry is considered to be comprised of three segments quick service fast casual and full service all of our restaurants fall within the fullservice segment which is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains we believe we have strong brands and that the breadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the fullservice restaurant industry this collective capability is the product of investments over many years in areas that are critical to success in our business including restaurant operations excellence brand management excellence supply chain talent management and information technology among other things 

during fiscal 2017 our operating philosophy remained focused on improving the core operational fundamentals of the business by providing an outstanding guest experience rooted in culinary innovation attentive service engaging atmosphere and integrated marketing darden enables each brand to reach its full potential by leveraging its scale insight and experience in a way that protects uniqueness and competitive advantages additionally brands can capitalize on insights to deliver customized onetoone customer relationship marketing we hold ourselves accountable for operating our restaurants with a sense of urgency to achieve our commitments to all of our stakeholders 

recent and planned restaurant growth 

during fiscal 2017  we added 159  net new companyowned restaurants in the united states including the cheddar’s scratch kitchen companyowned restaurants acquired in april 2017 our fiscal 2017  actual restaurant openings and closings fiscal 2018  projected openings and approximate capital investment square footage and dining capacity by brand are shown below 



 

the actual number of openings for each of our brands for fiscal 2018  will depend on many factors including our ability to locate appropriate sites negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms obtain necessary local governmental permits complete construction and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel our objective is to continue to expand all of our restaurant brands 

we consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant’s longterm success and we devote significant effort to the site selection process prior to entering a market we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors these factors include trade area demographics such as target population density and household income levels competitive influences in the trade area the site’s visibility accessibility and traffic volume and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls hotelmotel complexes offices and universities members of senior management evaluate inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after permits are obtained and the site is acquired 

we systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards when a restaurant falls below minimum standards we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes and implement marketing and operational plans to improve that restaurant’s performance if performance does not improve to acceptable levels the restaurant is evaluated for relocation closing or conversion to one of our other brands permanent closures are typically due to economic changes in trade areas the expiration of lease agreements or site concerns accordingly we continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges

we maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our managementlevel team members we believe that our leadership position strong resultsoriented culture and various shortterm and longterm incentive programs including stockbased compensation enhances our ability to attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers 

quality assurance 

our total quality department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe highquality food in a clean and safe environment through rigorous supplier and risk based product evaluations we purchase only products that meet or exceed our product specifications we rely on independent third parties to inspect and evaluate our suppliers and distributors suppliers that produce “highrisk” products are subject to a food safety evaluation by darden personnel at least annually we require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive hazard analysis and critical control point haccp food safety programs and risk based preventative controls adopted by the us food and drug administration these programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause foodborne illnesses by applying scientificallybased controls to analyze hazards identify and monitor critical control points and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met we require routine food safety verification for high risk products from our suppliers our total quality managers and third party auditors visit each restaurant regularly throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation the total quality managers also serve as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety 

purchasing and distribution 

our ability to ensure a consistent supply of safe highquality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant brands depends on reliable sources of procurement our purchasing staff sources negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 1500 suppliers whose products originate in more than 35 countries suppliers must meet our requirements and strict quality control standards in the development harvest catch and production of food products competitive bids longterm contracts and strategic supplier relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products 

we believe that our significant scale is a competitive advantage and our purchasing team leverages this purchasing capability our purchasing staff travels routinely within the united states and internationally to source topquality food products at competitive prices we believe that we have established excellent longterm relationships with key suppliers and usually source our product directly from producers not brokers or middlemen we actively support several national minority supplier organizations to ensure that darden incorporates women and minorityowned businesses in all of its purchasing decisions 

we continue to drive automation of our supply chain by working with our suppliers logistics partners and distributors to improve optimization with information visibility through our subsidiary darden direct distribution inc darden direct and longterm agreements with our third party national distribution companies we maintain inventory ownership of food and supplies in warehouses primarily dedicated to darden where practical to do so darden direct further enables our purchasing staff to integrate demand forecasts into longterm agreements driving efficiencies in production economics when we collaborate with suppliers because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales 

advertising and marketing 

integrated marketing is a key element of our strategy and our scale enables us to be a leading advertiser in the fullservice dining segment of the restaurant industry olive garden leverages the efficiency of national network television advertising olive garden supplements this with cable local television and digital advertising longhorn steakhouse uses local television and digital advertising to build engagement and loyalty by market cheddar’s scratch kitchen the capital grille yard house bahama breeze seasons 52 and eddie v’s do not use television advertising but rely on local and digital marketing our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to build awareness and strengthen our brands we implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase our sales and profits as well as increase frequency of visitation by our guests we also rely on outdoor billboard direct mail and email advertising as well as radio newspapers digital coupons search engine marketing and social media such as facebook® and instagram® as appropriate to attract engage and retain our guests we have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor guest satisfaction and evolving food service trends and expectations 

in fiscal 2017 we continued a multiyear effort to implement new technology platforms that allow us to digitally engage with our guests and team members and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities in this increasingly connected society we also continued making improvements to our online and mobile ordering system for olive garden and longhorn steakhouse in addition we continued to further improve brand loyalty and customer relationship management programs for our brands to increase the frequency of visits and offer our guests flexibility when making dining decisions as we implement new platforms we are integrating them into all guest touch points including restaurant operating systems to enable compelling personalized guest experiences 

 in fiscal 2017 olive garden continued to leverage spanish language advertising to increase awareness and visits from hispanic consumers

information technology 

we strive for leadership in the restaurant business by using technology as a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy we have implemented technologyenabled business solutions targeted at improved financial control cost management guest service and employee effectiveness these solutions are designed to be used across restaurant brands yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant brand our strategy is to fully integrate systems to drive operational efficiencies and enable restaurant teams to focus on restaurant operations excellence 

restaurant hardware and software support for all of our restaurant brands is provided or coordinated from the restaurant support center facility in orlando florida a highspeed data network sends and receives critical business data to and from the restaurants throughout the day and night providing timely and extensive information on business activity in every location our data center contains sufficient computing power to process information from all restaurants quickly and efficiently our information is processed in a secure environment to protect both the actual data and the physical assets we guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan which includes storing critical business information offsite testing the disaster recovery plan at a hostsite facility and providing onsite power backup we use internally developed proprietary software as well as purchased software with proven nonproprietary hardware this allows processing power to be distributed effectively to each of our restaurants 

our management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates will position us well to support current needs and future growth we use a strategic information systems planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic financial regulatory and other business advantage criteria 

competition 

the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food price service restaurant location personnel brand attractiveness of facilities availability of carryout and home delivery internet and mobile ordering capabilites and effectiveness of advertising and marketing the restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing restaurants and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power we compete within each market with national and regional chains and locallyowned restaurants for guests management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites we also face growing competition from the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section in addition improving product offerings at fast casual restaurants and quickservice restaurants and expansion of home delivery services together with negative economic conditions could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives we expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas 

other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled “purchasing and distribution” “advertising and marketing” and “information technology” in this item 1 and in our risk factors in item 1a of this form 10k

seasonality 

our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally typically our average sales per restaurant are highest in the winter and spring followed by the summer and lowest in the fall holidays changes in the economy severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions because of the seasonality of our business results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

government regulation

during fiscal 2017  126 percent  of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site in most cases on an annual basis and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time these regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant operation including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours of operation advertising wholesale purchasing inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages the failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these licenses would adversely affect the restaurant’s operations we also are subject in certain states to “dramshop” statutes which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person who then causes injury to himself or a third party we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance

the inability to successfully integrate cheddar’s scratch kitchen into our business could harm our ability to achieve the cost savings and other benefits we expect to be able to realize in the cheddar’s scratch kitchen operations 

on april 24 2017 we acquired cheddar’s scratch kitchen our integration of cheddar’s scratch kitchen’s business into our operations is a complex and timeconsuming process that may not be successful the primary areas of focus for successfully combining the business of cheddar’s scratch kitchen with our operations may include among others retaining and integrating management and other key employees integrating information communications and other systems and managing the growth of the combined company 

even if we successfully integrate the business of cheddar’s scratch kitchen into our operations there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits we acquired cheddar’s scratch kitchen with the expectation that the acquisition would result in various benefits for the combined company including among others business and growth opportunities and significant synergies from increased efficiency in purchasing distribution and other restaurant and corporate support increased competition andor deterioration in business conditions may limit our ability to expand this business as such we may not be able to realize the synergies goodwill business opportunities and growth prospects anticipated in connection with the acquisition 

we rely heavily on information technology in our operations and insufficient guest or employee facing technology or a failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network free from material failure interruption or security breach could harm our ability to effectively operate our business andor result in the loss of respected relationships with our guests or employees 

we rely heavily on information systems across our operations including for marketing programs employee engagement management of our supply chain pointofsale processing system in our restaurants and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems in addition we must effectively respond to changing guest expectations and new technological developments disruptions failures or other performance issues with these guest facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our business and negatively affect our relationship with our guests the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems a material network breach in the security of these systems as a result of a cyber attack or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to us or an individual this could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets or the improper use of personal information or other “identity theft” each of these situations or data privacy breaches may cause delays in guest service reduce efficiency in our operations require significant capital investments to remediate the problem result in customer or advertiser dissatisfaction or otherwise result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation and we could be subjected to litigation regulatory investigations or the imposition of penalties as privacy and information security laws and regulations change and cyber risks evolve we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance and protect guest employee and company information 

a failure to maintain food safety throughout the supply chain and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

food safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe quality food products even with strong preventative interventions and controls food safety issues could be caused at the source or by food suppliers or distributors and as a result be out of our control and require prompt action to mitigate impact in addition regardless of the source or cause any report of foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a norovirus or salmonella and other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination at one of our restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our brands and have a negative impact on our sales even instances of foodborne illness food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients resulting in higher costs and lower margins 

litigation including allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees guests suppliers shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation these actions and proceedings may involve allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices including wage and hour violations and employment discrimination guest discrimination food safety issues including poor food quality foodborne illness food tampering food contamination and adverse health effects from consumption of various food products or highcalorie foods including obesity other personal injury violation of “dram shop” laws providing an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or a third party trademark infringement violation of the federal securities laws or other concerns the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of 

very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time the cost to defend litigation may be significant there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease guest acceptance of our brands regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are found liable litigation could impact our operations in other ways as well allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices for example could adversely affect employee acquisition and retention as a result litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable publicity or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could harm our reputation and adversely impact our guest counts and sales 

the good reputation of our restaurant brands is a key factor in the success of our business actual or alleged incidents at any of our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could harm our brands even incidents occurring at restaurants operated by our competitors or in the supply chain generally could result in negative publicity that could harm the restaurant industry overall and indirectly our own brands negative publicity may result from allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices employee dissatisfaction guest discrimination illness injury or any of the other matters discussed above that could give rise to litigation regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants or only to a single restaurant could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand negative publicity also may result from health concerns including food safety and flu outbreaks publication of government or industry findings concerning food products environmental disasters crime incidents data privacy breaches scandals involving our employees or operational problems at our restaurants all of which could make our brands and menu offerings less appealing to our guests and negatively impact our guest counts and sales adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of our brands or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to a number of risks relating to public policy changes and federal state and local regulation of our business including in the areas of health care reform environmental matters minimum wage unionization data privacy menu labeling immigration requirements and taxes and an insufficient or ineffective response to government regulation may impact our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability 

the restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal state local and international laws and regulations the development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites which are subject to building zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations and requirements we are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health sanitation safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food including regulations regarding product safety nutritional content and menu labeling we are subject to federal state and local laws governing employment practices and working conditions these laws cover wage and hour practices labor relations paid and family leave workplace safety and immigration among others the myriad of laws and regulations being passed at the state and local level creates unique challenges for a multistate employer as different standards apply to different locations sometimes with conflicting requirements we must continue to monitor and adapt our employment practices to comply with these various laws and regulations 

we also are subject to federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities such as the ada compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation new or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our labor costs 

provisions in the affordable care act require restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus and to make available more detailed nutrition information upon request however regulations implementing those statutory provisions have been delayed until may 2018 we do not expect to incur any material costs from compliance with these provisions but cannot anticipate any changes to guest behavior resulting from the implementation of this portion of the law which could have an adverse effect on our sales or results of operations 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge emission and disposal of hazardous materials there also has been increasing focus by united states and overseas governmental authorities on other environmental matters such as climate change the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption this increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating a yet to be specified array of environmental matters such as the emission of greenhouse gases where “cap and trade” initiatives could effectively impose a tax on carbon emissions legislative regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials taxes transportation and utilities which could decrease our operating profits and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment 

we are subject to laws relating to information security privacy cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud an increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information including social security numbers financial information including credit card numbers and health information compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and any failure or perceived failure to comply with those laws or any breach of our systems could harm our reputation or lead to litigation which could adversely affect our financial condition 

the impact of current laws and regulations the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues could negatively impact our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal state and local authorities could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings 

a majority of our restaurants are operated in leased properties and we are committed to longterm and noncancelable leases that we may want to cancel and may be unable to renew the leases that we may want to extend at the end of their terms 

as of may 28 2017  1606  of our 1695  restaurants operating in the united states and canada operate in leased locations if we close a restaurant in a leased location we may remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease which would include among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term additionally the potential losses associated with our inability to cancel leases may result in our keeping open restaurant locations that are performing significantly below targeted levels as a result ongoing lease obligations at closed or underperforming restaurant locations could impair our results of operations in addition at the end of the lease term and expiration of all renewal periods we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost if at all as a result we may be required to close or relocate a restaurant which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks and may have an adverse effect on our operating performance 

we may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs 

our restaurant operations are subject to united states and canadian federal state and local laws governing such matters as minimum wages working conditions overtime and tip credits as federal and state minimum wage rates increase we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage labor shortages increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs this in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales conversely if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices our profitability may decline in addition the current premiums that we pay for our insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property health and directors’ and officers’ liability may increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs the dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers’ compensation and general liability insurance for which we carry high perclaim deductibles may also increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs further the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses 

our inability or failure to execute on a comprehensive business continuity plan following a major natural disaster such as a hurricane or manmade disaster including terrorism at our corporate facility could have a materially adverse impact on our business 

many of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one florida location   we have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature including hurricanes and other natural disasters and back up and offsite locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information however if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans we may experience delays in recovery of data inability to perform vital corporate functions tardiness in required reporting and compliance failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims 

health concerns arising from foodrelated pandemics outbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

the united states and other countries have experienced or may experience in the future outbreaks of viruses such as norovirus avian flu or “sars” h1n1 or “swine flu” or other diseases to the extent that a virus or disease is foodborne or perceived to be foodborne future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product or could reduce public confidence in food handling andor public assembly for example public concern over avian flu may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry the 

inability to serve poultrybased products would restrict our ability to provide a variety of menu items to our guests if we change a restaurant menu in response to such concerns we may lose guests who do not prefer the new menu and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new guest base to produce the sales needed to make the restaurant profitable we also may have different or additional competitors for our intended guests as a result of such a change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors if a virus is transmitted by human contact our employees or guests could become infected or could choose or be advised to avoid gathering in public places any of which could adversely affect our restaurant guest traffic and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level we also could be adversely affected if the world health organization andor the centers for disease control were to restrict travel to affected geographic areas where we source our products thus possibly impacting the continuity of supply additionally jurisdictions in which we have restaurants may impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition and if we have an insufficient focus on competition and the consumer landscape our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

the fullservice dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing service location personnel takeout and delivery options and type and quality of food and there are many wellestablished competitors we compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locallyowned restaurants we also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services particularly in the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section we compete primarily on the quality variety and value perception of menu items the number and location of restaurants type of brand quality and efficiency of service attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors we anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors if we are unable to continue to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our failure to drive both shortterm and longterm profitable sales growth through brand relevance operating excellence opening new restaurants of existing brands and developing new dining brands could result in poor financial performance 

as part of our business strategy we intend to drive profitable sales growth by increasing samerestaurant sales at existing restaurants continuing to expand our current portfolio of restaurant brands and developing additional brands that can be expanded profitably this strategy involves numerous risks and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives 

at existing brands we may not be able to maintain brand relevance and restaurant operating excellence to achieve sustainable samerestaurant sales growth and warrant new unit growth existing brand shortterm sales growth could be impacted if we are unable to drive near term guest count and sales growth and longterm sales growth could be impacted if we fail to extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to our guests a failure to innovate and extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to guests and occasions in order to generate sustainable samerestaurant traffic growth and produce nontraditional sales and earnings growth opportunities insufficient focus on our competition or failure to adequately address declines in the casual dining industry could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition we may not be able to support sustained new unit growth or open all of our planned new restaurants and the new restaurants that we open may not be profitable or as profitable as our existing restaurants new restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize and even sales at successful newlyopened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation the opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on guest counts and sales levels at existing restaurants 

the ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations the need to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses on a timely basis the need to comply with other regulatory requirements the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay construction increases in labor and building material costs the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms changes in weather or other acts of god that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions at each potential location we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites construction contractors management personnel hourly employees and other resources if we are unable to successfully manage these risks we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated sales and earnings in future periods 

we also may not be able to identify and integrate additional brands or develop new business opportunities that are as profitable as our existing restaurants 

a lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

the success of our restaurants depends in large part on their locations as demographic and economic patterns change current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations in addition desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation the occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may experience higherthananticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants we incur substantial preopening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close relocate or remodel existing restaurants the expenses of opening closing relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated an increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business 

  there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate each of which may harm our performance prospects or business the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction the dissemination of information online could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations regardless of the information’s accuracy 

  

many of our competitors are expanding their use of social media and new social media platforms are rapidly being developed potentially making more traditional social media platforms obsolete as a result we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies in order to maintain broad appeal with guests and brand relevance as part of our marketing efforts we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain guests we also continue to invest in other digital marketing initiatives that allow us to reach our guests across multiple digital channels and build their awareness of engagement with and loyalty to our brands these initiatives may not be successful resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues increased employee engagement or brand recognition in addition a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media including the improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about us exposure of personally identifiable information fraud or outofdate information the inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation 

a failure to identify and execute innovative marketing and guest relationship tactics ineffective or improper use of other marketing initiatives and increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

if our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions if our advertising media or marketing expenses increase or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors or if we do not adequately leverage technology and data analytic capabilities needed to generate concise competitive insight we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations a failure to sufficiently innovate develop guest relationship initiatives or maintain adequate and effective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales 

as part of our marketing efforts we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain guests these initiatives may not be successful and pose a variety of other risks as discussed below under the heading “our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business” 

a failure to recruit develop and retain effective leaders the loss or shortage of personnel with key capacities and skills or an inability to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction could impact our strategic direction and jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

our future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other employees our future growth also depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain highquality employees to work in and manage our restaurants we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees in order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth changes in senior management could expose us to significant changes in strategic direction and initiatives a failure to maintain appropriate organizational capacity and capability to support leadership excellence adequate resources innovative skill sets and expectations and build adequate bench strength required for growth a loss of key employees or a significant shortage of highquality restaurant employees and an inability to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction could lead to poor guest satisfaction higher turnover litigation and unionization which could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

a failure to address cost pressures including rising costs for commodities labor health care and utilities used by our restaurants and a failure to effectively deliver cost management activities and achieve economies of scale in purchasing could compress our margins and adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food ingredients labor health care utilities and other related costs over which we may have little control operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities including shrimp lobster crab and other seafood as well as beef pork chicken cheese and produce the introduction of or changes to tariffs on imported food products such as shrimp could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products we cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results we attempt to leverage our size to achieve economies of scale in purchasing but there can be no assurances that we can always do so effectively we are subject to the general risks of inflation 

increases in minimum wage health care and other benefit costs may have a material adverse effect on our labor costs we operate in many states and localities where the minimum wage is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage increases in minimum wage may also result in increases in the wage rates paid for nonminimum wage positions 

our restaurants’ operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as electricity and natural gas whether as a result of inflation or otherwise on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply in addition interruptions to the availability of gas electric water or other utilities whether due to aging infrastructure weather conditions fire animal damage trees digging accidents or other reasons largely out of our control may adversely affect our operations our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may lose sales or incur increased costs if our restaurants experience shortages or interruptions in the delivery of food and other products from our third party vendors and suppliers 

shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants may be caused by inclement weather natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods droughts and earthquakes the inability of our vendors to obtain credit in a tightened credit market or remain solvent given disruptions in the financial markets or other conditions beyond our control such shortages or interruptions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants we may have a limited number of suppliers for certain of our products supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our restaurant operations if we raise prices as a result of increased food costs or shortages it may negatively impact our sales if we temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular items from a restaurant’s menu that restaurant may experience a significant reduction in sales during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our guests changing their dining habits 

adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could adversely affect our restaurant sales 

adverse weather conditions can impact guest traffic at our restaurants cause the temporary underutilization of outdoor patio seating and in more severe cases such as hurricanes tornadoes or other natural disasters cause temporary closures sometimes for prolonged periods which would negatively impact our restaurant sales changes in weather could result in construction delays interruptions to the availability of utilities and shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies which could increase our costs some climatologists predict that the longterm effects of climate change and global warming may result in more severe volatile weather or extended droughts which could increase the frequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we may use to hedge exposures to fluctuations in commodity and broader market prices may cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we use or may use derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our principal ingredient labor and energy costs including but not limited to coffee butter wheat soybean oil pork beef diesel fuel gasoline and natural gas changes in the values of these derivatives may be recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings included in our consolidated financial statements 

certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and other general macroeconomic factors including unemployment energy prices and interest rates that are largely beyond our control may adversely affect consumer behavior and our results of operations 

our business results depend on a number of industryspecific and general economic factors many of which are beyond our control the fullservice dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in international national regional and local economic conditions seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant brands the performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends severe weather including hurricanes traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants 

general economic conditions may also adversely affect our results of operations recessionary economic cycles a protracted economic slowdown a worsening economy increased unemployment increased energy prices rising interest rates a downgrade of the us government’s longterm credit rating the european debt crisis or other industrywide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings job losses foreclosures bankruptcies and falling home prices could cause guests to make fewer discretionary purchases and any significant decrease in our guest traffic or average profit per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance in addition if gasoline natural gas electricity and other energy costs increase and credit card home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine out may spend less on each dining out occasion or may choose more inexpensive restaurants 

furthermore we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts terrorist attacks efforts to combat terrorism heightened security requirements or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems could have on our operations the economy or consumer confidence generally any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures 

unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our guests could increase our costs reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact consumer spending patterns affect the availability and cost of credit and increase pension plan expenses 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control turmoil in global credit markets could adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future there can be no assurances that we will be able to arrange credit on terms we believe are acceptable or that permit us to finance our business with historical margins a lack of credit could have an adverse impact on certain of our suppliers landlords and other tenants in retail centers in which we are located if these issues occur they could negatively affect our financial results any new disruptions in the financial markets may also adversely affect the us and world economy which could negatively impact consumer spending patterns changes in the capital markets could also have significant effects on our pension plan our pension income or expense is affected by factors including the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for the pension plan for some of our employees the weighted average asset allocation and longterm rate of return of our pension plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the interest cost component of our net periodic pension cost if our pension plan assets do not achieve positive rates of return or if our estimates and assumed rates are not accurate our earnings may decrease because net periodic pension costs would rise and we could be required to provide additional funds to cover our obligations to employees under the pension plan 

we face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees and licensees 

certain of our domestic and all of our international locations are operated by franchisees or licensees we believe that we have selected highcaliber operating partners and franchisees with significant experience in restaurant operations and are providing them with training and support however the probability of opening ultimate success and quality of any franchise or licensed restaurant rests principally with the franchisee or licensee if the franchisee or licensee does not successfully open and operate its restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards or guests have negative experiences due to issues with food quality or operational execution our brand values could suffer which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we face a variety of risks associated with doing business with business partners and vendors in foreign markets 

we are making efforts to expand our brands overseas through licensing and franchising relationships there is no assurance that international operations will be profitable or that international growth will continue our international operations are subject to all of the same risks associated with our domestic operations as well as a number of additional risks these include among other things international economic and political conditions foreign currency fluctuations and differing cultures and consumer preferences in addition expansion into international markets could create risks to our brands and reputation 

we also are subject to governmental regulations throughout the world that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors these include antitrust and tax requirements antiboycott regulations importexportcustoms regulations and other international trade regulations the usa patriot act the foreign corrupt practices act and applicable local law failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business 

we regard our olive garden ®  longhorn steakhouse ®  cheddar’s scratch kitchen ®  the capital grille ®  yard house ®  bahama breeze ®  seasons 52 ®  eddie v’s prime seafood ®  wildfish seafood grille ®  darden ® and darden restaurants ®  service marks and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts copyrights patents trademarks service marks and other common law rights such as trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our restaurants and services from infringement we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the united states and foreign jurisdictions however we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other persons although our policy is to oppose any such infringement further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources 

impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment of goodwill exists factors may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and slower growth rates any adverse change in these factors would have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations we compute the amount of impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we are required to record a noncash impairment charge if the testing performed indicates that goodwill has been impaired 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets primarily the longhorn steakhouse ®  cheddar’s scratch kitchen ®  the capital grille ®  yard house ® and eddie v’s prime seafood ®  trademarks to determine if they are definite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

as with goodwill we test our indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable we cannot accurately 

predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

failure of our internal controls over financial reporting and future changes in accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results affect our reported results of operations or otherwise harm our business and financial results 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud our growth and acquisition of other restaurant companies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud a significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation 

a change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future changes to existing accounting rules or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our reported financial results additionally our assumptions estimates and judgments related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including but not limited to revenue recognition fair value of investments impairment of longlived assets leases and related economic transactions derivatives pension and postretirement benefits intangibles selfinsurance income taxes property and equipment unclaimed property laws and litigation and stockbased compensation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by us changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend this discussion and analysis below for darden restaurants inc darden the company we us or our should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related financial statement notes included in part ii of this report under the caption “item 8  financial statements and supplementary data” we operate on a 5253week fiscal year which ends on the last sunday in may fiscal 2017  which ended may 28 2017  consisted of 52 weeks fiscal 2016  which ended may 29 2016  consisted of 52 weeks and fiscal 2015  which ended may 31 2015  consisted of 53 weeks 

overview of operations 

our business operates in the fullservice dining segment of the restaurant industry at may 28 2017  we operated 1695  restaurants through subsidiaries in the united states and canada under the olive garden ®  longhorn steakhouse ®  cheddar’s scratch kitchen ®  the capital grille ®  yard house ®  bahama breeze ®  seasons 52 ®  and eddie v’s prime seafood ® and wildfish seafood grille ® collectively eddie v’s trademarks we own and operate all of our restaurants in the united states and canada except for 9  joint venture restaurants managed by us and 45  franchised restaurants we also have 33  franchised restaurants in operation located in latin america the middle east and malaysia all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

on april 24 2017 we completed the acquisition of cheddar’s scratch kitchen for 7990 million  in total consideration the acquired operations of cheddar’s scratch kitchen included 140 companyowned restaurants and 25 franchised restaurants the results of operations financial position and cash flows of cheddar’s scratch kitchen are included in our consolidated financial statements as of the date of acquisition see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report for further details 

we believe that capable operators of strong multiunit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the restaurant industry’s fullservice segment generally the restaurant industry is considered to be comprised of three segments quick service fast casual and full service all of our restaurants fall within the fullservice segment which is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains we believe we have strong brands and that the breadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the fullservice segment of the restaurant industry this collective capability is the product of investments over many years in areas that are critical to success in our business including restaurant operations excellence brand management excellence supply chain talent management and information technology among other things 

with a focus on growing samerestaurant sales we’ve implemented a “backtobasics” approach rooted in strong operating fundamentals we’re focused on improving culinary innovation and execution inside each of our brands delivering attentive service to each and every one of our guests and creating an inviting and engaging atmosphere inside our restaurants we support these priorities with smart and relevant integrated marketing programs that resonate with our guests by delivering on these operational and brandbuilding imperatives we expect to increase our market share through new restaurant and samerestaurant sales growth and deliver bestinclass profitability 

the darden support structure enables our brands to achieve their ultimate potential by 1 driving advantages in supply chain and general and administrative support 2 applying insights collected from our significant guest and transactional databases to enhance guest relationships and identify new opportunities to drive sales growth and 3 relentlessly driving operating efficiencies and continuous improvement operating with a sense of urgency and inspiring a performancedriven culture 

we seek to increase profits by leveraging our fixed and semifixed costs with sales from new restaurants and increased guest traffic and sales at existing restaurants to evaluate our operations and assess our financial performance we monitor a number of operating measures with a special focus on two key factors 

  

 increasing samerestaurant sales can improve segment profit because these incremental sales provide better leverage of our fixed and semifixed restaurantlevel costs a restaurant brand can generate samerestaurant sales increases through increases in guest traffic increases in the average guest check or a combination of the two the average guest check can be impacted by menu price changes and by the mix of menu items sold for each restaurant brand we gather daily sales data and regularly analyze the guest traffic counts and the mix of menu items sold to aid in developing menu pricing product offerings and promotional strategies we focus on balancing our pricing and product offerings with other initiatives to produce sustainable samerestaurant sales growth we compute samerestaurant sales using restaurants open at least 16 months because this period is generally 

required for new restaurant sales levels to normalize sales at newly opened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation due to operating inefficiencies our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of new restaurant openings and closings and relocations and remodeling of existing restaurants preopening expenses each period reflect the costs associated with opening new restaurants in current and future periods 

fiscal 2017 financial highlights 

our sales from continuing operations were 717 billion  in fiscal 2017  compared to 693 billion  in fiscal 2016  the 34 percent  increase in sales from continuing operations was driven by a combined darden samerestaurant sales increase of 18 percent  excluding cheddar’s scratch kitchen and the addition of 19  net new companyowned restaurants plus the addition of 140 cheddar’s scratch kitchen purchased restaurants 

net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2017  were 4825 million   383  per diluted share compared with net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2016  of 3597 million   278  per diluted share net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2017  increased 341 percent  and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 378 percent  compared with fiscal 2016  

our net loss from discontinued operations was 34 million   003  per diluted share for fiscal 2017  compared with net earnings from discontinued operations of 153 million   012  per diluted share for fiscal 2016  when combined with results from continuing operations our diluted net earnings per share were 380  and 290  for fiscal 2017  and 2016  respectively 

outlook 

we expect combined darden samerestaurant sales to increase in fiscal 2018  between 10 percent and 20 percent and we expect fiscal 2018  sales from continuing operations to increase between 115 percent and 130 percent including cheddar’s scratch kitchen in fiscal 2018  we expect to open approximately 35 to 40 new restaurants including cheddar’s scratch kitchen and we expect capital expenditures incurred to build new restaurants remodel and maintain existing restaurants and technology initiatives to be between 4000 million and 4500 million 

in june 2017  we announced a quarterly dividend of 063  per share payable on august 1 2017  based on the 063  quarterly dividend declaration our expected annual dividend is 252  per share which reflects an increase of 125 percent  compared to our fiscal 2017  annual dividend dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors and accordingly the timing and amount of our dividends are subject to change 

there are significant risks and challenges that could impact our operations and ability to increase sales and earnings the restaurant industry is intensely competitive and sensitive to economic cycles and other business factors including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits other risks and uncertainties are discussed in part i item 1a of this report

in total the capital grille bahama breeze seasons 52 eddie v’s yard house and cheddar’s scratch kitchen generated sales in fiscal 2017  and 2016  that were 67 percent  and 53 percent  above fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015  respectively the sales increase for fiscal 2017  was primarily driven by the cheddar’s scratch kitchen acquisition and the incremental sales from new yard house restaurants sales growth also reflected samerestaurant sales increases at the capital grille bahama breeze and eddie v’s in fiscal 2017  partially offset by a samerestaurant sales decrease at yard house the sales increase for fiscal 2016  was 

primarily driven by incremental sales from new yard house restaurants and samerestaurant sales increases at all five brands partially offset by the impact of the 53 rd  week in fiscal 2015  

costs and expenses 

the following table sets forth selected operating data as a percent of sales from continuing operations for the periods indicated this information is derived from the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal years ended may 28 2017  may 29 2016  and may 31 2015  

total operating costs and expenses from continuing operations were 649 billion  in fiscal 2017  631 billion  in fiscal 2016  and 640 billion  in fiscal 2015  as a percent of sales total costs and expenses from continuing operations were 906 percent  in fiscal 2017  910 percent  in fiscal 2016  and 946 percent  in fiscal 2015  

fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  

 

fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  

 interest expense 

net interest expense decreased as a percent of sales in fiscal 2017  primarily due to debt retirement costs of 1068 million  recorded in fiscal 2016  and lower average debt balances in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016 due to the repayment of debt with proceeds from the real estate transactions and additional cash on hand net interest expense decreased as a percent of sales in fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower average debt balances in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 related to the retirement of 103 billion in principal of longterm debt in fiscal 2016 the decrease was partially offset by higher debt retirement costs of 1068 million in fiscal 2016 compared to debt retirement costs of 913 million in fiscal 2015 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  for continuing operations were 243 percent  200 percent  and 120 percent  respectively the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  and for fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  was primarily due to higher earnings before income taxes our effective tax rate from continuing operations was negative in fiscal 2015 primarily due to the impact of certain tax credits on lower earnings before income taxes driven primarily by costs incurred related to our strategic action plan 

net earnings and net earnings per share from continuing operations 

net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2017  were 4825 million   383  per diluted share compared with net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2016  of 3597 million   278  per diluted share and net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2015  of 1964 million   151  per diluted share 

net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2017  increased 341 percent  and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 378 percent  compared with fiscal 2016  primarily due to increased sales lower food and beverage costs marketing expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expenses and impairments and disposal of assets net as a percent of sales partially offset by higher restaurant expenses as a percent of sales and a higher effective income tax rate our diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2017  were adversely impacted by approximately 010 due to a noncash pension settlement charge and approximately 009 related to the acquisition and integration of cheddar’s scratch kitchen 

net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2016  increased 831 percent  and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 841 percent  compared with fiscal 2015  primarily due to increased sales lower food and beverage costs marketing expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expenses and impairments and disposal of assets net as a percent of sales partially offset by higher restaurant expenses as a percent of sales and a higher effective income tax rate our diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2016  were adversely impacted by approximately 051 due to debt retirement costs and approximately 026 related to the real estate plan implementation and positively impacted by approximately 002 due to a tax benefit associated with the prior year lobster aquaculture divestiture 

earnings loss from discontinued operations 

on an aftertax basis results from discontinued operations for fiscal 2017  were a net loss of 34 million   003  per diluted share compared with earnings from discontinued operations for fiscal 2016  of 153 million   012  per diluted share and fiscal 2015  of 5131 million   396  per diluted share earnings from discontinued operations reflects pretax gains of 179 million recorded in fiscal 2016  and 8370 million in fiscal 2015  related to the sale of red lobster 

segment results 

we manage our restaurant brands olive garden longhorn steakhouse cheddar’s scratch kitchen the capital grille yard house bahama breeze seasons 52 and eddie v’s in north america as operating segments we aggregate our operating segments into reportable segments based on a combination of the size economic characteristics and subsegment of fullservice dining within which each brand operates our four reportable segments are 1 olive garden 2 longhorn steakhouse 3 fine dining and 4 other business see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report for further details 

our management uses segment profit as the measure for assessing performance of our segments the following table presents segment profit margin for the periods indicated 

the decrease in olive garden’s segment profit margin for fiscal 2017  was driven primarily by additional rent expense resulting from the real estate transactions the growth in olive garden’s segment profit margin for fiscal 2016  was driven primarily by leveraging positive samerestaurant sales food and beverage cost favorability and cost reduction initiatives partially offset by additional rent expense resulting from real estate transactions longhorn’s segment profit margins for fiscal 2017  were flat as additional rent expense resulting from the real estate transactions was offset by food cost deflation the growth in longhorn’s segment profit margins for fiscal 2016  was driven primarily by leveraging positive samerestaurant sales as well as improved cost of sales and lower marketing expense partially offset by additional rent expense resulting from real estate transactions the growth in fine dining’s segment profit margins for fiscal 2017  was driven primarily by food cost deflation primarily beef partially offset by higher restaurant expenses the growth in fine dining’s segment profit margins for fiscal 2016  was driven primarily by improved food and beverage costs the other business segment profit margins for fiscal 2017  were flat as food cost deflation was offset by higher labor costs the growth for fiscal 2016  was driven by positive samerestaurant sales leverage and lower food and beverage costs 

seasonality 

our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally typically our average sales per restaurant are highest in the winter and spring followed by the summer and lowest in the fall holidays changes in the economy severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions because of the seasonality of our business results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

impact of inflation 

we attempt to minimize the annual effects of inflation through appropriate planning operating practices and menu price increases we do not believe inflation had a significant overall effect on our annual results of operations during fiscal 2017  or fiscal 2016  we experienced higher than normal inflationary costs during fiscal 2015  and were able to partially reduce the annual impact utilizing these strategies 

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions we consider the following estimates to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

leases 

we evaluate our leases at their inception to estimate their expected term which commences on the date when we have the right to control the use of the leased property and includes the noncancelable base term plus all option periods we are reasonably assured to exercise our judgment in determining the appropriate expected term for each lease affects our evaluation of 

 these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different expected lease terms were used 

valuation of longlived assets 

land buildings and equipment and certain other assets including definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the judgments we make related to the expected useful lives of longlived assets definitions of lease terms and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of these assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets changes in economic conditions changes in usage or operating performance desirability of the restaurant sites and other factors such as our ability to sell our assets held for sale as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our longlived assets significant adverse changes in these factors could cause us to realize an impairment loss based on a review of operating results for each of our restaurants the amount of net book value associated with lower performing restaurants that would be deemed at risk for impairment is not material to our consolidated financial statements 

valuation and recoverability of goodwill and trademarks 

goodwill and trademarks are not subject to amortization and have been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing the reporting units are our restaurant brands at may 28 2017  we had the following amounts recorded as goodwill and trademarks at our brands 



a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and slower growth rates any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

we performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill and trademarks as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter using a qualitative assessment in considering the qualitative approach we evaluated factors including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions market and industry conditions commodity cost fluctuations competitive environment share price performance results of prior impairment tests operational stability and the overall financial performance of the reporting units based on the results of our qualitative assessment no impairment of goodwill or trademarks was indicated changes in circumstances existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future or in the numerous estimates associated with management’s judgments and assumptions made in assessing the fair value of our goodwill and trademarks could result in an impairment loss of a portion or all of our goodwill or trademarks due to the proximity of the acquisition to our fiscal 2017 year end the preliminary estimates for goodwill and trademark related to cheddar’s scratch kitchen were not included in our qualitative assessment 

if our annual test resulted in an impairment of our goodwill or trademarks our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected and our leverage ratio for purposes of our credit agreement would increase a leverage ratio exceeding the maximum permitted under our credit agreement would be a default under our credit agreement at may 28 2017  a writedown of goodwill other indefinitelived intangible assets or any other assets in excess of approximately 108 billion would have been required to cause our leverage ratio to exceed the permitted maximum as our leverage ratio is determined on a quarterly basis and due to the seasonal nature of our business a lesser amount of impairment in future quarters could cause our leverage ratio to exceed the permitted maximum 

unearned revenues 

unearned revenues represent our liability for gift cards that have been sold but not yet redeemed the estimated value of gift cards expected to remain unused is recognized over the expected period of redemption as the remaining gift card values are redeemed generally over a period of 10 years utilizing this method we estimate both the amount of breakage and the time period of redemption if actual redemption patterns vary from our estimates actual gift card breakage income may differ from the amounts recorded we update our estimates of our redemption period and our breakage rate periodically and apply that rate to gift card redemptions changing our breakagerate assumption on unredeemed gift cards by 25 basis points would result in an adjustment in our unearned revenues of approximately 210 million 

income taxes 

we estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes these estimates include among other items depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported employee tip income effective rates for state and local income taxes and the tax deductibility of certain other items we adjust our annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available 

assessment of uncertain tax positions requires judgments relating to the amounts timing and likelihood of resolution as described in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report the 164 million  balance of unrecognized tax benefits at may 28 2017  includes 07 million  related to tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts could change during the next 12 months based on the outcome of examinations the 07 million  relates to items that would impact our effective income tax rate 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows generated from operating activities are our principal source of liquidity which we use to finance capital expenditures for new restaurants and to remodel and maintain existing restaurants to pay dividends to our shareholders and to repurchase shares of our common stock since substantially all of our sales are for cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable are generally due in 5 to 45 days we are able to carry current liabilities in excess of current assets in addition to cash flows from operations we use a combination of longterm and shortterm borrowings to fund our capital needs 

we currently manage our business and financial ratios to target an investmentgrade bond rating which has historically allowed flexible access to financing at reasonable costs currently our publicly issued longterm debt carries “baa3” moody’s investors service “bbb” standard  poor’s and “bbb” fitch ratings our commercial paper has ratings of “p3” moody’s investors service “a2” standard  poor’s and “f2” fitch these ratings are as of the date of the filing of this report and have been obtained with the understanding that moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch will continue to monitor our credit and make future adjustments to these ratings to the extent warranted the ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our securities may be changed superseded or withdrawn at any time and should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

on april 10 2017  we issued 5000 million  aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3850 percent  senior notes due may 2027  under a registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on october 6 2016 discount and issuance costs which totaled 44 million  are being amortized over the term of the notes using the straightline method the results of which approximate the effective interest method interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on may 1 and november 1 of each year commencing november 1 2017 we may redeem the notes at any time in whole or from time to time in part at the principal amount plus a makewhole premium if we experience a change in control triggering event unless we have previously exercised our right to redeem the notes we may be required to purchase the notes from the holders at a purchase price equal to 101 percent  of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 

we maintain a 7500 million  revolving credit agreement revolving credit agreement with bank of america na boa as administrative agent and the lenders and other agents party thereto the revolving credit agreement is a senior unsecured credit commitment to the company and contains customary representations and affirmative and negative covenants including limitations on liens and subsidiary debt and a maximum consolidated lease adjusted total debt to total capitalization ratio of 075  to 100 and events of default usual for credit facilities of this type as of may 28 2017  we were in compliance with all covenants under the revolving credit agreement 

the revolving credit agreement matures on october 24 2018  and the proceeds may be used for commercial paper backup working capital and capital expenditures the refinancing of certain indebtedness certain acquisitions and general corporate purposes loans under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at a rate of libor plus a margin determined by reference to a ratingsbased pricing grid applicable margin or the base rate which is defined as the highest of the boa prime rate the federal funds rate plus 0500 percent  and the eurocurrency rate plus 100 percent  plus the applicable margin assuming a “bbb” equivalent credit rating level the applicable margin under the revolving credit agreement will be 1100 percent  for libor loans and 0100 percent  for base rate loans as of may 28 2017  we had no  outstanding balances under the revolving credit agreement 

at may 28 2017  our longterm debt consisted principally of 

 the interest rate on our 3000 million   6800 percent  senior notes due october 2037  is subject to adjustment from time to time if the debt rating assigned to such series of notes is downgraded below a certain rating level or subsequently upgraded the maximum adjustment is 2000 percent  above the initial interest rate and the interest rate cannot be reduced below the initial interest rate as of may 28 2017  no such adjustments are made to this rate 

through our shelf registration statement on file with the sec depending on conditions prevailing in the public capital markets we may issue unsecured debt securities from time to time in one or more series which may consist of notes debentures or other evidences of indebtedness in one or more offerings 

from time to time we may repurchase our outstanding debt in privately negotiated transactions such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements and other factors 

from time to time we enter into interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk inherent in our operations see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report 

a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at may 28 2017  is as follows 



 

our fixedcharge coverage ratio which measures the number of times each year that we earn enough to cover our fixed charges amounted to 50  times and 27  times on a continuing operations basis for the fiscal years ended may 28 2017  and may 29 2016  respectively our adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio which includes 625  times the total annual minimum rent on a consolidated basis of  3035 million  and  2485 million  for the fiscal years ended may 28 2017  and may 29 2016  respectively as components of adjusted debt and adjusted total capital was 59 percent  and 53 percent  as of may 28 2017  and may 29 2016  respectively we include the leasedebt equivalent and contractual lease guarantees in our adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio reported to shareholders as we believe its inclusion better represents the optimal capital structure that we target from period to period and because it is consistent with the calculation of the covenant under our revolving credit agreement 

based on these ratios we believe our financial condition is strong the composition of our capital structure is shown in the following table 



net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations were 9182 million  8204 million  and 8743 million  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively net cash flows provided by operating activities include net earnings from continuing operations of 4825 million  3597 million  and 1964 million  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased in fiscal 2017  primarily due to higher net earnings from continuing operations partially offset by the timing of payments of accounts payable and current period activity of taxable timing differences net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased in fiscal 2016  primarily due to current period activity of taxable timing differences and the timing of inventory purchases offset by higher net earnings from continuing operations 

net cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations were 107 billion  in fiscal 2017  compared to net cash flows provided by investing activities from continuing operations of 754 million  in fiscal 2016  and net cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations of 2351 million  in fiscal 2015  capital expenditures incurred principally for building new restaurants remodeling existing restaurants replacing equipment and technology initiatives were 2930 million  in fiscal 2017  compared to 2283 million  in fiscal 2016  and 2965 million  in fiscal 2015  additionally for fiscal 2017  net cash used in the acquisition of cheddar’s scratch kitchen was 7644 million  for fiscal 2016  proceeds from the disposal of land buildings and equipment of 3252 million  reflect the impact of closed saleleaseback transactions 

net cash flows provided by financing activities from continuing operations were 1292 million  in fiscal 2017  compared to net cash flows used in financing activities from continuing operations of 112 billion  in fiscal 2016  and 178 billion  in fiscal 2015  net cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal 2017  reflect proceeds from the issuance of 5000 million  of senior notes and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options partially offset by dividend payments of 2791 million  and share repurchases of 2302 million  net cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2016  reflected longterm debt payments of 110 billion  including repurchase premiums and makewhole provisions dividend payments of 2682 million  and share repurchases of 1848 million  partially offset by the 3150 million  cash dividend received by us from four corners and proceeds 

from the exercise of employee stock options net cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2015  included longterm debt payments of 107 billion  including repurchase premiums and makewhole provisions dividend payments of 2789 million  and share repurchases of 5023 million  and net repayments of shortterm debt 2076 million  partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 

our defined benefit and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are determined using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies prescribed under financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic 715 compensation  retirement benefits and topic 712 compensation  nonretirement postemployment benefits we use certain assumptions including but not limited to the selection of a discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we set the discount rate assumption annually for each plan at its valuation date to reflect the yield of highquality fixedincome debt instruments with lives that approximate the maturity of the plan benefits at may 28 2017  our discount rate was 406 percent  and 398 percent  respectively for our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based upon several factors including our historical assumptions compared with actual results an analysis of current market conditions asset allocations and the views of leading financial advisers and economists our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for our defined benefit plans was 65  percent for fiscal year 2017  65  percent for fiscal year 2016  and 70 percent  for fiscal year 2015  we made defined benefit plans contributions of approximately 04 million  254 million  and 04 million  in fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively we expect to contribute approximately 04 million  to our defined benefit pension plans and approximately 13 million  to our postretirement benefit plan during fiscal 2018  

we have recognized net losses of 701 million  net of tax and of 03 million  net of tax as components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the defined benefit plans and postretirement benefit plan respectively as of may 28 2017  these net losses represent changes in the amount of the projected benefit obligation and plan assets resulting from differences in the assumptions used and actual experience the amortization of the net loss component of our fiscal 2018  net periodic benefit cost for the defined benefit plans is expected to be approximately 17 million net of tax the amortization of the net gain component of our fiscal 2018  net periodic benefit cost for the postretirement benefit plan is expected to be approximately 19 million net of tax 

we believe our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the factors discussed above however other assumptions could also be reasonably applied that could differ from the assumptions used these changes in assumptions would not significantly impact our funding requirements 

we are not aware of any trends or events that would materially affect our capital requirements or liquidity we believe that our internal cashgenerating capabilities the potential issuance of unsecured debt securities under our shelf registration statement and shortterm commercial paper should be sufficient to finance our capital expenditures debt maturities stock repurchase program and other operating activities through fiscal 2018  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are not a party to any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition sales or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

financial condition 

our total current assets were 7998 million  at may 28 2017  compared with 8203 million  at may 29 2016  the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents driven by the acquisition of cheddar’s scratch kitchen 

our total current liabilities were 129 billion  at may 28 2017  compared with 119 billion  at may 29 2016  the increase was primarily due to an increase in unearned revenues associated with gift card sales in excess of redemptions 

application of new accounting standards 

see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates compensation and commodity prices to manage this exposure we periodically enter into interest rate and foreign currency exchange instruments equity forward and commodity derivative instruments for other than trading purposes see notes 1 and 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 of this report 

we use the variancecovariance method to measure value at risk over time horizons ranging from one week to one year at the 95 percent confidence level at may 28 2017  our potential losses in future net earnings resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rate instruments commodity instruments equity forwards and floatingrate debt interest rate exposures were approximately 300 million over a period of one year the value at risk from an increase in the fair value of all of our longterm fixedrate debt over a period of one year was approximately 1003 million the fair value of our longterm fixedrate debt outstanding as of may 28 2017  averaged 5743 million with a high of 106 billion and a low of 4926 million during fiscal 2017  our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows by targeting an appropriate mix of variable and fixedrate debt

strategy 

we believe that capable operators of strong multiunit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the restaurant industry’s fullservice segment generally the restaurant industry is considered to be comprised of three segments quick service fast casual and full service all of our restaurants fall within the fullservice segment which is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains we believe we have strong brands and that the breadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the fullservice restaurant industry this collective capability is the product of investments over many years in areas that are critical to success in our business including restaurant operations excellence brand management excellence supply chain talent management and information technology among other things 

during fiscal 2016 our operating philosophy was focused on improving the core operational fundamentals of the business by providing an outstanding guest experience rooted in culinary innovation attentive service engaging atmosphere and integrated marketing darden enables each brand to reach its full potential by leveraging its scale insight and experience in a way that protects uniqueness and competitive advantages additionally brands can capitalize on insights to deliver customized onetoone customer relationship marketing we hold ourselves accountable for operating our restaurants with a sense of urgency to achieve our commitments to all of our stakeholders 

recent and planned restaurant growth 

during fiscal 2016  we added 2  net new companyowned restaurants in the united states our fiscal 2016  actual restaurant openings and closings fiscal 2017 projected openings and approximate capital investment square footage and dining capacity by brand are shown below 



 

the actual number of openings for each of our brands for fiscal 2017 will depend on many factors including our ability to locate appropriate sites negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms obtain necessary local governmental permits complete construction and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel our objective is to continue to expand all of our restaurant brands 

we consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant’s longterm success and we devote significant effort to the site selection process prior to entering a market we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors these factors include trade area demographics such as target population density and household income levels competitive influences in the trade area the site’s visibility accessibility and traffic volume and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls hotelmotel complexes offices and universities members of senior management evaluate inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after permits are obtained and the site is acquired 

we systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards when a restaurant falls below minimum standards we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes and implement marketing and operational plans to improve that restaurant’s performance if performance does not improve to acceptable levels the restaurant is evaluated for relocation closing or conversion to one of our other brands permanent closures are typically due to economic changes in trade areas the expiration of lease agreements or site concerns accordingly we continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges 

restaurant operations 

we believe that highquality restaurant management is critical to our longterm success our restaurant management structure varies by brand and restaurant size we issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards 

each olive garden restaurant is led by a general manager and each longhorn steakhouse restaurant is led by a managing partner each also has two to five additional managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant in addition each restaurant typically employs an average of 50 to 120 hourly team members most of whom work parttime restaurant general managers or managing partners report to a director of operations who is responsible for approximately six to ten restaurants each director of operations of olive garden and longhorn steakhouse reports to a senior vice president of operations who is responsible for up to one hundred restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by operations management including officer level executives to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards 

each bahama breeze and yard house restaurant is led by a general manager and each the capital grille seasons 52 and eddie vs restaurant is led by a managing partner each also has two to eight managers each the capital grille seasons 52 and eddie vs restaurant has one to three executive chefs and each bahama breeze and yard house restaurant has one to three culinary managers in addition each restaurant typically employs an average of 65 to 150 hourly team members most of whom work parttime the general manager or managing partner of each restaurant reports directly to a director of operations who has operational responsibility for approximately three to ten restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by operations management including officer level executives to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards 

our learning and employee development team in partnership with each brand’s training leader together with senior operations executives is responsible for developing and maintaining our operations training programs these efforts include a 10 to 12week training program for management trainees seven to nine weeks in the case of internal promotions and continuing development programs for all levels of leadership the emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant brand but includes leadership restaurant business management and culinary skills we also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants including deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations the opening training teams typically begin work one and a half weeks prior to opening and remain at the new restaurant for up to three weeks after the opening they are redeployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant’s operating staff 

we maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our managementlevel team members we believe that our leadership position strong resultsoriented culture and various shortterm and longterm incentive programs including stockbased compensation enhances our ability to attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers 

quality assurance 

our total quality department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe highquality food in a clean and safe environment through rigorous supplier and risk based product evaluations we purchase only products that meet or exceed our product specifications we rely on independent third parties to inspect and evaluate our suppliers and distributors suppliers that produce “highrisk” products are subject to a food safety evaluation by darden personnel at least annually we require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive hazard analysis and critical control point “haccp” food safety programs and risk based preventative controls adopted by the us food and drug administration these programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause foodborne illnesses by applying scientificallybased controls to analyze hazards identify and monitor critical control points and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met we require routine food safety verification for high risk products from our suppliers our total quality managers and third party auditors visit each restaurant regularly throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation the total quality managers also serve as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety 

purchasing and distribution 

our ability to ensure a consistent supply of safe highquality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant brands depends on reliable sources of procurement our purchasing staff sources negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 1500 suppliers whose products originate in more than 35 countries suppliers must meet our requirements and strict quality control standards in the development harvest catch and production of food products competitive bids longterm contracts and strategic supplier relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products 

we believe that our significant scale is a competitive advantage and our purchasing team leverages this purchasing capability our purchasing staff travels routinely within the united states and internationally to source topquality food products at competitive prices we believe that we have established excellent longterm relationships with key suppliers and usually source our product directly from producers not brokers or middlemen we actively support several national minority supplier organizations to ensure that darden incorporates women and minorityowned businesses in all of its purchasing decisions 

we continue to drive automation of our supply chain by working with our suppliers logistics partners and distributors to improve optimization with information visibility through our subsidiary darden direct distribution inc darden direct and longterm agreements with our third party national distribution companies we maintain inventory ownership of food and supplies in warehouses primarily dedicated to darden where practical to do so darden direct further enables our purchasing staff to integrate demand forecasts into longterm agreements driving efficiencies in production economics when we collaborate with vendors because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales 

advertising and marketing 

integrated marketing is a key element of our strategy and our scale enables us to be a leading advertiser in the fullservice dining segment of the restaurant industry olive garden leverages the efficiency of national network television advertising olive garden supplements this with cable local television and digital advertising longhorn steakhouse uses local television and digital advertising to build engagement and loyalty by market the capital grille yard house bahama breeze seasons 52 and eddie vs do not use television advertising but rely on local and digital marketing our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to build awareness and strengthen our brands we implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase our sales and profits as well as increase frequency of visitation by our guests we also rely on outdoor billboard direct mail and email advertising as well as radio newspapers digital coupons search engine marketing and social media such as facebook® and twitter® as appropriate to attract engage and retain our guests we have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor guest satisfaction and evolving food service trends and expectations 

in fiscal 2016 we continued a multiyear effort to implement new technology platforms that allow us to digitally engage with our guests and team members and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities in this increasingly connected society we also developed and deployed a new online and mobile ordering system for olive garden which was implemented nationwide in addition we rolled out tabletop tablets to improve the guest experience in all olive garden restaurants during fiscal 2016 we continued exploring brand loyalty and customer relationship management programs for our brands to increase the frequency of visits and offer our guests flexibility when making dining out decisions as we implement new platforms we are integrating them into all guest touch points including restaurant operating systems to enable compelling personalized guest experiences 

  in fiscal 2016 olive garden continued to develop spanish language advertising to increase awareness and visits from hispanic consumers

information technology 

we strive for leadership in the restaurant business by using technology as a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy we have implemented technologyenabled business solutions targeted at improved financial control cost management guest service and employee effectiveness these solutions are designed to be used across restaurant brands yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant brand our strategy is to fully integrate systems to drive operational efficiencies and enable restaurant teams to focus on restaurant operations excellence 

restaurant hardware and software support for all of our restaurant brands is provided or coordinated from the restaurant support center facility in orlando florida a highspeed data network sends and receives critical business data to and from the restaurants throughout the day and night providing timely and extensive information on business activity in every location our data center contains sufficient computing power to process information from all restaurants quickly and efficiently our information is processed in a secure environment to protect both the actual data and the physical assets we guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan which includes storing critical business information offsite testing the disaster recovery plan at a hostsite facility and providing onsite power backup via a large diesel generator we use internally developed proprietary software as well as purchased software with proven nonproprietary hardware this allows processing power to be distributed effectively to each of our restaurants 

our management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates will position us well to support current needs and future growth we use a strategic information systems planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic financial regulatory and other business advantage criteria 

competition 

the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food price service restaurant location personnel brand attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing the restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing restaurants and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power we compete within each market with national and regional chains and locallyowned restaurants for guests management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites we also face growing competition from the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section in addition improving product offerings at fast casual restaurants and quickservice restaurants together with negative economic conditions could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives we expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas 

other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled “purchasing and distribution” “advertising and marketing” and “information technology” in this item 1 and in our risk factors in item 1a of this form 10k

government regulation

during fiscal 2016  126 percent  of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site in most cases on an annual basis and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time these regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant operation including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours of operation advertising wholesale purchasing inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages the failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these licenses would adversely affect the restaurant’s operations we also are subject in certain states to “dramshop” statutes which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person who then causes injury to himself or a third party we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance

 item 1a risk factors 

various risks and uncertainties could affect our business any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations 

we rely heavily on information technology in our operations and insufficient guest or employee facing technology or a failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network free from material failure interruption or security breach could harm our ability to effectively operate our business andor result in the loss of respected relationships with our guests or employees 

we rely heavily on information systems across our operations including for marketing programs employee engagement management of our supply chain pointofsale processing system in our restaurants and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems in addition we must effectively respond to changing guest expectations and new technological developments disruptions failures or other performance issues with these guest facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our business and negatively affect our relationship with our guest the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems a material network breach in the security of these systems as a result of a cyber attack or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to us or an individual this could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets or the improper use of personal information or other “identity 

theft” each of these situations or data privacy breaches may cause delays in guest service reduce efficiency in our operations require significant capital investments to remediate the problem result in customer or advertiser dissatisfaction or otherwise result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation and we could be subjected to litigation regulatory investigations or the imposition of penalties as privacy and information security laws and regulations change and cyber risks evolve we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance and protect guest employee and company information 

a failure to maintain food safety throughout the supply chain and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

food safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe quality food products however food safety issues could be caused at the point of source or by food suppliers or distributors and as a result be out of our control in addition regardless of the source or cause any report of foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination at one of our restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our brands and have a negative impact on our sales even instances of foodborne illness food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients resulting in higher costs and lower margins 

litigation including allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees guests suppliers shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation these actions and proceedings may involve allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices including wage and hour violations and employment discrimination guest discrimination food safety issues including poor food quality foodborne illness food tampering food contamination and adverse health effects from consumption of various food products or highcalorie foods including obesity other personal injury violation of “dram shop” laws providing an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or a third party trademark infringement violation of the federal securities laws or other concerns the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time the cost to defend litigation may be significant there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease guest acceptance of our brands regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are found liable litigation could impact our operations in other ways as well allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices for example could adversely affect employee acquisition and retention as a result litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable publicity or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could harm our reputation and adversely impact our guest counts and sales 

the good reputation of our restaurant brands is a key factor in the success of our business actual or alleged incidents at any of our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could harm our brands even incidents occurring at restaurants operated by our competitors or in the supply chain generally could result in negative publicity that could harm the restaurant industry overall and indirectly our own brands negative publicity may result from allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices employee dissatisfaction guest discrimination illness injury or any of the other matters discussed above that could give rise to litigation regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants or only to a single restaurant could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand negative publicity also may result from health concerns including food safety and flu outbreaks publication of government or industry findings concerning food products environmental disasters crime incidents data privacy breaches scandals involving our employees or operational problems at our restaurants all of which could make our brands and menu offerings less appealing to our guests and negatively impact our guest counts and sales adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of our brands or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to a number of risks relating to public policy changes and federal state and local regulation of our business including in the areas of health care reform environmental matters minimum wage unionization data privacy menu labeling immigration requirements and taxes and an insufficient or ineffective response to government regulation may impact our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability 

the restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal state local and international laws and regulations the development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites which are subject to building zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations and requirements we are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health sanitation safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food including regulations regarding product safety nutritional content and menu labeling we are subject to federal and state laws governing minimum wages unionization and other labor issues these include the fair labor standards act of 1938 and requirements concerning overtime paid or family leave tip credits working conditions and safety standards they also include the immigration reform and control act of 1986 which requires among other things the preparation of form i9 to verify that employees are authorized to accept employment in the united states we are also reviewing the potential impacts of new laws associated with health care passed by various state and local governments 

we also are subject to federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities such as the ada compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation new or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our labor costs 

the affordable care act requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus beginning in may 2017 we do not expect to incur any material costs from compliance with this provision but cannot anticipate any changes in guest behavior resulting from the implementation of this portion of the law which could have an adverse effect on our sales or results of operations 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge emission and disposal of hazardous materials there also has been increasing focus by united states and overseas governmental authorities on other environmental matters such as climate change the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption this increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating a yet to be specified array of environmental matters such as the emission of greenhouse gases where “cap and trade” initiatives could effectively impose a tax on carbon emissions legislative regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials taxes transportation and utilities which could decrease our operating profits and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment 

we are subject to laws relating to information security privacy cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud an increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information including social security numbers financial information including credit card numbers and health information compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and any failure or perceived failure to comply with those laws or any breach of our systems could harm our reputation or lead to litigation which could adversely affect our financial condition 

the impact of current laws and regulations the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues could increase our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal state and local authorities could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings 

a majority of our restaurants are now operated in leased properties and we are committed to longterm and noncancelable leases that we may want to cancel and may be unable to renew the leases that we may want to extend at the end of their terms 

under the strategic real estate plan we pursued during fiscal 2016 we transferred the majority of our owned restaurant properties to four corners with substantially all of four corners’ initial assets being leased back to us in addition we sold and leased back 64 other real properties in individual sale leaseback transactions the initial terms for the leases for these properties average 15 years but range from 1218 years and have fixed rent escalations for the initial term and multiple renewal options at our discretion in addition to these new leases we previously leased more than 950 properties and as a result 1449 of 1536  restaurants operating in the united states and canada as of may 29 2016  are in leased locations if we close a restaurant we may remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease which would include among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term additionally the potential losses associated with our inability to cancel leases may result in our keeping open restaurant locations that are performing significantly below 

targeted levels as a result ongoing lease obligations at closed or underperforming restaurant locations could impair our results of operations in addition at the end of the lease term and expiration of all renewal periods we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost if at all as a result we may be required to close or relocate a restaurant which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks and may have an adverse effect on our operating performance 

we may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs 

our restaurant operations are subject to united states and canadian federal state and local laws governing such matters as minimum wages working conditions overtime and tip credits as federal and state minimum wage rates increase we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage labor shortages increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs this in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales conversely if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices our profitability may decline in addition the current premiums that we pay for our insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property health and directors’ and officers’ liability may increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs the dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers’ compensation and general liability insurance for which we carry high perclaim deductibles may also increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs further the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses 

our inability or failure to execute on a comprehensive business continuity plan following a major natural disaster such as a hurricane or manmade disaster including terrorism at our corporate facility could have a materially adverse impact on our business 

many of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one florida location   we have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature including hurricanes and other natural disasters and back up and offsite locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information however if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans we may experience delays in recovery of data inability to perform vital corporate functions tardiness in required reporting and compliance failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims 

health concerns arising from foodrelated pandemics outbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

the united states and other countries have experienced or may experience in the future outbreaks of viruses such as norovirus avian flu or “sars” and h1n1 or “swine flu” or other diseases to the extent that a virus or disease is foodborne or perceived to be foodborne future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product or could reduce public confidence in food handling andor public assembly for example public concern over avian flu may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry the inability to serve poultrybased products would restrict our ability to provide a variety of menu items to our guests if we change a restaurant menu in response to such concerns we may lose guests who do not prefer the new menu and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new guest base to produce the sales needed to make the restaurant profitable we also may have different or additional competitors for our intended guests as a result of such a change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors if a virus is transmitted by human contact our employees or guests could become infected or could choose or be advised to avoid gathering in public places any of which could adversely affect our restaurant guest traffic and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level we also could be adversely affected if the world health organization andor the centers for disease control were to restrict travel to affected geographic areas where we source our products thus possibly impacting the continuity of supply additionally jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition and if we have an insufficient focus on competition and the consumer landscape our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

the fullservice dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing service location personnel and type and quality of food and there are many wellestablished competitors we compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locallyowned restaurants we also face growing competition as a result of the trend 

toward convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services particularly in the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section we compete primarily on the quality variety and value perception of menu items the number and location of restaurants type of brand quality and efficiency of service attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors we anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors if we are unable to continue to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our failure to drive both shortterm and longterm profitable sales growth through brand relevance operating excellence and opening new restaurants of existing brands and developing new dining brands could result in poor financial performance 

as part of our business strategy we intend to drive profitable sales growth by increasing samerestaurant sales at existing restaurants continuing to expand our current portfolio of restaurant brands and developing additional brands that can be expanded profitably this strategy involves numerous risks and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives 

at existing brands we may not be able to maintain brand relevance and restaurant operating excellence to achieve sustainable samerestaurant sales growth and warrant new unit growth existing brand shortterm sales growth could be impacted if we are unable to drive near term guest count and sales growth and longterm sales growth could be impacted if we fail to extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to our guests a failure to innovate and extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to guests and occasions in order to generate sustainable samerestaurant traffic growth and produce nontraditional sales and earnings growth opportunities insufficient focus on our competition or failure to adequately address the decline of the casual dining industry could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition we may not be able to support sustained new unit growth or open all of our planned new restaurants and the new restaurants that we open may not be profitable or as profitable as our existing restaurants new restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize and even sales at successful newlyopened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation the opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on guest counts and sales levels at existing restaurants 

the ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations the need to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses on a timely basis the need to comply with other regulatory requirements the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay construction increases in labor and building material costs the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms changes in weather or other acts of god that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions at each potential location we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites construction contractors management personnel hourly employees and other resources if we are unable to successfully manage these risks we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated sales and earnings in future periods 

we also may not be able to identify and integrate additional brands or develop new business opportunities that are as profitable as our existing restaurants 

our plans to expand our smaller brands bahama breeze seasons 52 and eddie vs and the testing of other new business ventures that have not yet proven their longterm viability may not be successful which could require us to make substantial further investments in those brands and new business ventures and result in losses and impairments 

while each of our restaurant brands as well as each of our individual restaurants are subject to the risks and uncertainties described above there is an enhanced level of risk and uncertainty related to the operation and expansion of our smaller brands such as bahama breeze seasons 52 and eddie vs these brands and new business ventures have not yet proven their longterm viability or growth potential we have made substantial investments in the development and expansion of each of these brands and further investment is required while we have implemented a number of changes to operations at bahama breeze and believe we have improved the guest experience and unit economics sufficiently to restart modest unit growth there can be no assurance that these changes will continue to be successful or that additional new unit growth will occur eddie vs is still in the early stages of development and will require additional resources to support further growth 

in each case these brands and business initiatives will continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties that accompany any emerging restaurant brand or new business initiative 

a lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

the success of our restaurants depends in large part on their locations as demographic and economic patterns change current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations in addition desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation the occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may experience higherthananticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants we incur substantial preopening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close relocate or remodel existing restaurants the expenses of opening closing relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated an increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

a failure to identify and execute innovative marketing and guest relationship tactics ineffective or improper use of other marketing initiatives and increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

if our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions if our advertising media or marketing expenses increase or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors or if we do not adequately leverage technology and data analytic capabilities needed to generate concise competitive insight we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations a failure to sufficiently innovate develop guest relationship initiatives or maintain adequate and effective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales 

as part of our marketing efforts we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain guests these initiatives may not be successful and pose a variety of other risks as discussed below under the heading our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business 

a failure to recruit develop and retain effective leaders the loss or shortage of personnel with key capacities and skills or an inability to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction could impact our strategic direction and jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

our future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other employees our future growth also depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain highquality employees to work in and manage our restaurants we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees in order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth changes in senior management could expose us to significant changes in strategic direction and initiatives a failure to maintain appropriate organizational capacity and capability to support leadership excellence adequate resources innovative skill sets and expectations and build adequate bench strength required for growth a loss of key employees or a significant shortage of highquality restaurant employees and an inability to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction could lead to poor guest satisfaction higher turnover litigation and unionization which could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

a failure to address cost pressures including rising costs for commodities labor health care and utilities used by our restaurants and a failure to effectively deliver cost management activities and achieve economies of scale in purchasing could compress our margins and adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food ingredients labor health care utilities and other related costs over which we may have little control operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities including shrimp lobster crab and other seafood as well as beef pork chicken cheese and produce the introduction of or changes to tariffs on imported food products such as shrimp could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products we cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results we attempt to leverage our size to achieve economies of scale in purchasing but there can be no assurances that we can always do so effectively we are subject to the general risks of inflation 

increases in minimum wage health care and other benefit costs may have a material adverse effect on our labor costs we operate in many states and localities where the minimum wage is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage increases in minimum wage may also result in increases in the wage rates paid for nonminimum wage positions 

our restaurants’ operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as electricity and natural gas whether as a result of inflation or otherwise on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply in addition interruptions to the availability of gas electric water or other utilities whether due to aging infrastructure weather conditions fire animal damage trees digging accidents or other reasons largely out of our control may adversely affect our operations our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may lose sales or incur increased costs if our restaurants experience shortages or interruptions in the delivery of food and other products from our third party vendors and suppliers 

shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants may be caused by inclement weather natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods droughts and earthquakes the inability of our vendors to obtain credit in a tightened credit market or remain solvent given disruptions in the financial markets or other conditions beyond our control such shortages or interruptions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants we may have a limited number of suppliers for certain of our products supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our restaurant operations if we raise prices as a result of increased food costs or shortages it may negatively impact our sales if we temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular items from a restaurant’s menu that restaurant may experience a significant reduction in sales during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our guests changing their dining habits 

adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could adversely affect our restaurant sales 

adverse weather conditions can impact guest traffic at our restaurants cause the temporary underutilization of outdoor patio seating and in more severe cases such as hurricanes tornadoes or other natural disasters cause temporary closures sometimes for prolonged periods which would negatively impact our restaurant sales changes in weather could result in construction delays interruptions to the availability of utilities and shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies which could increase our costs some climatologists predict that the longterm effects of climate change and global warming may result in more severe volatile weather or extended droughts which could increase the frequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to hedge exposures to fluctuations in commodity and broader market prices may cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we use or may use derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our principal ingredient labor and energy costs including but not limited to coffee butter wheat soybean oil pork beef diesel fuel gasoline and natural gas changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings included in our consolidated financial statements 

certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and other general macroeconomic factors including unemployment energy prices and interest rates that are largely beyond our control may adversely affect consumer behavior and our results of operations 

our business results depend on a number of industryspecific and general economic factors many of which are beyond our control the fullservice dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in international national regional and local economic conditions seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant brands the performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends severe weather including hurricanes traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants 

general economic conditions may also adversely affect our results of operations recessionary economic cycles a protracted economic slowdown a worsening economy increased unemployment increased energy prices rising interest rates a downgrade of the us governments longterm credit rating the european debt crisis or other industrywide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings job losses foreclosures bankruptcies and falling home prices could cause guests to make fewer discretionary purchases and any significant decrease in our guest traffic or average profit per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance in addition if gasoline natural gas electricity and other energy costs increase and credit card home mortgage and other 

borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine out may spend less on each dining out occasion or may choose more inexpensive restaurants 

furthermore we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts terrorist attacks efforts to combat terrorism heightened security requirements or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems could have on our operations the economy or consumer confidence generally any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures 

unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our guests could increase our costs reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact consumer spending patterns affect the availability and cost of credit and increase pension plan expenses 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control turmoil in global credit markets could adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future there can be no assurances that we will be able to arrange credit on terms we believe are acceptable or that permit us to finance our business with historical margins a lack of credit could have an adverse impact on certain of our suppliers landlords and other tenants in retail centers in which we are located if these issues occur they could negatively affect our financial results any new disruptions in the financial markets may also adversely affect the us and world economy which could negatively impact consumer spending patterns changes in the capital markets could also have significant effects on our pension plan our pension income or expense is affected by factors including the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for the pension plans for some of our employees the weighted average asset allocation and longterm rate of return of our pension plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the interest cost component of our net periodic pension cost if our pension plan assets do not achieve positive rates of return or if our estimates and assumed rates are not accurate our earnings may decrease because net periodic pension costs would rise and we could be required to provide additional funds to cover our obligations to employees under the pension plan 

we face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees business partners and vendors in foreign markets 

our expansion into international markets could create risks to our brands and reputation we believe that we have selected highcaliber international operating partners and franchisees with significant experience in restaurant operations and are providing them with training and support however the probability of opening ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests principally with the franchisee if the franchisee does not successfully open and operate its restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards or guests have negative experiences due to issues with food quality or operational execution our brand values could suffer which could have an adverse effect on our business 

there also is no assurance that international operations will be profitable or that international growth will continue our international operations are subject to all of the same risks associated with our domestic operations as well as a number of additional risks these include among other things international economic and political conditions foreign currency fluctuations and differing cultures and consumer preferences 

we also are subject to governmental regulations throughout the world that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors these include antitrust and tax requirements antiboycott regulations importexportcustoms regulations and other international trade regulations the usa patriot act the foreign corrupt practices act and applicable local law failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business 

we regard our darden ®  darden restaurants ®  olive garden ®  longhorn steakhouse ®  the capital grille ®  yard house ®  bahama breeze ®  seasons 52 ®  eddie vs prime seafood ®  and wildfish seafood grille ®  service marks and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts copyrights patents trademarks service marks and other common law rights such as trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our restaurants and services from infringement we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the united states and foreign jurisdictions however we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other 

persons although our policy is to oppose any such infringement further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources 

impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired we test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit if the carrying value is less than the fair value no impairment exists if the carrying value is higher than the fair value there is an indication of impairment a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment exists factors may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and slower growth rates any adverse change in these factors would have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations we compute the amount of impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we are required to record a noncash impairment charge if the testing performed indicates that goodwill has been impaired 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets primarily the longhorn steakhouse ®  the capital grille ®  yard house ® and eddie vs prime seafood ®  trademarks to determine if they are definite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

as with goodwill we test our indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable we estimate the fair value of the trademarks based on an income valuation model using the relief from royalty method which requires assumptions related to projected sales from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademarks and a discount rate 

we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

failure of our internal controls over financial reporting and future changes in accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results affect our reported results of operations or otherwise harm our business and financial results 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud our growth and acquisition of other restaurant companies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud a significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation 

a change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future changes to existing accounting rules or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our reported financial results additionally our assumptions estimates and judgments related to complex 

accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including but not limited to revenue recognition fair value of investments impairment of longlived assets leases and related economic transactions derivatives pension and postretirement benefits intangibles selfinsurance income taxes property and equipment unclaimed property laws and litigation and stockbased compensation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by us changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business 

  there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants can post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate each of which may harm our performance prospects or business the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction the dissemination of information online could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations regardless of the informations accuracy 

  

many of our competitors are expanding their use of social media and new social media platforms are rapidly being developed potentially making more traditional social media platforms obsolete as a result we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies in order to maintain broad appeal with guests and brand relevance as part of our marketing efforts we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain guests we also continue to invest in other digital marketing initiatives that allow us to reach our guests across multiple digital channels and build their awareness of engagement with and loyalty to our brands these initiatives may not be successful resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues increased employee engagement or brand recognition in addition a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media including the improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about us exposure of personally identifiable information fraud or outofdate information the inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation

 strategy 

we believe that capable operators of strong multiunit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the restaurant industry’s fullservice segment generally the restaurant industry is considered to be comprised of three segments quick service fast casual and full service all of our restaurants fall within the fullservice segment which is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains we believe we have strong brands and that the breadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the fullservice restaurant industry this collective capability is the product of investments over many years in areas that are critical to success in our business including brand management excellence restaurant operations excellence supply chain talent management and information technology among other things 

during fiscal 2016 our operating philosophy is focused on improving the core operational fundamentals of the business by providing an outstanding guest experience rooted in culinary innovation attentive service engaging atmosphere and integrated marketing darden enables each brand to reach its full potential by leveraging its scale insight and experience in a way that protects uniqueness and competitive advantages additionally brands can capitalize on insights to deliver customized onetoone customer relationship marketing we hold ourselves accountable for operating our restaurants with a sense of urgency to achieve our commitments to all of our stakeholders 

our established longtime brand olive garden has identified several critical initiatives to further revitalize the brand olive garden plans to improve quality and intensify the focus on the guest in addition the brand expects to capitalize on the 

convenience trend of the restaurant industry and utilize an integrated communication platform the introduction of the cucina mia menu which allows our guests to select from popular elements of our menu has reduced the need for constant deep discounted price pointed promotions and has allowed for greater flexibility within menu choices olive garden has also seen strong results by the capitalization on guests’ need for convenience through togo ordering the restaurant menus reflect a focus on the guest and expand both choices and variety to further enrich the convenience trend 

longhorn plans to continue to differentiate the guest experience through culinary innovation and improvements in marketing longhorn utilizes current food trends usually developed at independent and finedining restaurants and utilizes seasonal menu items to strengthen quality and freshness perceptions individually portioned appetizers are also available 

the main focus of our smaller brands is on obtaining greater penetration within new regions of the country and opening new successful restaurant locations additionally we are focusing on regaining samerestaurant sales momentum particularly at yard house and seasons 52 darden’s emphasis within yard house is on expanding late night occasions as well as accelerating beverage and culinary innovation seasons 52 is working on perfecting the seasonal and regional menu strategy as well as evolving operations excellence and increasing brand awareness throughout new markets 

recent and planned restaurant growth 

during fiscal 2015  we opened 33  net new companyowned restaurants in the united states and canada our fiscal 2015  actual restaurant openings and closings and fiscal 2016 projected openings by brand are shown below 

 

the actual number of openings for each of our brands will depend on many factors including our ability to locate appropriate sites negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms obtain necessary local governmental permits complete construction and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel our objective is to continue to expand all of our restaurant brands 

we consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant’s longterm success and we devote significant effort to the site selection process prior to entering a market we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors these factors include trade area demographics such as target population density and household income levels competitive influences in the trade area the site’s visibility accessibility and traffic volume and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls hotelmotel complexes offices and universities members of senior management evaluate inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after permits are obtained and the site is acquired 

the following table illustrates the approximate average capital investment square footage and dining capacity of the olive garden restaurants and longhorn steakhouse restaurants opened during the threeyear period ending fiscal 2015  and yard house restaurants opened during the twoyear period ending fiscal 2015  the table excludes any rebuilt restaurants 



 we systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards when a restaurant falls below minimum standards we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes and implement marketing and operational plans to improve that restaurant’s performance if performance does not improve to acceptable levels the restaurant is evaluated for relocation closing or conversion to one of our other brands permanent closures are typically due to economic changes in trade areas the expiration of lease agreements or site concerns accordingly we continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges 

restaurant operations 

we believe that highquality restaurant management is critical to our longterm success our restaurant management structure varies by brand and restaurant size we issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards 

each typical olive garden restaurant is led by a general manager and each longhorn steakhouse restaurant is led by a managing partner each also has two to five additional managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant in addition each restaurant typically employs an average of 50 to 120 hourly employees most of whom work parttime restaurant general managers or managing partners report to a director of operations who is responsible for approximately six to ten restaurants each director of operations of olive garden and longhorn steakhouse reports to a senior vice president of operations who is responsible for up to one hundred restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by operations management including officer level executives to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards 

each bahama breeze and yard house restaurant is led by a general manager and each the capital grille seasons 52 and eddie vs restaurant is led by a managing partner each also has one to six managers each the capital grille seasons 52 and eddie vs restaurant has one to three executive chefs and each bahama breeze and yard house restaurant has one to three culinary managers in addition each restaurant typically employs an average of 65 to 150 hourly employees most of whom work parttime the general manager or managing partner of each restaurant reports directly to a director of operations who has operational responsibility for approximately three to ten restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by operations management including officer level executives to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards 

our learning center of excellence in partnership with each brand’s head of training together with senior operations executives is responsible for developing and maintaining our operations training programs these efforts include an 11 to 12week training program for management trainees seven to nine weeks in the case of internal promotions and continuing development programs for managers supervisors and directors the emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant brand but includes leadership restaurant business management and culinary skills we also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants including deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations the opening training teams typically begin work one and a half weeks prior to opening and remain at the new restaurant for up to three weeks after the opening they are redeployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant’s operating staff 

we maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our managementlevel employees we believe that our leadership position strong successoriented culture and various shortterm and longterm incentive programs including stock and stockbased compensation help attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers 

quality assurance 

our total quality department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe highquality food in a clean and safe environment through rigorous supplier and risk based product evaluations we purchase only products that meet or exceed our product specifications we rely on independent third parties to inspect and evaluate our suppliers and distributors suppliers that produce “highrisk” products are subject to a food safety evaluation by darden personnel at least annually we require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive hazard analysis and critical control point 

“haccp” food safety programs and risk based preventative controls adopted by the us food and drug administration these programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause foodborne illnesses by applying scientificallybased controls to analyze hazards identify and monitor critical control points and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met we require routine microbiological testing of high risk products in addition our total quality managers and third party auditors visit each restaurant periodically throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation the total quality managers also serve as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety 

purchasing and distribution 

our ability to ensure a consistent supply of highquality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant brands depends on reliable sources of procurement our purchasing staff sources negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 1700 suppliers whose products originate in more than 10 countries suppliers must meet our requirements and strict quality control standards in the development harvest catch and production of food products competitive bids longterm contracts and strategic supplier relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products 

we believe that our purchasing capabilities are a significant competitive advantage our purchasing staff travels routinely within the united states and internationally to source topquality food products at competitive prices we believe that we have established excellent longterm relationships with key suppliers and usually source our product directly from producers not brokers or middlemen we actively support several national minority supplier organizations to ensure that darden incorporates women and minorityowned businesses in all of its purchasing decisions 

we continue to progress in automating our supply chain allowing our suppliers logistics partners and distributors to improve optimization with information visibility through our subsidiary darden direct distribution inc darden direct and longterm agreements with our third party national distribution companies we maintain inventory ownership of food and supplies in warehouses primarily dedicated to darden where practical to do so darden direct further enables our purchasing staff to integrate demand forecasts into longterm agreements driving efficiencies in production economics when we collaborate with vendors because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales

our size enables us to be a leading advertiser in the fullservice dining segment of the restaurant industry olive garden leverages the efficiency of national network television advertising olive garden supplements this with cable local television and digital advertising longhorn steakhouse uses local television and digital advertising to build engagement and loyalty by market the capital grille yard house bahama breeze seasons 52 and eddie vs do not use television advertising but rely on local and digital marketing our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to create awareness and to attract guests we implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase our sales and profits as well as strengthen our brands we also rely on outdoor billboard direct mail and email advertising as well as radio newspapers digital coupons search engine marketing and social media such as facebook ®  and twitter ®  as appropriate to attract and retain guests we have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor guest satisfaction and evolving expectations

competition 

the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food price service restaurant location personnel brand attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing the restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing restaurants and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power we compete within each market with national and regional chains and locallyowned restaurants for guests management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites we also face growing competition from the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section in addition improving product offerings at fast casual restaurants and quickservice restaurants together with negative economic conditions could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives we expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas 

other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled “purchasing and distribution” “advertising and marketing” and “information technology” in this item 1 and in our risk factors in item 1a of this form 10k

our restaurant operations outside of the united states and canada are conducted through area development and franchise agreements in october 2010 we entered into a formal agreement with an unaffiliated operator to develop and operate olive garden and longhorn steakhouse restaurants in the middle east the agreement calls for the operator to develop a minimum of 35 restaurants in bahrain egypt kuwait lebanon qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emirates over the next five years as of may 31 2015  we have 7 restaurants in the region two olive garden restaurants in united arab emirates three olive garden restaurants in kuwait a longhorn steakhouse restaurant in saudi arabia and a longhorn steakhouse restaurant in qatar open under this agreement in august 2011 we entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated operator to develop and operate olive garden and the capital grille brands in mexico the agreement calls for the operator to initially develop a minimum of 29 restaurants in mexico over the next five years as of may 31 2015 ten olive garden restaurants and one the capital grille restaurant had been opened in mexico under this agreement in february 2013 we entered into a formal agreement with an unaffiliated operator to develop and operate olive garden and longhorn steakhouse brands in central and south america the agreement calls for the operator to develop a minimum of 30 restaurants in brazil colombia the dominican republic and panama as of may 31 2015 one olive garden restaurant has been opened in brazil under this agreement and the rights to develop the panama territory have been sold to the operator of our restaurant locations in guatemala el salvador honduras nicaragua and costa rica in july 2013 we entered into separate formal agreements with two unaffiliated operators to develop and operate olive garden and longhorn steakhouse restaurants in central america and south america one agreement calls for the operator to develop 21 restaurants in guatemala el salvador honduras nicaragua and costa rica and as amended panama the other agreement calls for the second unaffiliated operator to develop 11 restaurants in peru as of may 31 2015 one olive garden restaurant has been opened in peru one olive garden restaurant has been opened in el salvador and one longhorn steakhouse restaurant has been opened in el salvador in september 2013 we entered into a formal agreement with an unaffiliated operator to develop and operate olive garden and longhorn steakhouse restaurants in malaysia as of may 31 2015 one olive garden restaurant and one longhorn steakhouse restaurant have been opened in malaysia in july 2014 we entered into a formal agreement with an unaffiliated operator to develop and operate olive garden and longhorn steakhouse restaurants in ecuador where no restaurants have opened to date we do not have an ownership interest in any of these franchisees but we receive royalty income under the area development and franchise agreements the amount of income we derive from our joint venture and franchise arrangements is not material to our consolidated financial statements

seasonality 

our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally typically our average sales per restaurant are highest in the spring and winter followed by the summer and lowest in the fall holidays changes in the economy severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions because of the seasonality of our business results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

government regulation 

we are subject to various federal state local and international laws affecting our business each of our restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities which include health safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located the development and operation of restaurants depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites which are subject to zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations to date we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals 

during fiscal 2015  122 percent  of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site in most cases on an annual basis and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time these regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant operation including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours of operation advertising wholesale purchasing inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages the failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these licenses would adversely affect the restaurant’s operations we also are subject in certain states to “dramshop” statutes which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person who then causes injury to himself or a third party we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance 

we also are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws governing such matters as overtime tip credits working conditions safety standards and hiring and employment practices changes in these laws during fiscal 2015  have not had a material effect on our operations 

we currently are operating under a tip rate alternative commitment “trac” agreement with the internal revenue service through increased educational and other efforts in the restaurants the trac agreement reduces the likelihood of potential chainwide employeronly fica tax assessments for unreported cash tips 

we are subject to federal and state environmental regulations but these rules have not had a material effect on our operations during fiscal 2015  there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated 

our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 “ada” and related state accessibility statutes under the ada and related state laws we must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment and when constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of our restaurants we must make those facilities accessible 

we continue to review the health care reform law enacted by congress in march of 2010 “affordable care act” and related rules and regulations as part of that review we evaluate the potential impacts of this law on our business and accommodate various parts of the law as they take effect 

we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food including regulations regarding product safety nutritional content and menu labeling we are or may become subject to laws and regulations requiring disclosure of calorie fat trans fat salt and allergen content the affordable care act requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus the food and drug administration has proposed rules to implement this provision that would require restaurants to post the number of calories for most items on menus or menu boards and to make available more detailed nutrition information upon request 

we are subject to laws relating to information security privacy cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud an increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information including social security numbers financial information including credit card numbers and health information 

see item 1a “risk factors” below for a discussion of risks relating to federal state and local regulation of our business including in the areas of health care reform data privacy and environmental matters

 item 1a risk factors 

various risks and uncertainties could affect our business any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations 

our strategic real estate plan which includes the transfer of a portion of our real estate assets to a new real estate investment trust “reit” that will be separated by a spinoff splitoff or similar transaction resulting in the reit becoming an independent publiclytraded company the “reit transaction” may not be completed or may not deliver its intended results which could adversely affect our business 

on june 23 2015 we announced the reit transaction the completion of the reit transaction is subject to a number of implementation and operational complexities including the separation of some of our real estate assets into a reit there can be no assurances that the reit transaction will be completed and there are a number of risks and uncertainties related to the reit transaction including 

 12 

 we have the right to terminate the transaction even if all of the conditions have been satisfied if the board determines in its sole and absolute discretion that the reit transaction is not in the best interests of the company and its shareholders or that market conditions or other circumstances are such that the reit transaction is no longer advisable at that time while we have considered a variety of strategies including alternative financings capital and tax strategies designed to maximize longterm shareholder value there can be no assurances that the reit transaction will be the most beneficial alternative considered 

in connection with our strategic real estate plan we may be locked into longterm and noncancelable leases that we may want to cancel and may be unable to renew the leases that we may want to extend at the end of their terms 

under the strategic real estate plan being pursued we will transfer approximately 430 of our owned restaurant properties to the reit with substantially all of the reit’s initial assets being leased back to us in addition we have been marketing selected properties for individual sale leasebacks to date we have listed approximately 75 properties including our orlando restaurant support center property and buildings the initial terms for the leases for these properties is 15 years except in a few cases and have fixed rent escalations for the initial term and multiple renewal options at our discretion if we close a restaurant we may remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease which would include among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term additionally the potential losses associated with our inability to cancel leases may result in our keeping open restaurant locations that are performing significantly below targeted levels as a result ongoing lease obligations at closed or underperforming restaurant locations could impair our results of operations in addition at the end of the lease term and expiration of all renewal periods we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost if at all as a result we may be required to close or relocate a restaurant which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks and may have an adverse effect on our operating performance 

a failure to maintain food safety throughout the supply chain and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

food safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe quality food products however food safety issues could be caused at the point of source or by food suppliers or distributors and as a result be out of our control in addition regardless of the source or cause any report of foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination at one of our restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our brands and have a negative impact on our sales even instances of foodborne illness food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients resulting in higher costs and lower margins 

litigation including allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees guests suppliers shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation these actions and proceedings may involve allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices including wage and hour violations and employment discrimination guest discrimination food safety issues including poor food quality foodborne illness food tampering food contamination and adverse health effects from consumption of various food products or highcalorie foods including obesity other personal injury violation of “dram shop” laws providing an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or a third party trademark infringement violation of the federal securities laws or other concerns the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time the cost to defend litigation may be significant there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation 

that could decrease guest acceptance of our brands regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are found liable litigation could impact our operations in other ways as well allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices for example could adversely affect employee acquisition and retention as a result litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable publicity or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could harm our reputation and adversely impact our guest counts and sales 

the good reputation of our restaurant brands is a key factor in the success of our business actual or alleged incidents at any of our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could harm our brands even incidents occurring at restaurants operated by our competitors or in the supply chain generally could result in negative publicity that could harm the restaurant industry overall and indirectly our own brands negative publicity may result from allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices employee dissatisfaction guest discrimination illness injury or any of the other matters discussed above that could give rise to litigation regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants or only to a single restaurant could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand negative publicity also may result from health concerns including food safety and flu outbreaks publication of government or industry findings concerning food products environmental disasters crime incidents data privacy breaches scandals involving our employees or operational problems at our restaurants all of which could make our brands and menu offerings less appealing to our guests and negatively impact our guest counts and sales adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of our brands or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to a number of risks relating to public policy changes and federal state and local regulation of our business including in the areas of health care reform environmental matters minimum wage unionization data privacy menu labeling immigration requirements and taxes and an insufficient or ineffective response to government regulation may impact our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability 

the restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal state local and international laws and regulations the development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites which are subject to building zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations and requirements we are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health sanitation safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food including regulations regarding product safety nutritional content and menu labeling we are subject to federal and state laws governing minimum wages unionization and other labor issues these include the fair labor standards act of 1938 and requirements concerning overtime paid or family leave tip credits working conditions and safety standards they also include the immigration reform and control act of 1986 which requires among other things the preparation of form i9 to verify that employees are authorized to accept employment in the united states 

we also are subject to federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities such as the ada compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation new or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our labor costs 

the affordable care act was enacted in march 2010 we have continued to evaluate the potential impacts of this law on our business and accommodate various parts of the law and related rules and regulations as they take effect there are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can accommodate all of the costs associated with compliance we did not receive taxfree subsidies for providing prescription drugs to retirees under medicare part d therefore we have no deferred tax assets associated with our retiree medical plan that would be impacted by this law the affordable care act also requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus although the fda published proposed regulations to implement the nutritional menu labeling provisions it has delayed release of final regulations we do not expect to incur any material costs from compliance with this provision but cannot anticipate any changes in guest behavior resulting from the implementation of this portion of the law which could have an adverse effect on our sales or results of operations we are also reviewing the potential impacts of new laws associated with health care passed by various state and local governments 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge emission and disposal of hazardous materials there also has been increasing focus by united states and overseas governmental authorities on other environmental matters such as climate change the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption this increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating a yet to be specified array of environmental matters such as the emission of greenhouse gases where “cap and trade” initiatives could effectively impose a tax on carbon emissions legislative regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in the cost of raw 

materials taxes transportation and utilities which could decrease our operating profits and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment 

we are subject to laws relating to information security privacy cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud an increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information including social security numbers financial information including credit card numbers and health information compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and any failure or perceived failure to comply with those laws could harm our reputation or lead to litigation which could adversely affect our financial condition 

the impact of current laws and regulations the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues could increase our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal state and local authorities could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings 

we may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs 

our restaurant operations are subject to united states and canadian federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages working conditions overtime and tip credits as federal and state minimum wage rates increase we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage labor shortages increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs this in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales conversely if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices our profitability may decline in addition the current premiums that we pay for our insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property health and directors’ and officers’ liability may increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs the dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers’ compensation and general liability insurance for which we carry high perclaim deductibles may also increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs further the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses 

we rely heavily on information technology in our operations and insufficient guest or employee facing technology or a failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network free from material failure interruption or security breach could harm our ability to effectively operate our business andor result in the loss of respected relationships with our guests or employees 

we rely heavily on information systems across our operations including for marketing programs employee engagement management of our supply chain pointofsale processing system in our restaurants and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems in addition we must effectively respond to changing guest expectations and new technological developments disruptions failures or other performance issues with these guest facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our business and negatively affect our relationship with our guest the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems a material network breach in the security of these systems as a result of a cyber attack or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to us or an individual this could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets or the improper use of personal information or other “identity theft” each of these situations or data privacy breaches may cause delays in guest service reduce efficiency in our operations require significant capital investments to remediate the problem result in customer or advertiser dissatisfaction or otherwise result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation and we could be subjected to litigation regulatory investigations or the imposition of penalties as privacy and information security laws and regulations change and cyber risks evolve we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance 

our inability or failure to execute on a comprehensive business continuity plan following a major natural disaster such as a hurricane or manmade disaster including terrorism at our corporate facility could have a materially adverse impact on our business 

many of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one florida location   we have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature including hurricanes and other natural disasters and back up and offsite locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information however if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans we may experience delays in recovery of data inability to perform vital corporate functions tardiness in required reporting and compliance failures 

to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims 

health concerns arising from foodrelated pandemics outbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

the united states and other countries have experienced or may experience in the future outbreaks of viruses such as norovirus avian flu or “sars” and h1n1 or “swine flu” or other diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy commonly known as “mad cow disease” to the extent that a virus or disease is foodborne or perceived to be foodborne future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product or could reduce public confidence in food handling andor public assembly for example health concerns relating to the consumption of beef or to specific events such as an outbreak of “mad cow disease” may adversely impact sales at longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille restaurants that offer beef as a primary menu item in addition public concern over avian flu may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry the inability to serve beef or poultrybased products would restrict our ability to provide a variety of menu items to our guests if we change a restaurant menu in response to such concerns we may lose guests who do not prefer the new menu and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new guest base to produce the sales needed to make the restaurant profitable we also may have different or additional competitors for our intended guests as a result of such a change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors if a virus is transmitted by human contact our employees or guests could become infected or could choose or be advised to avoid gathering in public places any of which could adversely affect our restaurant guest traffic and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level we also could be adversely affected if jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition and if we have an insufficient focus on competition and the consumer landscape our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

the fullservice dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing service location personnel and type and quality of food and there are many wellestablished competitors we compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locallyowned restaurants we also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services particularly in the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section we compete primarily on the quality variety and value perception of menu items the number and location of restaurants type of brand quality and efficiency of service attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors we anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors if we are unable to continue to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our failure to drive both shortterm and longterm profitable sales growth through brand relevance operating excellence and opening new restaurants of existing brands and developing new dining brands could result in poor financial performance 

as part of our business strategy we intend to drive profitable sales growth by increasing samerestaurant sales at existing restaurants continuing to expand our current portfolio of restaurant brands and developing additional brands that can be expanded profitably this strategy involves numerous risks and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives 

at existing brands we may not be able to maintain brand relevance and restaurant operating excellence to achieve sustainable samerestaurant sales growth and warrant new unit growth existing brand shortterm sales growth could be impacted if we are unable to drive near term guest count and sales growth and longterm sales growth could be impacted if we fail to extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to our guests a failure to innovate and extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to guests and occasions in order to generate sustainable samerestaurant traffic growth and produce nontraditional sales and earnings growth opportunities insufficient focus on our competition or failure to adequately address the decline of the casual dining industry could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition we may not be able to support sustained new unit growth or open all of our planned new restaurants and the new restaurants that we open may not be profitable or as profitable as our existing restaurants new restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize and even sales at successful newlyopened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation the opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on sales levels at existing restaurants 

the ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations the need to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses on a timely basis the need to comply 

with other regulatory requirements the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay construction increases in labor and building material costs the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms changes in weather or other acts of god that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions at each potential location we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites construction contractors management personnel hourly employees and other resources if we are unable to successfully manage these risks we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated sales and earnings in future periods 

we also may not be able to identify and integrate additional brands or develop new business opportunities that are as profitable as our existing restaurants 

our plans to expand our smaller brands bahama breeze seasons 52 and eddie vs and the testing of other new business ventures that have not yet proven their longterm viability may not be successful which could require us to make substantial further investments in those brands and new business ventures and result in losses and impairments 

while each of our restaurant brands as well as each of our individual restaurants are subject to the risks and uncertainties described above there is an enhanced level of risk and uncertainty related to the operation and expansion of our smaller brands such as bahama breeze seasons 52 and eddie vs these brands and new business ventures have not yet proven their longterm viability or growth potential we have made substantial investments in the development and expansion of each of these brands and further investment is required while we have implemented a number of changes to operations at bahama breeze and believe we have improved the guest experience and unit economics sufficiently to restart modest unit growth there can be no assurance that these changes will continue to be successful or that additional new unit growth will occur seasons 52 and eddie vs also are in the early stages of their development and will require additional resources to support further growth our other new business initiatives such as the sale of consumer packaged goods have not yet proved their longterm viability and may not be successful 

in each case these brands and business initiatives will continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties that accompany any emerging restaurant brand or new business initiative 

a lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

the success of our restaurants depends in large part on their locations as demographic and economic patterns change current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations in addition desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation the occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may experience higherthananticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants we incur substantial preopening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close relocate or remodel existing restaurants the expenses of opening closing relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated an increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

a failure to identify and execute innovative marketing and guest relationship tactics ineffective or improper use of other marketing initiatives and increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

if our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions if our advertising media or marketing expenses increase or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors or if we do not adequately leverage technology and data analytic capabilities needed to generate concise competitive insight we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations a failure to sufficiently innovate develop guest relationship initiatives or maintain adequate and effective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales 

as part of our marketing efforts we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain guests and will begin efforts to consolidate our brands into a single digital technology platform these initiatives may not be successful and pose a variety of other risks as discussed below under the heading our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could materially adversely impact our business 

a failure to recruit develop and retain effective leaders the loss or shortage of personnel with key capacities and skills or an inability to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction could impact our strategic direction and jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

our future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other employees our future growth also depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain highquality employees to work in and manage our restaurants we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees in order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth changes in senior management could expose us to significant changes in strategic direction and initiatives a failure to maintain appropriate organizational capacity and capability to support leadership excellence adequate resources innovative skill sets and expectations and build adequate bench strength required for growth a loss of key employees or a significant shortage of highquality restaurant employees and an inability to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction which could lead to poor guest satisfaction higher turnover litigation and unionization which could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

a failure to address cost pressures including rising costs for commodities labor health care and utilities used by our restaurants and a failure to effectively deliver cost management activities and achieve economies of scale in purchasing could compress our margins and adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food ingredients labor health care utilities and other related costs over which we may have little control operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities including shrimp lobster crab and other seafood as well as beef pork chicken cheese and produce the introduction of or changes to tariffs on imported food products such as shrimp could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products we cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results we attempt to leverage our size to achieve economies of scale in purchasing but there can be no assurances that we can always do so effectively we are subject to the general risks of inflation 

increases in minimum wage health care and other benefit costs may have a material adverse effect on our labor costs we operate in many states and localities where the minimum wage is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage increases in minimum wage may also result in increases in the wage rates paid for nonminimum wage positions 

our restaurants’ operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as electricity and natural gas whether as a result of inflation or otherwise on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply in addition interruptions to the availability of gas electric water or other utilities whether due to aging infrastructure weather conditions fire animal damage trees digging accidents or other reasons largely out of our control may adversely affect our operations our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may lose sales or incur increased costs if our restaurants experience shortages or interruptions in the delivery of food and other products from our third party vendors and suppliers 

shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants may be caused by inclement weather natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods droughts and earthquakes the inability of our vendors to obtain credit in a tightened credit market or remain solvent given disruptions in the financial markets or other conditions beyond our control such shortages or interruptions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants we may have a limited number of suppliers for certain of our products supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our restaurant operations if we raise prices as a result of increased food costs or shortages it may negatively impact our sales if we temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular items from a restaurant’s menu that restaurant may experience a significant reduction in sales during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our guests changing their dining habits 

adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could adversely affect our restaurant sales 

adverse weather conditions can impact guest traffic at our restaurants cause the temporary underutilization of outdoor patio seating and in more severe cases such as hurricanes tornadoes or other natural disasters cause temporary closures sometimes for prolonged periods which would negatively impact our restaurant sales changes in weather could result in construction delays interruptions to the availability of utilities and shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies which could increase our costs some climatologists predict that the longterm effects of climate change and global warming may result in more severe volatile weather or extended droughts which could increase the frequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to hedge exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we use or may use derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs including but not limited to coffee butter wheat soybean oil pork beef diesel fuel gasoline and natural gas changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings included in our consolidated financial statements we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these market factors 

certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and other general macroeconomic factors including unemployment energy prices and interest rates that are largely beyond our control may adversely affect consumer behavior and our results of operations 

our business results depend on a number of industryspecific and general economic factors many of which are beyond our control the fullservice dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in international national regional and local economic conditions seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant brands the performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends severe weather including hurricanes traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants 

general economic conditions may also adversely affect our results of operations recessionary economic cycles a protracted economic slowdown a worsening economy increased unemployment increased energy prices rising interest rates a downgrade of the us governments longterm credit rating the european debt crisis or other industrywide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings job losses foreclosures bankruptcies and falling home prices could cause guests to make fewer discretionary purchases and any significant decrease in our guest traffic or average profit per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance in addition if gasoline natural gas electricity and other energy costs increase and credit card home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine out may spend less on each dining out occasion or may choose more inexpensive restaurants 

furthermore we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts terrorist attacks efforts to combat terrorism heightened security requirements or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems could have on our operations the economy or consumer confidence generally any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures 

unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our guests could increase our costs reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact consumer spending patterns affect the availability and cost of credit and increase pension plan expenses 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control global credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil over the last few years characterized by the bankruptcy failure or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states and other governments these events may adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future there can be no assurances that we will be able to arrange credit on terms we believe are acceptable or that permit us to finance our business with historical margins the lack of credit along with the macroeconomic factors previously discussed may have an adverse impact on certain of our suppliers landlords and other tenants in retail centers in which we are located if these issues continue or worsen they could further materially impact these parties which in turn could negatively affect our financial results any new or continuing disruptions in the financial markets may also adversely affect the us and world economy which could negatively impact consumer spending patterns there can be no assurances as to how or when this period of turmoil will be resolved changes in the capital markets could also have significant effects on our pension plan our pension income or expense is affected by factors including the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for the pension plans for some of our employees the weighted average asset allocation and longterm rate of return of our pension plan assets the discount rate used to determine the service and interest cost components of our net periodic pension cost and assumed rates of increase in our employees’ future compensation if our pension plan assets do not achieve positive rates of return or if our 

estimates and assumed rates are not accurate our earnings may decrease because net periodic pension costs would rise and we could be required to provide additional funds to cover our obligations to employees under the pension plan 

we face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees business partners and vendors in foreign markets 

our expansion into international markets could create risks to our brands and reputation we believe that we have selected highcaliber international operating partners and franchisees with significant experience in restaurant operations and are providing them with training and support however the probability of opening ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee if the franchisee does not successfully open or operate its restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards or guests have negative experiences due to issues with food quality or operational execution our brand values could suffer which could have an adverse effect on our business 

there also is no assurance that international operations will be profitable or that international growth will continue our international operations are subject to all of the same risks associated with our domestic operations as well as a number of additional risks these include among other things international economic and political conditions foreign currency fluctuations and differing cultures and consumer preferences 

we also are subject to governmental regulations throughout the world that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors these include antitrust and tax requirements antiboycott regulations importexportcustoms regulations and other international trade regulations the usa patriot act the foreign corrupt practices act and applicable local law failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business 

we regard our darden ®  darden restaurants ®  olive garden ®  longhorn steakhouse ®  the capital grille ®  yard house ®  bahama breeze ®  seasons 52 ®  eddie vs prime seafood ®  and wildfish seafood grille ®  service marks and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts copyrights patents trademarks service marks and other common law rights such as trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our restaurants and services from infringement we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the united states and foreign jurisdictions however we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other persons although our policy is to oppose any such infringement further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources 

impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired we test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit if the carrying value is less than the fair value no impairment exists if the carrying value is higher than the fair value there is an indication of impairment a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment exists factors may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and slower growth rates any adverse change in these factors would have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations we compute the amount of impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we are required to record a noncash impairment charge if the testing performed indicates that goodwill has been impaired 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets primarily the longhorn steakhouse ®  the capital grille ®  yard house ® and eddie vs prime seafood ®  trademarks to determine if they are definite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

as with goodwill we test our indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable we estimate the fair value of the trademarks based on an income valuation model using the relief from royalty method which requires assumptions related to projected sales from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademarks and a discount rate 

we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

failure of our internal controls over financial reporting and future changes in accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results affect our reported results of operations or otherwise harm our business and financial results 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud our growth and acquisition of other restaurant companies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud a significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock 

a change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future changes to existing accounting rules or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our reported financial results additionally our assumptions estimates and judgments related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including but not limited to revenue recognition fair value of investments impairment of longlived assets leases and related economic transactions derivatives pension and postretirement benefits intangibles selfinsurance income taxes property and equipment unclaimed property laws and litigation and stockbased compensation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by us changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could materially adversely impact our business 

  there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants can post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate each of which may harm our performance prospects or business the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction the dissemination of information online could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations regardless of the informations accuracy 

  

many of our competitors are expanding their use of social media and new social media platforms are rapidly being developed potentially making more traditional social media platforms obsolete as a result we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies in order to maintain broad appeal with guests and brand relevance as part of our marketing efforts we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain guests we have initiated a multiyear effort to implement new technology platforms that will allow us to digitally engage with our guests and employees and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities in this increasingly connected society these initiatives may not be successful resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues increased employee engagement or brand recognition in addition a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media including the improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about us exposure of personally identifiable information fraud or outofdate information the inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation

 strategy 

the restaurant industry is generally considered to be comprised of three segments quick service fast casual and full service our restaurants are all within the full service segment which is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains we believe that capable operators of strong multiunit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the full service segment we believe we have strong brands and that the breadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the full service restaurant industry this collective capability is the product of investments over many years in areas that are critical to success in our business including brand management excellence restaurant operations excellence supply chain talent management and information technology among other things 

during fiscal 2015 we are focused on progressing with our value creation priorities which include completion of the red lobster sale continuation of the olive garden brand renaissance continuation of new restaurant growth at our other brands primarily driven by longhorn implementation of a new management incentive plan that more directly emphasizes samerestaurant sales free cash flow and relative total shareholder return continuation of the focus on our restaurant support platform costs and improvement of capital allocation discipline 

the total sales growth we envision should increase the costeffectiveness of our restaurant support platform however we also plan to supplement our conventional incremental yeartoyear cost management efforts with an ongoing focus on identifying and pursuing transformational multiyear cost reduction opportunities 

while we are a leader in the full service dining segment we know we cannot be successful without a clear sense of who we are our business is a people business and our core purpose is “to nourish and delight everyone we serve” this core purpose is supported by our core values 

  

 

our mission is to be “the best now and for generations and a place where people can achieve their dreams” we feel we have a compelling opportunity to create a company thats more valuable and valued  a company that matters we believe we can achieve this goal by continuing to build on our strategy to be a brandbuilding company which is focused on

synergy restaurants 

in march 2011 we opened a test “synergy restaurant” that housed both a red lobster and olive garden restaurant in the same building but with separate front doors dining rooms and brandspecific menus we developed this concept to test expansion into smaller markets that would not meet our population density requirements to build a single brand we opened a second synergy test location during fiscal 2012 and four locations during fiscal 2013    in connection with the anticipated sale of red lobster we closed two synergy locations in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014 leaving a total of four locations operating at the end of fiscal 2014 the results of operations and asset impairment charges of the two closed locations are included in discontinued operations we expect to convert the four remaining restaurants to olive garden restaurants by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2015 

recent and planned restaurant growth 

during fiscal 2014  we opened 70  net new restaurants in the united states and canada our fiscal 2014 actual and fiscal 2015 projected net new openings in the us and canada from continuing operations by brand are shown below 

1 excludes restaurants that were included in discontinued operations 

the actual number of openings for each of our brands will depend on many factors including our ability to locate appropriate sites negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms obtain necessary local governmental permits complete construction and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel our objective is to continue to expand all of our restaurant brands 

we consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant’s longterm success and we devote significant effort to the site selection process prior to entering a market we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors these factors include trade area demographics such as target population density and household income levels competitive influences in the trade area the site’s visibility 

accessibility and traffic volume and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls hotelmotel complexes offices and universities members of senior management evaluate inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after permits are obtained and the site is acquired 

the following table illustrates the approximate average capital investment square footage and dining capacity of the nine olive garden restaurants and the 34 longhorn steakhouse restaurants 33 new restaurants and one relocation opened during fiscal 2014 the table excludes any rebuilt restaurants 



 we systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards when a restaurant falls below minimum standards we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes and implement marketing and operational plans to improve that restaurant’s performance if performance does not improve to acceptable levels the restaurant is evaluated for relocation closing or conversion to one of our other brands 

during fiscal 2012 we permanently closed one red lobster and two longhorn steakhouse restaurants during fiscal 2013 we temporarily closed one longhorn steakhouse and permanently closed one red lobster restaurant during fiscal 2014 we permanently closed two synergy restaurants permanent closures are typically due to economic changes in trade areas the expiration of lease agreements or site concerns accordingly we continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges as of may 25 2014 there were two temporarily closed olive garden restaurants which we expect to reopen during fiscal 2015 and two permanently closed olive garden restaurants 

restaurant operations 

we believe that highquality restaurant management is critical to our longterm success our restaurant management structure varies by brand and restaurant size we issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards 

each typical olive garden restaurant is led by a general manager and each longhorn steakhouse restaurant is led by a managing partner each also has three to five additional managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant in addition each restaurant typically employs an average of 50 to 120 hourly employees most of whom work parttime restaurant general managers or managing partners report to a director of operations who is responsible for approximately six to ten restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by operations management including officer level executives to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards red lobsters restaurant management is consistent with that of olive garden 

since the completion of our new operations organizational structure during fiscal year 2013 each director of operations of olive garden and longhorn steakhouse reports to a regional vice president the new regional vice president role which typically supervises six to eight directors of operations further strengthens our restaurant operations expertise by elevating the execution required to build guest loyalty and enhance our talent development capacity in the field four to five regional vice presidents are supervised by a senior vice president of operations which reduces the span of control for our senior vice presidents of operations our new operations organizational structure now allows our senior vice president of operations role to focus on identifying new tools support and operations strategies required to sustainably grow guest counts and sales in their particular division and better enable talent rotation and sharing across our brands 

each bahama breeze and yard house restaurant is led by a general manager and each the capital grille seasons 52 and eddie vs restaurant is led by a managing partner each also has one to six managers each the capital grille seasons 52 and eddie vs restaurant has one to three executive chefs and each bahama breeze and yard house restaurant has one to three culinary managers in addition each restaurant typically employs an average of 65 to 150 hourly employees most of whom work parttime the general manager or managing partner of each restaurant reports directly to a director of operations who has operational responsibility for approximately three to ten restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by operations management including officer level executives to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards 

our learning center of excellence in partnership with each brand’s head of training together with senior operations executives are responsible for developing and maintaining our operations training programs these efforts include a 12 to 13week training program for management trainees seven to nine weeks in the case of internal promotions and continuing development programs for managers supervisors and directors the emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant brand but includes leadership restaurant business management and culinary skills we also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants including deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations the opening training teams typically begin work one and a half weeks prior to opening and remain at the new restaurant for up to three weeks after the opening they are redeployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant’s operating staff 

we maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our managementlevel employees we believe that our leadership position strong successoriented culture and various shortterm and longterm incentive programs including stock and stockbased compensation help attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers 

quality assurance 

our total quality department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe highquality food in a clean and safe environment through rigorous physical evaluation and testing at our north american laboratories and through “point source inspection” by our international team of quality specialists in several foreign countries we purchase only seafood that meets or exceeds our specifications we use independent third parties to inspect and evaluate commodity vendors in addition any commodity supplier that produces a “highrisk” product is subject to a food safety evaluation by darden personnel at least annually we require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive hazard analysis and critical control point “haccp” food safety programs adopted by the us food and drug administration the haccp programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause foodborne illnesses by applying scientificallybased controls to analyze hazards identify and monitor critical control points and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met since 1976 we have required routine microbiological testing of seafood and other commodities for quality and microbiological safety in addition our total quality managers and third party auditors visit each restaurant periodically throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation the total quality managers also serve as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety 

purchasing and distribution 

our ability to ensure a consistent supply of highquality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant brands depends on reliable sources of procurement our purchasing staff sources negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 2000 suppliers whose products originate in more than 30 countries suppliers must meet our requirements and strict quality control standards in the development harvest catch and production of food products competitive bids longterm contracts and longterm vendor relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products 

we believe that our seafood purchasing capabilities are a significant competitive advantage our purchasing staff travels routinely within the united states and internationally to source more than 100 varieties of topquality seafood at competitive prices we believe that we have established excellent longterm relationships with key seafood vendors and usually source our product directly from producers not brokers or middlemen while the supply of certain seafood species is volatile we believe we have the ability to identify alternative seafood products and to adjust our menus as necessary 

all other essential food products are available or can be made available upon short notice from alternative qualified suppliers  we continue to progress in automating our supply chain allowing our suppliers logistics partners and distributors to improve optimization with information visibility through our subsidiary darden direct distribution inc darden direct and longterm agreements with our third party national distribution companies we maintain inventory ownership in dedicated environments where practical darden direct further enables our purchasing staff to integrate demand forecasts into longterm agreements driving efficiencies in production economics when we collaborate with vendors we continue to invest in new technologies to improve restaurant product orders receiving invoice approval and inventories across the supply chain this improves the ability of our logistics infrastructure to replenish restaurants with the right products at the right price and with justintime delivery because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales 

our supplier diversity initiative which focuses on women and minorityowned businesses is the major driver behind dardens efforts to bring about diversity awareness and opportunities within our supplier network we actively support several national minority supplier organizations to ensure that darden incorporates women and minorityowned businesses in all of its purchasing decisions 

advertising and marketing 

we believe we have developed significant marketing and advertising capabilities our size enables us to be a leading advertiser in the full service dining segment of the restaurant industry olive garden leverages the efficiency of national network television advertising olive garden supplements this with cable local television and digital advertising longhorn steakhouse began using national cable 

television advertising in fiscal 2011 in addition longhorn steakhouse uses local television and digital advertising to strengthen its brand awareness the capital grille yard house bahama breeze seasons 52 and eddie vs do not use national television advertising our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to create awareness and to attract guests we implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase our sales and profits as well as strengthen our brands we also rely on outdoor billboard direct mail and email advertising as well as radio newspapers digital coupons search engine marketing and social media such as facebook ®  and twitter ®  as appropriate to attract and retain guests during fiscal 2013 we launched electronic gift cards that can be ordered on all of our brand websites and sent instantly online buyers can personalize these egift cards by recording their voices attaching photos and letting facebook friends know they have bought a card we have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor guest satisfaction and evolving expectations 

in fiscal 2014 we began efforts to consolidate our brands into a single digital technology platform strengthen brand relevance and drive longerterm sales growth the new digital platform will enable our brands to tailor marketing programs to enhance consumer relevance and strengthen brand loyalty we also developed and tested a new online ordering system for olive garden we expect to implement this new system on a nationwide basis in fiscal 2015 in fiscal 2014 olive garden continued to develop spanish language advertising to increase awareness and visits from hispanic consumers

information technology 

we strive for leadership in the restaurant business by using technology as a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy since 1975 computers located in the restaurants have been used to assist in the management of the restaurants we have implemented technologyenabled business solutions targeted at improved financial control cost management enhanced guest service and improved employee effectiveness these solutions are designed to be used across restaurant brands yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant brand our strategy is to fully integrate systems to drive operational efficiencies and enable restaurant teams to focus on restaurant operations excellence over the past few years we completed the implementation of a talent acquisition system across all brands to help streamline the hiring process for front line employee candidates additionally we implemented a new meal pacing system and a new table management system to enhance the guest experience by providing accurate wait times pacing the preparation of menu items based on cooktimes and enhancing restaurant capacity by increasing table turns 

in fiscal 2014 we continued a multiyear effort to implement new technology platforms that will allow us to digitally engage with our guests and employees and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities in this increasingly connected society these technology platforms will be leveraged across all brands to build guest loyalty and employee engagement ultimately this multiyear effort will be integrated into all guest touch points including restaurant operating systems to enable compelling personalized guest experiences

competition 

the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food price service restaurant location personnel brand attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing the restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing restaurants and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power we compete within each market with national and regional chains and locallyowned restaurants for guests management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites we also face growing competition from the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section in addition improving product offerings at fast casual restaurants and quickservice restaurants together with negative economic conditions could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives we expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas 

other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled “purchasing and distribution” “advertising and marketing” and “information technology” in this item 1 and in our risk factors in item 1a of this form 10k

our restaurant operations outside of the united states and canada are conducted through area development and franchise agreements we have an agreement with an unaffiliated japanese corporation that operated 23 red lobster restaurants in japan as of may 25 2014  in october 2010 we entered into a formal agreement with an unaffiliated operator to develop and operate olive garden red lobster and longhorn steakhouse restaurants in the middle east the agreement calls for the operator to develop a minimum of 60 restaurants in bahrain egypt kuwait lebanon qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emirates over the next five years as of may 25 2014  we have 12 restaurants in the region two red lobster restaurants and one olive garden restaurant in united arab emirates one red lobster restaurant in qatar two red lobster restaurants and three olive garden restaurants in kuwait and two red lobster restaurants and a longhorn steakhouse restaurant in saudi arabia open under this agreement in august 2011 we entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated operator to develop and operate olive garden red lobster and the capital grille brands in mexico the agreement calls for the operator to initially develop a minimum of 37 restaurants in mexico over the next five years as of may 25 2014 five olive garden restaurants one red lobster restaurant and one the capital grille restaurant had been opened in mexico under this agreement

during fiscal 2013 and continuing in fiscal 2014 we achieved distribution for several items at walmart including olive garden regular and light salad dressing extra virgin olive oil two sizes of balsamic vinegar longhorn seasoning and olive garden seasoning we also distributed certain red lobsterrelated products including the cheddar bay biscuit mix and red lobster seasoning that will all be included in the proposed red lobster sale we have expanded olive garden salad dressing into broad distribution channels including most major grocery chains we also are researching and developing proprietary technology for lobster aquaculture farming 

seasonality 

our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally typically our average sales per restaurant are highest in the spring and winter followed by the summer and lowest in the fall holidays changes in the economy severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions because of the seasonality of our business results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

government regulation 

we are subject to various federal state local and international laws affecting our business each of our restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities which include health safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located the development and operation of restaurants depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites which are subject to zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations to date we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals 

during fiscal 2014  110 percent of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site in most cases on an annual basis and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time these regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant operation including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours of operation advertising wholesale purchasing inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages the failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these licenses would adversely affect the restaurant’s operations we also are subject in certain states to “dramshop” statutes which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person who then causes injury to himself or a third party we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance 

we also are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws governing such matters as overtime tip credits working conditions safety standards and hiring and employment practices changes in these laws during fiscal 2014  have not had a material effect on our operations 

we currently are operating under a tip rate alternative commitment “trac” agreement with the internal revenue service through increased educational and other efforts in the restaurants the trac agreement reduces the likelihood of potential chainwide employeronly fica assessments for unreported tips 

we are subject to federal and state environmental regulations but these rules have not had a material effect on our operations during fiscal 2014  there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated 

our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 “ada” and related state accessibility statutes under the ada and related state laws we must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment and when constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of our restaurants we must make those facilities accessible 

we continue to review the health care reform law enacted by congress in march of 2010 “affordable care act” and related rules and regulations as part of that review we evaluate the potential impacts of this law on our business and accommodate various parts of the law as they take effect 

we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food including regulations regarding product safety nutritional content and menu labeling we are or may become subject to laws and regulations requiring disclosure of calorie fat trans fat salt and allergen content the affordable care act requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus the food and drug administration has proposed rules to implement this provision that would require restaurants to post the number of calories for most items on menus or menu boards and to make available more detailed nutrition information upon request 

we are subject to laws relating to information security privacy cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud an increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information including social security numbers financial information including credit card numbers and health information 

see item 1a “risk factors” below for a discussion of risks relating to federal state and local regulation of our business including in the areas of health care reform data privacy and environmental matters

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

various risks and uncertainties could affect our business any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations therefore the following is not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

unsuccessful implementation of our strategic plan could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our strategic plan to enhance shareholder value including the proposed red lobster sale the “red lobster sale” may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of the strategic plan including any benefits from the red lobster sale any inability to realize the anticipated benefits from the strategic plan could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the delay or termination of the proposed red lobster sale may adversely affect our financial condition and our business 

  

in may 2014 we entered into an agreement for the red lobster sale the closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions while closing of the transaction is expected in the first quarter of our fiscal 2015 there can be no assurance that the closing will in fact occur or that significant delays in closing the transaction will not result an event change or other circumstances could give rise to the termination of the agreement for the red lobster sale certain shareholders have expressed opposition to the red lobster sale there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any legal proceeding that may be instituted against us in connection with the red lobster sale a failure to close the transaction significant delays in doing so or potential litigation may negatively impact the trading price of our securities and our financial condition and our business 

  

our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders and such activism could impact the trading value of the company’s securities 

  

certain shareholders have expressed opposition to the company’s strategic plan and their intent to take actions designed to prevent full implementation of our strategic plan and in particular the proposed red lobster sale responding to actions by activist shareholders can be costly and timeconsuming disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan the perceived uncertainties as to our future direction also could affect the market price and volatility of our securities 

certain activist shareholders have made or indicated they will in the future make strategic proposals suggestions or requested changes concerning the companys operations strategy management businesses or other matters we cannot predict and no assurances can be given as to the outcome or timing of any matters relating to the foregoing and any such matters may impact the value of the companys securities 

a potential proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting could distract our management divert our resources and absent board action trigger a change of control under our indebtedness resulting in acceleration and have a material adverse impact on our business liquidity and financial condition 

  

on may 22 2014 starboard value lp and its affiliates “starboard” delivered a letter to us nominating 12 director candidates for election to the board at our 2014 annual meeting of shareholders the “2014 annual meeting” it is possible that starboardnominated directors could constitute a majority of the board following the 2014 annual meeting 

  

a proxy contest would require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and the board further any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control could result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

in addition the terms of our revolving credit facility and our term loan agreement include change of control triggers regarding a turnover of a majority of our board resulting in a potential event of default such an event of default would also give rise to an event of default under our indenture dated as of january 1 1996 pursuant to which we have 19 billion of debt currently outstanding however the terms of such change of control provisions generally enable the board to take technical actions or make determinations that would avoid such change of control provisions from being triggered in the event a majority of the board changes in connection with a proxy contest in the event starboard proceeds with its threatened election contest the board will undertake an appropriate review and consider what determinations or actions could or should be made to address the potential adverse consequences to the company from a change of control including with respect to any outstanding indebtedness 

  

certain outstanding series of our debt require that we make a change of control offer upon a change of control triggering event as with the change of control provisions in our revolving credit facility and term loan agreement these provisions likewise generally enable the board to take technical actions or make determinations that would avoid such change of control offers from being triggered our 6200 senior notes due 2017 our 450 senior notes due 2021 our 3350 senior notes due 2022 and our 6800 senior notes due 2037 all require us to make a change of control offer at 101 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest when there is both i a “change of control” as defined therein and ii a “below investment grade rating event” as defined therein further our 379 senior notes due 2019 and our 452 senior notes due 2024 together the “private notes” also require that we make a change of control offer upon a “change of control” as defined therein at 100 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest we have recently agreed to repurchase 80 million of 80 million originally outstanding and 210 million of 220 million originally outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 379 senior notes due 2019 and our 452 senior notes due 2024 respectively our agreement to repurchase the private notes is conditioned upon closing of the anticipated red lobster sale if we are obligated to make any change of control offer we might not have sufficient funds to pay the required price for our notes following a change of control 

we are engaged in discussions with certain of our lenders with regard to these provisions 

absent the technical board action described above acceleration of the obligations under certain of our indebtedness or our obligation to make change of control offers pursuant to the terms of certain series of our notes could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to conduct our business and could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

further a change in a majority of the board may under certain circumstances result in a change of control under management continuity agreements we have with our executive management pursuant to the agreements certain payments may be triggered following a change of control but only upon a qualifying termination that occurs within 24 months of any such change of control 

a change in a majority of the board may also result in a change of control under certain contracts with third parties if we are unable to secure appropriate waivers or amendments to any such contracts the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

a failure to maintain food safety throughout the supply chain and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

food safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe quality food products however food safety issues could be caused at the point of source or by food suppliers or distributors and as a result be out of our control in addition regardless of the source or cause any report of foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination at one of our restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our brands and have a negative impact on our sales even instances of foodborne illness food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients resulting in higher costs and lower margins 

litigation including allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees guests suppliers shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation these actions and proceedings may involve allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices including wage and hour violations and employment discrimination guest discrimination food safety issues including poor food quality foodborne illness food tampering food contamination and adverse health effects from consumption of various food products or highcalorie foods including obesity other personal injury violation of “dram shop” laws providing an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or a third party trademark infringement violation of the federal securities laws or other concerns the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time the cost to defend litigation may be significant there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease guest acceptance of our brands regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are found liable litigation could impact our operations in other ways as well allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices for example could adversely affect employee acquisition and retention as a result litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable publicity or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could harm our reputation and adversely impact our guest counts and sales 

the good reputation of our restaurant brands is a key factor in the success of our business actual or alleged incidents at any of our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could harm our brands even incidents occurring at restaurants operated by our competitors or in the supply chain generally could result in negative publicity that could harm the restaurant industry overall and indirectly our own brands negative publicity may result from allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices employee dissatisfaction guest discrimination illness injury or any of the other matters discussed above that could give rise to litigation regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants or only to a single restaurant could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand negative publicity also may result from health concerns including food safety and flu outbreaks publication of government or industry findings concerning food products environmental disasters crime incidents data privacy breaches scandals involving our employees or operational problems at our restaurants all of which could make our brands and menu offerings less appealing to our guests and negatively impact our guest counts and sales adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of our brands or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to a number of risks relating to public policy changes and federal state and local regulation of our business including in the areas of health care reform environmental matters minimum wage unionization data privacy menu labeling immigration requirements and taxes and an insufficient or ineffective response to government regulation may impact our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability 

the restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal state local and international laws and regulations the development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites which are subject to building zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations and requirements we are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health sanitation safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food including regulations regarding product safety nutritional content and menu labeling we are subject to federal and state laws governing minimum wages unionization and other labor issues these include the fair labor standards act of 1938 and requirements concerning overtime paid or family leave tip credits working conditions and safety standards they also include the immigration reform and control act of 1986 which requires among other things the preparation of form i9 to verify that employees are authorized to accept employment in the united states 

we also are subject to federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities such as the ada compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation new or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our labor costs 

the affordable care act was enacted in march 2010 we have continued to evaluate the potential impacts of this law on our business and accommodate various parts of the law and related rules and regulations as they take effect there are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can accommodate all of the costs associated with compliance we did not receive taxfree subsidies for providing prescription drugs to retirees under medicare part d therefore we have no deferred tax assets associated with our retiree medical plan that would be impacted by this law the affordable care act also requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus although the fda published proposed regulations to implement the nutritional menu labeling provisions it has delayed release of final regulations we do not expect to incur any 

material costs from compliance with this provision but cannot anticipate any changes in guest behavior resulting from the implementation of this portion of the law which could have an adverse effect on our sales or results of operations we are also reviewing the potential impacts of new laws associated with health care passed by various state and local governments 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge emission and disposal of hazardous materials there also has been increasing focus by united states and overseas governmental authorities on other environmental matters such as climate change the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption this increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating a yet to be specified array of environmental matters such as the emission of greenhouse gases where “cap and trade” initiatives could effectively impose a tax on carbon emissions legislative regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials taxes transportation and utilities which could decrease our operating profits and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment 

we are subject to laws relating to information security privacy cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud an increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information including social security numbers financial information including credit card numbers and health information compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and any failure or perceived failure to comply with those laws could harm our reputation or lead to litigation which could adversely affect our financial condition 

the impact of current laws and regulations the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues could increase our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal state and local authorities could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings 

we may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs 

our restaurant operations are subject to united states and canadian federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages working conditions overtime and tip credits as federal and state minimum wage rates increase we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage labor shortages increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs this in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales conversely if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices our profitability may decline in addition the current premiums that we pay for our insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property health and directors’ and officers’ liability may increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs the dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers’ compensation and general liability insurance for which we carry high perclaim deductibles may also increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs further the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses 

we rely heavily on information technology in our operations and insufficient guest or employee facing technology or a failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network free from material failure interruption or security breach could harm our ability to effectively operate our business andor result in the loss of respected relationships with our guests or employees 

we rely heavily on information systems across our operations including for marketing programs employee engagement management of our supply chain pointofsale processing system in our restaurants and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems a material network breach in the security of these systems as a result of a cyber attack or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to us or an individual this could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets or the improper use of personal information or other “identity theft” each of these situations or data privacy breaches may cause delays in guest service reduce efficiency in our operations require significant capital investments to remediate the problem or result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation and we could be subjected to litigation or the imposition of penalties 

our inability or failure to execute on a comprehensive business continuity plan following a major natural disaster such as a hurricane or manmade disaster including terrorism at our corporate facility could have a materially adverse impact on our business 

many of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one florida location   we have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature including hurricanes and other natural disasters and back up and offsite locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information however if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans we may experience delays in recovery of data inability to perform vital corporate functions tardiness in required reporting and compliance failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims 

health concerns arising from foodrelated pandemics outbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

the united states and other countries have experienced or may experience in the future outbreaks of viruses such as norovirus avian flu or “sars” and h1n1 or “swine flu” or other diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy commonly known as “mad cow disease” to the extent that a virus or disease is foodborne or perceived to be foodborne future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product or could reduce public confidence in food handling andor public assembly for example health concerns relating to the consumption of beef or to specific events such as an outbreak of “mad cow disease” may adversely impact sales at longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille restaurants that offer beef as a primary menu item in addition public concern over avian flu may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry the inability to serve beef or poultrybased products would restrict our ability to provide a variety of menu items to our guests if we change a restaurant menu in response to such concerns we may lose guests who do not prefer the new menu and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new guest base to produce the sales needed to make the restaurant profitable we also may have different or additional competitors for our intended guests as a result of such a change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors if a virus is transmitted by human contact our employees or guests could become infected or could choose or be advised to avoid gathering in public places any of which could adversely affect our restaurant guest traffic and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level we also could be adversely affected if jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition and if we have an insufficient focus on competition and the consumer landscape our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

the full service dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing service location personnel and type and quality of food and there are many wellestablished competitors we compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locallyowned restaurants we also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services particularly in the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section we compete primarily on the quality variety and value perception of menu items the number and location of restaurants type of brand quality and efficiency of service attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors we anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors if we are unable to continue to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our failure to drive both shortterm and longterm profitable sales growth through brand relevance operating excellence and opening new restaurants of existing brands could result in poor financial performance 

as part of our business strategy we intend to drive profitable sales growth by increasing samerestaurant sales at existing restaurants this strategy involves numerous risks and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives 

at existing brands we may not be able to maintain brand relevance and restaurant operating excellence to achieve sustainable samerestaurant sales growth and warrant new unit growth existing brand shortterm sales growth could be impacted if we are unable to drive near term guest count growth and longterm sales growth could be impacted if we fail to extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to our guests a failure to define and deliver clear relevant brands that generate sustainable samerestaurant traffic growth and produce nontraditional sales and earnings growth opportunities or to evolve inrestaurant and brand support cost structures so that competitively strong sales growth results in stable and improving profit margins could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition we may not be able to support sustained new unit growth or open all of our planned new restaurants and the new restaurants that we open may not be profitable or as profitable as our existing restaurants new restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize and even sales at successful newlyopened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation the opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on sales levels at existing restaurants 

the ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations the need to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses on a timely basis the need to comply with other regulatory requirements the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay construction increases in labor and building material costs the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms changes in weather or other acts of god that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions at each potential location we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites construction contractors management personnel hourly employees and other resources if we are unable to successfully manage these risks we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated sales and earnings in future periods 

our plans to expand our smaller brands bahama breeze seasons 52 and eddie vs and the testing of other new business ventures that have not yet proven their longterm viability may not be successful which could require us to make substantial further investments in those brands and new business ventures and result in losses and impairments 

while each of our restaurant brands as well as each of our individual restaurants are subject to the risks and uncertainties described above there is an enhanced level of risk and uncertainty related to the operation and expansion of our smaller brands such as bahama breeze seasons 52 and eddie vs and the lobster aquaculture farming activities these brands and new business ventures have not yet proven their longterm viability or growth potential we have made substantial investments in the development and expansion of each of these brands and further investment is required while we have implemented a number of changes to operations at bahama breeze and believe we have improved the guest experience and unit economics sufficiently to restart modest unit growth there can be no assurance that these changes will continue to be successful or that additional new unit growth will occur seasons 52 and eddie vs also are in the early stages of their development and will require additional resources to support further growth our other new business initiatives such as the sale of consumer packaged goods and lobster aquaculture farming have not yet proved their longterm viability and may not be successful 

in each case these brands and business initiatives will continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties that accompany any emerging restaurant brand or new business initiative 

a lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

the success of our restaurants depends in large part on their locations as demographic and economic patterns change current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations in addition desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation the occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may experience higherthananticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants we incur substantial preopening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close relocate or remodel existing restaurants the expenses of opening closing relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated an increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

a failure to identify and execute innovative marketing and guest relationship tactics ineffective or improper use of other marketing initiatives and increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

if our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions if our advertising media or marketing expenses increase or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors or if we do not adequately leverage technology and data analytic capabilities needed to generate concise competitive insight we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations a failure to sufficiently innovate develop guest relationship initiatives or maintain adequate and effective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales 

as part of our marketing efforts we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain guests and will begin efforts to consolidate our brands into a single digital technology platform these initiatives may not be successful 

and pose a variety of other risks as discussed below under the heading our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could materially adversely impact our business 

a failure to recruit develop and retain effective leaders the loss or shortage of personnel with key capacities and skills or an inability to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

our future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other employees our future growth also depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain highquality employees to work in and manage our restaurants we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees in order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth a failure to maintain appropriate organizational capacity and capability to support leadership excellence adequate resources innovative skill sets and expectations and build adequate bench strength required for growth a loss of key employees or a significant shortage of highquality restaurant employees and an inability to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction which could lead to poor guest satisfaction higher turnover litigation and unionization which could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

a failure to address cost pressures including rising costs for commodities health care and utilities used by our restaurants and a failure to effectively deliver cost management activities and achieve economies of scale in purchasing could compress our margins and adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food ingredients health care utilities unemployment and other related costs over which we may have little control operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities including shrimp lobster crab and other seafood as well as beef pork chicken cheese and produce the introduction of or changes to tariffs on imported shrimp or other food products could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products we attempt to leverage our size to achieve economies of scale in purchasing but there can be no assurances that we can always do so effectively we are subject to the general risks of inflation our restaurants’ operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as electricity and natural gas whether as a result of inflation or otherwise on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply in addition interruptions to the availability of gas electric water or other utilities whether due to aging infrastructure weather conditions fire animal damage trees digging accidents or other reasons largely out of our control may adversely affect our operations our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may lose sales or incur increased costs if our restaurants experience shortages or interruptions in the delivery of food and other products from our third party vendors and suppliers 

shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants may be caused by inclement weather natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods droughts and earthquakes the inability of our vendors to obtain credit in a tightened credit market or remain solvent given disruptions in the financial markets or other conditions beyond our control such shortages or interruptions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants we may have a limited number of suppliers for certain of our products supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our restaurant operations if we raise prices as a result of increased food costs or shortages it may negatively impact our sales if we temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular items from a restaurant’s menu that restaurant may experience a significant reduction in sales during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our guests changing their dining habits 

adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could adversely affect our restaurant sales 

adverse weather conditions can impact guest traffic at our restaurants cause the temporary underutilization of outdoor patio seating and in more severe cases such as hurricanes tornadoes or other natural disasters cause temporary closures sometimes for prolonged periods which would negatively impact our restaurant sales changes in weather could result in construction delays interruptions to the availability of utilities and shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies which could increase our costs some climatologists predict that the longterm effects of climate change and global warming may result in more severe volatile weather or extended droughts which could increase the frequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to hedge exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we use or may use derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs including but not limited to coffee butter wheat soybean oil pork beef diesel fuel gasoline and natural gas changes in the values of these 

derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings included in our consolidated financial statements we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these market factors 

certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and other general macroeconomic factors including unemployment energy prices and interest rates that are largely beyond our control may adversely affect consumer behavior and our results of operations 

our business results depend on a number of industryspecific and general economic factors many of which are beyond our control the full service dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in international national regional and local economic conditions seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant brands the performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends severe weather including hurricanes traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants 

general economic conditions may also adversely affect our results of operations recessionary economic cycles a protracted economic slowdown a worsening economy increased unemployment increased energy prices rising interest rates a downgrade of the us governments longterm credit rating the european debt crisis or other industrywide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings job losses foreclosures bankruptcies and falling home prices could cause guests to make fewer discretionary purchases and any significant decrease in our guest traffic or average profit per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance in addition if gasoline natural gas electricity and other energy costs increase and credit card home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine out may spend less on each dining out occasion or may choose more inexpensive restaurants 

furthermore we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts terrorist attacks efforts to combat terrorism heightened security requirements or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems could have on our operations the economy or consumer confidence generally any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures 

unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our guests could increase our costs reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact consumer spending patterns affect the availability and cost of credit and increase pension plan expenses 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control global credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil over the last few years characterized by the bankruptcy failure or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states and other governments these events may adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future there can be no assurances that we will be able to arrange credit on terms we believe are acceptable or that permit us to finance our business with historical margins the lack of credit along with the macroeconomic factors previously discussed may have an adverse impact on certain of our suppliers landlords and other tenants in retail centers in which we are located if these issues continue or worsen they could further materially impact these parties which in turn could negatively affect our financial results any new or continuing disruptions in the financial markets may also adversely affect the us and world economy which could negatively impact consumer spending patterns there can be no assurances as to how or when this period of turmoil will be resolved changes in the capital markets could also have significant effects on our pension plan our pension income or expense is affected by factors including the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for the pension plans for some of our employees the weighted average asset allocation and longterm rate of return of our pension plan assets the discount rate used to determine the service and interest cost components of our net periodic pension cost and assumed rates of increase in our employees’ future compensation if our pension plan assets do not achieve positive rates of return or if our estimates and assumed rates are not accurate our earnings may decrease because net periodic pension costs would rise and we could be required to provide additional funds to cover our obligations to employees under the pension plan 

we face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees business partners and vendors in foreign markets 

our expansion into international markets could create risks to our brands and reputation we believe that we have selected highcaliber international operating partners and franchisees with significant experience in restaurant operations and are providing 

them with training and support however the probability of opening ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee if the franchisee does not successfully open or operate its restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards or guests have negative experiences due to issues with food quality or operational execution our brand values could suffer which could have an adverse effect on our business 

there also is no assurance that international operations will be profitable or that international growth will continue our international operations are subject to all of the same risks associated with our domestic operations as well as a number of additional risks these include among other things international economic and political conditions foreign currency fluctuations and differing cultures and consumer preferences 

we also are subject to governmental regulations throughout the world that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees vendors and conduct our affairs with lobster aquaculture farming these include antitrust and tax requirements antiboycott regulations importexportcustoms regulations and other international trade regulations the usa patriot act the foreign corrupt practices act and applicable local law failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business 

we regard our darden ®  darden restaurants ®  olive garden ®  red lobster ®  longhorn steakhouse ®  the capital grille ®  yard house ®  bahama breeze ®  seasons 52 ®  eddie vs prime seafood ®  and wildfish seafood grille ®  service marks and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts copyrights patents trademarks service marks and other common law rights such as trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our restaurants and services from infringement we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the united states and foreign jurisdictions however we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other persons although our policy is to oppose any such infringement further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources 

impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired we test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit if the carrying value is less than the fair value no impairment exists if the carrying value is higher than the fair value there is an indication of impairment a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment exists factors may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and slower growth rates any adverse change in these factors would have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations we compute the amount of impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we are required to record a noncash impairment charge if the testing performed indicates that goodwill has been impaired 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets primarily the longhorn steakhouse ®  the capital grille ®  yard house ® and eddie vs prime seafood ®  trademarks to determine if they are definite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

as with goodwill we test our indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable we estimate the fair value of the trademarks based on an income valuation model using the relief from royalty method which requires assumptions related to projected sales from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademarks and a discount rate 

we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

failure of our internal controls over financial reporting and future changes in accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results affect our reported results of operations or otherwise harm our business and financial results 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud our growth and acquisition of other restaurant companies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud a significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock 

a change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future changes to existing accounting rules or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our reported financial results additionally our assumptions estimates and judgments related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including but not limited to revenue recognition fair value of investments impairment of longlived assets leases and related economic transactions derivatives pension and postretirement benefits intangibles selfinsurance income taxes property and equipment unclaimed property laws and litigation and stockbased compensation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by us changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could materially adversely impact our business 

  there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices including weblogs blogs social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants can post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate each of which may harm our performance prospects or business the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction the dissemination of information online could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations regardless of the informations accuracy 

  

as part of our marketing efforts we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms such as facebook® and twitter® to attract and retain guests we have initiated a multiyear effort to implement new technology platforms that will allow us to digitally engage with our guests and employees and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities in this increasingly connected society these initiatives may not be successful resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues or increased employee engagement in addition a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media including the improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about us exposure of personally identifiable information fraud or outofdate information the inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation

properties – general 

during fiscal 1999 we formed two subsidiary corporations each of which elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust “reit” under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code these elections limit the activities of both 

corporations to holding certain real estate assets the formation of these two reits is designed primarily to assist us in managing our real estate portfolio and possibly to provide a vehicle to access capital markets in the future both reits were structured as nonpublic reits 

during fiscal 2013 we merged one of the reit entities into another subsidiary of darden restaurants inc the second reit was merged into gmri inc our whollyowned subsidiary during fiscal 2014 as a result of these mergers all restaurant property that was previously owned by the merged reits was returned to darden corporate entities that operate the corresponding restaurants at the sites for financial reporting purposes the second reit is included in our consolidated financial statements during a portion of fiscal 2014 

in connection with the sale and lease back of our former restaurant support center buildings we purchased several adjacent parcels of vacant land in orange county florida and relocated our headquarters to this site during the second quarter of fiscal 2010 the site includes a main headquarters building data center and parking deck the restaurant support center campus at this new location offers a more collaborative and unified environment with additional room for future growth during fiscal year 2013 we commenced the first phase of hotelretail development on the adjacent parcels of land to our restaurant support center buildings the first phase of hotelretail development includes construction of a 128room hotel by an unaffiliated third party hotel operator the hotel will be utilized as lodging for those attending training sessions at our restaurant support center

 strategy 

the restaurant industry is generally considered to be comprised of two segments quick service and full service the full service segment is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains we believe that capable operators of strong multiunit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the full service segment we believe we have strong 

brands and that the breadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the full service restaurant industry this collective capability is the product of investments over many years in areas that are critical to success in our business including brand management excellence restaurant operations excellence supply chain talent management and information technology among other things 

to support future growth we are striving to change in two important ways we are modifying our organizational structure so we can better leverage our existing experience and expertise and we are adding new expertise in additional areas that are critical to future success in the past three years we have created enterpriselevel marketing and restaurant operations units and established forwardlooking strategy units in certain functions we have initiatives focusing on our specialty restaurant group enterpriselevel sales building digital guest and employee engagement health and wellness and centers of excellence to maintain strong brand relevance and strengthen guest experience and loyalty we are moving forward with a multiyear program to build and leverage a single digital technology platform we plan to grow by leveraging our expertise and new capabilities to increase samerestaurant sales and increase the number of restaurants in each of our existing brands we also continue to pursue other avenues of new business development including franchising our restaurants outside of the us and canada testing synergy restaurants and other formats to expand our brands and selling consumer packaged goods such as olive gardens salad dressing and red lobsters cheddar bay biscuit mix 

the total sales growth we envision should increase the costeffectiveness of our support platform however we also plan to supplement our conventional incremental yeartoyear cost management efforts with an ongoing focus on identifying and pursuing transformational multiyear cost reduction opportunities in fiscal 2014 we plan to continue to implement three transformational initiatives  further automating our supply chain significantly reducing the use of energy water and cleaning supplies in our restaurants and optimizing labor costs within our restaurants 

while we are a leader in the full service dining segment we know we cannot be successful without a clear sense of who we are ours is a people business and our core purpose is “to nourish and delight everyone we serve” this core purpose is supported by our core values 

  

 

our mission is to be “the best now and for generations and a place where people can achieve their dreams” we feel we have a compelling opportunity to create a company thats more valuable and valued  a company that matters we believe we can achieve this goal by continuing to build on our strategy to be a brandbuilding company which is focused on

in march 2011 we opened a test “synergy restaurant” that houses both a red lobster and olive garden restaurant in the same building but with separate front doors dining rooms and brandspecific menus the shared building is designed to keep the guest experience the same while delivering cost efficiencies we developed this concept to test expansion into smaller markets that would not meet our population density requirements to build a single brand future synergy restaurants may not be limited to red lobster and olive garden combinations but could involve our other brands as well we opened a second synergy test location during fiscal 2012 and four locations during fiscal 2013 

recent and planned restaurant growth 

during fiscal 2013  we opened 104  net new restaurants in the united states and canada our actual and projected net new openings in the us and canada from continuing operations by brand are shown below 

1 excludes acquisition of 40 yard house restaurants during fiscal 2013 

the actual number of openings for each of our brands will depend on many factors including our ability to locate appropriate sites negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms obtain necessary local governmental permits complete construction and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel our objective is to continue to expand all of our restaurant brands and to develop or acquire additional brands that can be expanded profitably we continue to test new ideas and brands and also to evaluate potential acquisition candidates to assess whether they would satisfy our strategic and financial objectives 

in connection with our growth objectives on august 29 2012 we acquired yard house usa inc “yard house” for 585 million in an allcash transaction yard house which launched its first restaurant in 1996 now has 44 restaurants across 16 states 

we consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant’s longterm success and we devote significant effort to the site selection process prior to entering a market we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors these factors include trade area demographics such as target population density and household income levels competitive influences in the trade area the site’s visibility accessibility and traffic volume and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls hotelmotel complexes offices and universities members of senior management evaluate inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after permits are obtained and the site is acquired

 we systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards when a restaurant falls below minimum standards we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes and implement marketing and operational 

plans to improve that restaurant’s performance if performance does not improve to acceptable levels the restaurant is evaluated for relocation closing or conversion to one of our other brands 

during fiscal 2010 we permanently closed three red lobster and three longhorn steakhouse restaurants during fiscal 2011 we permanently closed one red lobster two olive garden and two longhorn steakhouse restaurants during fiscal 2012 we permanently closed one red lobster and two longhorn steakhouse restaurants during fiscal 2013 we permanently closed one red lobster restaurant permanent closures are typically due to economic changes in trade areas the expiration of lease agreements or site concerns accordingly we continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges as of may 26 2013 there was also one temporarily closed longhorn steakhouse restaurant which we expect to reopen during fiscal 2014 

restaurant operations 

we believe that highquality restaurant management is critical to our longterm success our restaurant management structure varies by brand and restaurant size we issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards 

each typical red lobster and olive garden restaurant is led by a general manager and each longhorn steakhouse restaurant is led by a managing partner each also has three to five additional managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant in addition each restaurant typically employs an average of 50 to 120 hourly employees most of whom work parttime restaurant general managers or managing partners report to a director of operations who is responsible for approximately six to ten restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by operations management including officer level executives to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards 

since the completion of our new operations organizational structure during fiscal year 2013 each director of operations of red lobster olive garden and longhorn steakhouse reports to either a regional vice president or a managing director the new regional vice president and managing director roles which typically supervise six to eight directors of operations further strengthen our restaurant operations expertise by elevating the execution required to build guest loyalty and enhance our talent development capacity in the field three to four regional vice presidents or managing directors are supervised by a senior vice president of operations which reduces the span of control for our senior vice presidents of operations our new operations organizational structure now allows our senior vice president of operations role to focus on identifying new tools support and operations strategies required to sustainably grow guest counts and sales in their particular division and better enable talent rotation and sharing across our brands 

each bahama breeze and yard house restaurant is led by a general manager and each the capital grille seasons 52 and eddie vs restaurant is led by a managing partner each also has one to six managers each the capital grille seasons 52 and eddie vs restaurant has one to three executive chefs and each bahama breeze and yard house restaurant has one to three culinary managers in addition each restaurant typically employs an average of 65 to 150 hourly employees most of whom work parttime the general manager or managing partner of each restaurant reports directly to a director of operations who has operational responsibility for approximately three to ten restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by all levels of supervision to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards 

our learning center of excellence in partnership with each brand’s head of training together with senior operations executives are responsible for developing and maintaining our operations training programs these efforts include a 12 to 13week training program for management trainees seven to nine weeks in the case of internal promotions and continuing development programs for managers supervisors and directors the emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant brand but includes leadership restaurant business management and culinary skills we also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants including deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations the opening training teams typically begin work one and a half weeks prior to opening and remain at the new restaurant for up to three weeks after the opening they are redeployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant’s operating staff 

we maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our managementlevel employees we believe that our leadership position strong successoriented culture and various shortterm and longterm incentive programs including stock and stockbased compensation help attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers 

quality assurance 

our total quality department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe highquality food in a clean and safe environment through rigorous physical evaluation and testing at our north american laboratories and through “point source inspection” by 

our international team of quality specialists in several foreign countries we purchase only seafood that meets or exceeds our specifications we use independent third parties to inspect and evaluate commodity vendors in addition any commodity supplier that produces a “highrisk” product is subject to a food safety evaluation by darden personnel at least annually we require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive hazard analysis and critical control point “haccp” food safety programs adopted by the us food and drug administration the haccp programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause foodborne illnesses by applying scientificallybased controls to analyze hazards identify and monitor critical control points and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met since 1976 we have required routine microbiological testing of seafood and other commodities for quality and microbiological safety in addition our total quality managers and third party auditors visit each restaurant periodically throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation the total quality managers also serve as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety 

purchasing and distribution 

our ability to ensure a consistent supply of highquality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant brands depends on reliable sources of procurement our purchasing staff sources negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 2000 suppliers whose products originate in more than 30 countries suppliers must meet our requirements and strict quality control standards in the development harvest catch and production of food products competitive bids longterm contracts and longterm vendor relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products 

we believe that our seafood purchasing capabilities are a significant competitive advantage our purchasing staff travels routinely within the united states and internationally to source more than 100 varieties of topquality seafood at competitive prices we believe that we have established excellent longterm relationships with key seafood vendors and usually source our product directly from producers not brokers or middlemen while the supply of certain seafood species is volatile we believe we have the ability to identify alternative seafood products and to adjust our menus as necessary 

all other essential food products are available or can be made available upon short notice from alternative qualified suppliers  we continue to progress in automating our supply chain allowing our suppliers logistics partners and distributors to improve optimization with information visibility through our subsidiary darden direct distribution inc darden direct and longterm agreements with our third party national distribution companies we maintain inventory ownership in dedicated environments where practical darden direct further enables our purchasing staff to integrate demand forecasts into longterm agreements driving efficiencies in production economics when we collaborate with vendors we continue to invest in new technologies to improve restaurant product orders receiving invoice approval and inventories across the supply chain this improves the ability of our logistics infrastructure to replenish restaurants with the right products at the right price and with justintime delivery because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales 

our supplier diversity initiative which focuses on women and minorityowned businesses is the major driver behind dardens efforts to bring about diversity awareness and opportunities within our supplier network we actively support several national minority supplier organizations to ensure that darden incorporates women and minorityowned businesses in all of its purchasing decisions 

advertising and marketing 

we believe we have developed significant marketing and advertising capabilities our size enables us to be a leading advertiser in the full service dining segment of the restaurant industry red lobster and olive garden leverage the efficiency of national network television advertising olive garden supplements this with cable local television and digital advertising and red lobster with cable and digital advertising longhorn steakhouse currently uses local television advertising and began national cable television advertising in fiscal 2011 the capital grille yard house bahama breeze seasons 52 and eddie vs do not use national television advertising our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to attract guests we implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase our sales and profits as well as strengthen our brands we also rely on outdoor billboard direct mail and email advertising as well as radio newspapers digital coupons search engine marketing and social media such as facebook ®  and twitter ®  as appropriate to attract and retain guests during fiscal 2013 we launched electronic gift cards that can be ordered on all of our brand websites and sent instantly online buyers can personalize these egift cards by recording their voices attaching photos and letting facebook friends know they have bought a card we have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor guest satisfaction and evolving expectations 

in fiscal 2014 we will begin efforts to consolidate our brands into a single digital platform strengthen brand relevance and drive longerterm sales growth the new digital platform will enable our brands to tailor marketing programs to enhance consumer 

relevance and strengthen brand loyalty in fiscal 2013 red lobster and olive garden continued to develop spanish language advertising to increase awareness among and visits from hispanic consumers 

employees

competition 

the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food price service restaurant location personnel brand attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing the restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing restaurants and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power we compete within each market with national and regional chains and locallyowned restaurants for guests management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites we also face growing competition from the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section we expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas 

other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled “purchasing and distribution” “advertising and marketing” and “information technology” in this item 1 and in our risk factors in item 1a of this form 10k

our restaurant operations outside of the united states and canada are conducted through area development and franchise agreements we have an agreement with an unaffiliated japanese corporation that operated 23 red lobster restaurants in japan as of may 26 2013  in october 2010 we entered into a formal agreement with an unaffiliated operator to develop and operate olive garden red lobster and longhorn steakhouse restaurants in the middle east the agreement calls for the operator to develop a minimum of 60 restaurants in bahrain egypt kuwait lebanon qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emirates over the next five years as of may 26 2013  six restaurants a red lobster in dubai a red lobster in qatar a red lobster and an olive garden in kuwait a red lobster and an olive garden in abu dhabi had opened under this agreement in august 2011 we entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated operator to develop and operate olive garden red lobster and the capital grille brands in mexico the agreement calls for the operator to initially develop a minimum of 37 restaurants in mexico over the next five years as of may 26 2013 two olive garden restaurants and one the capital grille restaurant had opened in mexico city under this agreement in february 2013 we entered into a formal agreement with an unaffiliated operator to develop and operate olive garden red lobster and longhorn steakhouse brands the agreement calls for the operator to develop a minimum of 57 restaurants in brazil colombia the dominican republic and panama as of may 26 2013 no restaurants had as yet opened under this agreement in july 2013 we entered into separate formal agreements with two unaffiliated operators to develop and operate olive garden red lobster and longhorn steakhouse restaurants one agreement calls for the operator to develop the restaurants in guatemala el salvador honduras nicaragua and costa rica the other agreement calls for the operator to develop the restaurants in peru we do not have an ownership interest in any of these franchisees but we receive royalty income under the area development and franchise agreements the amount of income we derive from our joint venture and franchise arrangements is not material to our consolidated financial statements 

we continue to explore additional avenues of new business development during fiscal 2012 we began selling olive gardens italian salad dressing and shredded cheese in sams club ®  stores across the country during fiscal 2013 we expanded the test to sell red lobster cheddar bay biscuit mix olive garden olive oil and olive gardens salad croutons in sams club stores and we began selling olive gardens salad dressing in walmart ®  stores the products will be sold at sams club and walmart stores exclusively for one year while we continue to evaluate this and other opportunities to market consumer packaged goods we also are researching and developing proprietary technology for lobster aquaculture farming construction of a pilot lobster hatchery should be completed next fiscal year 

seasonality 

our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally during fiscal 2013 our average sales per restaurant were highest in the spring and winter followed by the summer and lowest in the fall during fiscal 2012 and 2011 our average sales per restaurant were highest in the winter and spring followed by the summer and lowest in the fall holidays changes in the economy severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions because of the seasonality of our business results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

government regulation 

we are subject to various federal state local and international laws affecting our business each of our restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities which include health safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located the development and operation of restaurants depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites which are subject to zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations to date we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals 

during fiscal 2013  106 percent of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site in most cases on an annual basis and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time these regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant operation including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours of operation advertising wholesale purchasing inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages the failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these licenses would adversely affect the restaurant’s operations we also are subject in certain states to “dramshop” statutes which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person who then causes injury to himself or a third party we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance 

we also are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws governing such matters as overtime tip credits working conditions safety standards and hiring and employment practices changes in these laws during fiscal 2013  have not had a material effect on our operations 

we currently are operating under a tip rate alternative commitment “trac” agreement with the internal revenue service through increased educational and other efforts in the restaurants the trac agreement reduces the likelihood of potential chainwide employeronly fica assessments for unreported tips 

we are subject to federal and state environmental regulations but these rules have not had a material effect on our operations during fiscal 2013  there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated 

our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 “ada” and related state accessibility statutes under the ada and related state laws we must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment and when constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of our restaurants we must make those facilities accessible 

we are reviewing the health care reform law enacted by congress in march of 2010 “affordable care act” as part of that review we will evaluate the potential impacts of this new law on our business and accommodate various parts of the law as they take effect 

we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food including regulations regarding product safety nutritional content and menu labeling we are or may become subject to laws and regulations requiring disclosure of calorie fat trans fat salt and allergen content the affordable care act requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus the food and drug administration has proposed rules to implement this provision that would require restaurants to post the number of calories for most items on menus or menu boards and to make available more detailed nutrition information upon request 

we are subject to laws relating to information security privacy cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud an increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information including social security numbers financial information including credit card numbers and health information 

see item 1a “risk factors” below for a discussion of risks relating to federal state and local regulation of our business including in the areas of health care reform data privacy and environmental matters 

sustainability 

over the last several years we have come to see that our commitment to sustainability is a central part of achieving our larger purpose while we have long addressed various aspects of sustainability such as seafood stewardship in recent years we have strived to develop a more integrated and strategic approach to managing sustainability issues 

while global sustainability challenges necessitate a global response we understand their potential impact to us either through increased energy costs or commodity prices the depletion of certain species of seafood andor other disruptions to our food supply chain in this challenge we see opportunity conservation will be a competitive advantage  it will lower our operating costs insulate our supply chain help us attract and retain employees  all increasing the success of our business

risk factors 

tableend 

various risks and uncertainties could affect our business any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations therefore the following is not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

a failure to maintain food safety throughout the supply chain and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

food safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe quality food products however food safety issues could be caused at the point of source or by food suppliers or distributors and as a result be out of our control in addition regardless of the source or cause any report of foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination at one of our restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our brands and have a negative impact on our sales even instances of foodborne illness food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients resulting in higher costs and lower margins 

litigation including allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees guests suppliers shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation these actions and proceedings may involve allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices including wage and hour violations and employment discrimination guest discrimination food safety issues including poor food quality foodborne illness food tampering food contamination and adverse health effects from consumption of various food products or highcalorie foods including obesity other personal injury violation of “dram shop” laws providing an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or a third party trademark infringement violation of the federal securities laws or other concerns the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time the cost to defend litigation may be significant there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease guest acceptance of our brands regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are found liable litigation could impact our operations in other ways as well allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices for example could adversely affect employee acquisition and retention as a result litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable publicity or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could harm our reputation and adversely impact our guest counts and sales 

the good reputation of our restaurant brands is a key factor in the success of our business actual or alleged incidents at any of our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could harm our brands even incidents occurring at restaurants 

operated by our competitors or in the supply chain generally could result in negative publicity that could harm the restaurant industry overall and indirectly our own brands negative publicity may result from allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices employee dissatisfaction guest discrimination illness injury or any of the other matters discussed above that could give rise to litigation regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants or only to a single restaurant could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand negative publicity also may result from health concerns including food safety and flu outbreaks publication of government or industry findings concerning food products environmental disasters crime incidents data privacy breaches scandals involving our employees or operational problems at our restaurants all of which could make our brands and menu offerings less appealing to our guests and negatively impact our guest counts and sales adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of our brands or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to a number of risks relating to public policy changes and federal state and local regulation of our business including in the areas of health care reform environmental matters minimum wage unionization data privacy menu labeling immigration requirements and taxes and an insufficient or ineffective response to government regulation may impact our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability 

the restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal state local and international laws and regulations the development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites which are subject to building zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations and requirements we are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health sanitation safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food including regulations regarding product safety nutritional content and menu labeling we are subject to federal and state laws governing minimum wages unionization and other labor issues these include the fair labor standards act of 1938 and requirements concerning overtime paid or family leave tip credits working conditions and safety standards they also include the immigration reform and control act of 1986 which requires among other things the preparation of form i9 to verify that employees are authorized to accept employment in the united states 

we also are subject to federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities such as the ada compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation new or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our cost of labor 

the affordable care act was enacted in march 2010 we have continued to evaluate the potential impacts of this new law on our business and accommodate various parts of the law as they take effect we estimate that the costs associated with the next phase of the implementation of the affordable care act will impact our earnings in fiscal 2014 there are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can accommodate all of the costs associated with compliance we did not receive taxfree subsidies for providing prescription drugs to retirees under medicare part d therefore we have no deferred tax assets associated with our retiree medical plan that would be impacted by this law the affordable care act also requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus we do not expect to incur any material costs from compliance with this provision but cannot anticipate any changes in guest behavior resulting from the implementation of this portion of the law which could have an adverse effect on our sales or results of operations we are also reviewing the potential impacts of new laws associated with health care passed by various states 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge emission and disposal of hazardous materials there also has been increasing focus by us and overseas governmental authorities on other environmental matters such as climate change the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption this increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters such as the emission of greenhouse gases where “cap and trade” initiatives could effectively impose a tax on carbon emissions legislative regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials taxes transportation and utilities which could decrease our operating profits and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment 

we are subject to laws relating to information security privacy cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud an increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information including social security numbers financial information including credit card numbers and health information compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and any failure or perceived failure to comply with those laws could harm our reputation or lead to litigation which could adversely affect our financial condition 

the impact of current laws and regulations the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations or an insufficient or ineffective 

response to significant regulatory or public policy issues could increase our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal state and local authorities could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings 

we may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs 

our restaurant operations are subject to united states and canadian federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages working conditions overtime and tip credits as federal and state minimum wage rates increase we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage labor shortages increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs this in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales conversely if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices our profitability may decline in addition the current premiums that we pay for our insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property health and directors’ and officers’ liability may increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs the dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers’ compensation and general liability insurance for which we carry high perclaim deductibles may also increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs further the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses 

we rely heavily on information technology in our operations and insufficient guest or employee facing technology or a failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network free from material failure interruption or security breach could harm our ability to effectively operate our business andor result in the loss of respected relationships with our guests or employees 

we rely heavily on information systems across our operations including for marketing programs employee engagement management of our supply chain pointofsale processing system in our restaurants and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems a material network breach in the security of these systems as a result of a cyber attack or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to us or an individual this could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets or the improper use of personal information or other “identity theft” each of these situations or data privacy breaches may cause delays in guest service reduce efficiency in our operations require significant capital investments to remediate the problem or result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation 

our inability or failure to execute on a comprehensive business continuity plan following a major natural disaster such as a hurricane or manmade disaster including terrorism at our corporate facility could materially adversely impact our business 

many of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one florida location   we have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature including hurricanes and other natural disasters and back up and offsite locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information however if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans we may experience delays in recovery of data inability to perform vital corporate functions tardiness in required reporting and compliance failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims 

health concerns arising from foodrelated pandemics outbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

the united states and other countries have experienced or may experience in the future outbreaks of viruses such as norovirus avian flu or “sars” and h1n1 or “swine flu” or other diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy commonly known as “mad cow disease” to the extent that a virus or disease is foodborne or perceived to be foodborne future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product or could reduce public confidence in food handling andor public assembly for example health concerns relating to the consumption of beef or to specific events such as an outbreak of “mad cow disease” may adversely impact sales at longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille restaurants that offer beef as a primary menu item in addition public concern over avian flu may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry the inability to serve beef or poultrybased products would restrict our ability to provide a variety of menu items to our guests if we change a restaurant menu in response to such concerns we may lose guests who do not prefer the new menu and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new guest base to produce the sales needed to make the restaurant profitable we also may have different or additional competitors for our intended 

guests as a result of such a change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors if a virus is transmitted by human contact our employees or guests could become infected or could choose or be advised to avoid gathering in public places any of which could adversely affect our restaurant guest traffic and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level we also could be adversely affected if jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition and if we have an insufficient focus on competition and the consumer landscape our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

the full service dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing service location personnel and type and quality of food and there are many wellestablished competitors we compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locallyowned restaurants we also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services particularly in the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section we compete primarily on the quality variety and value perception of menu items the number and location of restaurants type of brand quality and efficiency of service attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors we anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors if we are unable to continue to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our failure to drive both shortterm and longterm profitable sales growth through brand relevance operating excellence opening new restaurants of existing brands and developing or acquiring new dining brands could result in poor financial performance 

as part of our business strategy we intend to drive profitable sales growth by increasing samerestaurant sales at existing restaurants continuing to expand our current portfolio of restaurant brands and developing or acquiring additional brands that can be expanded profitably this strategy involves numerous risks and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives 

at existing brands we may not be able to maintain brand relevance and restaurant operating excellence to achieve sustainable samerestaurant sales growth and warrant new unit growth existing brand shortterm sales growth could be impacted if we are unable to drive near term guest count growth and longterm sales growth could be impacted if we fail to extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to our guests a failure to define and deliver clear relevant brands that generate sustainable samerestaurant traffic growth and produce nontraditional sales and earnings growth opportunities or to evolve inrestaurant and brand support cost structures so that competitively strong sales growth results in stable and improving profit margins could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition we may not be able to support sustained new unit growth or open all of our planned new restaurants and the new restaurants that we open may not be profitable or as profitable as our existing restaurants new restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize and even sales at successful newlyopened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation the opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on sales levels at existing restaurants 

the ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations the need to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses on a timely basis the need to comply with other regulatory requirements the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay construction increases in labor and building material costs the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms changes in weather or other acts of god that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions at each potential location we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites construction contractors management personnel hourly employees and other resources if we are unable to successfully manage these risks we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated sales and earnings in future periods 

we also may not be able to identify acquire and integrate additional brands or develop new business opportunities that are as profitable as our existing restaurants growth through acquisitions may involve additional risks for example we may pay too much for a brand relative to the actual economic return be required to borrow funds to make our acquisition which would increase our interest expense or be unable to successfully integrate an acquired brand into our operations 

failure to successfully integrate the yard house business and the additional indebtedness incurred to finance the yard house acquisition could adversely impact our stock price and future business and operations 

on august 29 2012 we acquired yard house our integration of yard houses business into our operations is a complex and timeconsuming process that may not be successful the primary areas of focus for successfully combining the business of yard house with our operations may include among others retaining and integrating management and other key employees integrating information communications and other systems and managing the growth of the combined company 

  

even if we successfully integrate the business of yard house into our operations there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits we acquired yard house with the expectation that the acquisition would result in various benefits for the combined company including among others business and growth opportunities and significant synergies from increased efficiency in purchasing distribution and other restaurant and corporate support increased competition andor deterioration in business conditions may limit our ability to expand this business as such we may not be able to realize the synergies goodwill business opportunities and growth prospects anticipated in connection with the acquisition 

the acquisition of yard house created a consolidated indebtedness greater than our indebtedness prior to the acquisition the increased indebtedness and higher debttoequity ratio of our company may have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs our level of indebtedness could have important consequences for example it may require a portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal of and interest on our indebtedness thus reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures and general corporate requirements and limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures additional acquisitions or general corporate requirements particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations are revised downward 

our plans to expand our smaller brands bahama breeze seasons 52 and eddie vs and the testing of synergy restaurants and other new business ventures that have not yet proven their longterm viability may not be successful which could require us to make substantial further investments in those brands and new business ventures and result in losses and impairments 

while each of our restaurant brands as well as each of our individual restaurants are subject to the risks and uncertainties described above there is an enhanced level of risk and uncertainty related to the operation and expansion of our smaller brands such as bahama breeze seasons 52 and eddie vs and the testing of new restaurant formats such as synergy restaurants and lobster aquaculture farming activities these brands test formats and new business ventures have not yet proven their longterm viability or growth potential we have made substantial investments in the development and expansion of each of these brands and test formats and further investment is required while we have implemented a number of changes to operations at bahama breeze and believe we have improved the guest experience and unit economics sufficiently to restart modest unit growth there can be no assurance that these changes will continue to be successful or that additional new unit growth will occur seasons 52 and eddie vs also are in the early stages of their development and will require additional resources to support further growth our other new business initiatives such as the sale of consumer packaged goods and lobster aquaculture farming have not yet proved their longterm viability and may not be successful 

in each case these brands and formats will continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties that accompany any emerging restaurant brand or format 

a lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

the success of our restaurants depends in large part on their locations as demographic and economic patterns change current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations in addition desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation the occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may experience higherthananticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants we incur substantial preopening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close relocate or remodel existing restaurants the expenses of opening closing relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated an increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

a failure to identify and execute innovative marketing and guest relationship tactics ineffective or improper use of other marketing initiatives and increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

if our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions if our advertising media or marketing expenses increase or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors or if we do not adequately leverage technology and data analytic capabilities needed to generate concise competitive insight we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations a failure to sufficiently innovate develop guest relationship initiatives or maintain adequate and effective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales 

as part of our marketing efforts we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain guests and will begin efforts to consolidate our brands into a single digital technology platform these initiatives may not be successful and pose a variety of other risks as discussed below under the heading our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could materially adversely impact our business 

a failure to recruit develop and retain effective leaders the loss or shortage of personnel with key capacities and skills or an inability to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

our future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other employees our future growth also depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain highquality employees to work in and manage our restaurants we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees in order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth a failure to maintain appropriate organizational capacity and capability to support leadership excellence adequate resources innovative skill sets and expectations and build adequate bench strength required for growth a loss of key employees or a significant shortage of highquality restaurant employees and an inability to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction which could lead to poor guest satisfaction higher turnover litigation and unionization which could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

a failure to address cost pressures including rising costs for commodities health care and utilities used by our restaurants and a failure to effectively deliver cost management activities and achieve economies of scale in purchasing could compress our margins and adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food ingredients health care utilities unemployment and other related costs over which we may have little control operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities including shrimp lobster crab and other seafood as well as beef pork chicken cheese and produce the introduction of or changes to tariffs on imported shrimp or other food products could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products we attempt to leverage our size to achieve economies of scale in purchasing but there can be no assurances that we can always do so effectively we are subject to the general risks of inflation our restaurants’ operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as electricity and natural gas whether as a result of inflation or otherwise on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply in addition interruptions to the availability of gas electric water or other utilities whether due to aging infrastructure weather conditions fire animal damage trees digging accidents or other reasons largely out of our control may adversely affect our operations our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may lose sales or incur increased costs if our restaurants experience shortages or interruptions in the delivery of food and other products from our third party vendors and suppliers 

shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants may be caused by inclement weather natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods droughts and earthquakes the inability of our vendors to obtain credit in a tightened credit market or remain solvent given disruptions in the financial markets or other conditions beyond our control such shortages or interruptions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants we may have a limited number of suppliers for certain of our products supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our restaurant operations if we raise prices as a result of increased food costs or shortages it may negatively impact our sales if we temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular items from a restaurant’s menu that restaurant may experience a significant reduction in sales during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our guests changing their dining habits 

adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could adversely affect our restaurant sales 

adverse weather conditions can impact guest traffic at our restaurants cause the temporary underutilization of outdoor patio seating and in more severe cases such as hurricanes tornadoes or other natural disasters cause temporary closures sometimes for prolonged periods which would negatively impact our restaurant sales changes in weather could result in construction delays interruptions to the availability of utilities and shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies which 

could increase our costs some climatologists predict that the longterm effects of climate change and global warming may result in more severe volatile weather or extended droughts which could increase the frequency of weather impacts on our operations 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to hedge exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we use or may use derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs including but not limited to coffee butter wheat soybean oil pork beef diesel fuel gasoline and natural gas changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings included in our consolidated financial statements we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and other general macroeconomic factors including unemployment energy prices and interest rates that are largely out of our control may adversely affect consumer behavior and our results of operations 

our business results depend on a number of industryspecific and general economic factors many of which are beyond our control the full service dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in international national regional and local economic conditions seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant brands the performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends severe weather including hurricanes traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants 

general economic conditions may also adversely affect our results of operations recessionary economic cycles a protracted economic slowdown a worsening economy increased unemployment increased energy prices rising interest rates a downgrade of the us governments longterm credit rating the european debt crisis or other industrywide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings job losses foreclosures bankruptcies and falling home prices could cause guests to make fewer discretionary purchases and any significant decrease in our guest traffic or average profit per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance in addition if gasoline natural gas electricity and other energy costs increase and credit card home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine out may spend less on each dining out occasion or may choose more inexpensive restaurants 

furthermore we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts terrorist attacks efforts to combat terrorism heightened security requirements or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems could have on our operations the economy or consumer confidence generally any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures 

unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our guests could increase our costs reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact consumer spending patterns affect the availability and cost of credit and increase pension plan expenses 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control global credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil over the last few years characterized by the bankruptcy failure or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states and other governments these events may adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future there can be no assurances that we will be able to arrange credit on terms we believe are acceptable or that permit us to finance our business with historical margins the lack of credit along with the macroeconomic factors previously discussed may have an adverse impact on certain of our suppliers landlords and other tenants in retail centers in which we are located if these issues continue or worsen they could further materially impact these parties which in turn could negatively affect our financial results any new or continuing disruptions in the financial markets may also adversely affect the us and world economy which could negatively impact consumer spending patterns there can be no assurances as to how or when this period of turmoil will be resolved changes in the capital markets could also have significant effects on our pension plan our pension income or expense is affected by factors including the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for the pension plans for some of our employees the weighted average asset allocation and longterm rate of return of our pension plan assets the discount rate used to determine the service and interest cost components of our net periodic pension cost and assumed rates 

of increase in our employees’ future compensation if our pension plan assets do not achieve positive rates of return or if our estimates and assumed rates are not accurate our earnings may decrease because net periodic pension costs would rise and we could be required to provide additional funds to cover our obligations to employees under the pension plan 

we face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees business partners and vendors in foreign markets 

our expansion into international markets could create risks to our brands and reputation we believe that we have selected highcaliber international operating partners and franchisees with significant experience in restaurant operations and provide them with training and support however the probability of opening ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee if the franchisee does not successfully open or operate its restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards or guests have negative experiences due to issues with food quality or operational execution our brand values could suffer which could have an adverse effect on our business 

there also is no assurance that international operations will be profitable or that international growth will continue our international operations are subject to all of the same risks associated with our domestic operations as well as a number of additional risks these include among other things international economic and political conditions foreign currency fluctuations and differing cultures and consumer preferences 

we also are subject to governmental regulations throughout the world that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees vendors and conduct our affairs with lobster aquaculture farming these include antitrust and tax requirements antiboycott regulations importexportcustoms regulations and other international trade regulations the usa patriot act the foreign corrupt practices act and applicable local law failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business 

we regard our darden ®  darden restaurants ®  olive garden ®  red lobster ®  longhorn steakhouse ®  the capital grille ®  yard house ®  bahama breeze ®  seasons 52 ®  eddie vs prime seafood ®  and wildfish seafood grille ®  service marks and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts copyrights patents trademarks service marks and other common law rights such as trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our restaurants and services from infringement we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the united states and foreign jurisdictions however we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other persons although our policy is to oppose any such infringement further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources 

impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired we test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit if the carrying value is less than the fair value no impairment exists if the carrying value is higher than the fair value there is an indication of impairment a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment exists factors may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and slower growth rates any adverse change in these factors would have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations we compute the amount of impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we are required to record a noncash impairment charge if the testing performed indicates that goodwill has been impaired 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets primarily the longhorn steakhouse ®  the capital grille ®  yard house ® and eddie vs prime seafood ®  trademarks to determine if they are definite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory 

environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

as with goodwill we test our indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable we estimate the fair value of the trademarks based on an income valuation model using the relief from royalty method which requires assumptions related to projected sales from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademarks and a discount rate 

we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

failure of our internal controls over financial reporting and future changes in accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results affect our reported results of operations or otherwise harm our business and financial results 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud our growth and acquisition of other restaurant companies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud a significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock 

a change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future changes to existing accounting rules or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our reported financial results additionally our assumptions estimates and judgments related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including but not limited to revenue recognition fair value of investments impairment of longlived assets leases and related economic transactions derivatives pension and postretirement benefits intangibles selfinsurance income taxes property and equipment unclaimed property laws and litigation and stockbased compensation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by us changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance 

our inability or failure to recognize respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could materially adversely impact our business 

  there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices including weblogs blogs social media websites and other forms of internetbased communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants can post often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate each of which may harm our performance prospects or business the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction the dissemination of information online could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations regardless of the informations accuracy 

  

as part of our marketing efforts we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms such as facebook® and twitter® to attract and retain guests we also are initiating a multiyear effort to implement new technology platforms that should allow us to digitally engage with our guests and employees and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities these initiatives may not be successful resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues or increased employee engagement in addition a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media including the improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about our company exposure of personally identifiable information fraud or outofdate information the inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation

of these 2138  restaurants open on may 26 2013  1048 were located on owned sites and 1090 were located on leased sites the leases are classified as follows 



properties – general 

during fiscal 1999 we formed two subsidiary corporations each of which elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust “reit” under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code these elections limit the activities of both corporations to holding certain real estate assets the formation of these two reits is designed primarily to assist us in managing our real estate portfolio and possibly to provide a vehicle to access capital markets in the future both reits were structured as nonpublic reits 

during fiscal 2013 we merged one of the reit entities into another subsidiary of darden restaurants inc as a result of this merger all restaurant property that was previously owned by the merged reit was returned to darden corporate entities that operate the corresponding restaurants at the sites the second reit remains in existence at the end of fiscal 2013 and continues to operate as a nonpublic reit through our subsidiary companies we indirectly own 100 percent of all voting stock and greater than 995 percent of the total value of the reit for financial reporting purposes the reit is included in our consolidated financial statements 

in connection with the sale and lease back of our former restaurant support center buildings we purchased several adjacent parcels of vacant land in orange county florida and relocated our headquarters to this site during the second quarter of fiscal 2010 the site includes a main headquarters building data center and parking deck the restaurant support center campus at this new location offers a more collaborative and unified environment with additional room for future growth during fiscal year 2013 we commenced the first phase of hotelretail development on the adjacent parcels of land to our restaurant support center buildings the first phase of hotelretail development includes construction of a 128room hotel by an unaffiliated third party hotel operator the hotel will serve as lodging headquarters for those attending training sessions at our restaurant support center

 strategy 

the restaurant industry is generally considered to be comprised of two segments quick service and full service the full service segment is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains we believe that capable operators of strong multiunit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the full service segment we believe we have strong brands and that the breadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the full service restaurant industry this collective capability is the product of investments over many years in areas that are critical to success in our business including brand management excellence restaurant operations excellence supply chain talent management and information technology among other things 

to support future growth we are striving to change in two important ways we are modifying our organizational structure so we can better leverage our existing experience and expertise and we are adding new expertise in additional areas that are critical to future success in the past two years we have created enterpriselevel marketing and restaurant operations units and established forwardlooking strategy units in our finance and information technology functions we have initiatives focusing on our specialty restaurant group enterpriselevel sales building digital guest and employee engagement health and wellness and centers of excellence we plan to grow by leveraging our expertise and new capabilities to increase samerestaurant sales increase the 

number of restaurants in each of our existing brands and develop or acquire additional brands that can be expanded profitably we also continue to pursue other avenues of new business development including franchising our restaurants outside of the us and canada testing synergy restaurants and other formats to expand our brands and selling consumer packaged goods such as olive garden salad dressing 

the total sales growth we envision should increase the costeffectiveness of our support platform however we also plan to supplement our conventional incremental yeartoyear cost management efforts with an ongoing focus on identifying and pursuing transformational multiyear cost reduction opportunities in fiscal 2013 we plan to continue to implement the four transformational initiatives that were our focus last year  further automating our supply chain significantly reducing the use of energy water and cleaning supplies in our restaurants centralizing management of our restaurant facilities and optimizing labor costs within our restaurants 

while we are a leader in the full service dining segment we know we cannot be successful without a clear sense of who we are ours is a people business and our core purpose is “to nourish and delight everyone we serve” this core purpose is supported by our core values 

  

 

our mission is to be “the best now and for generations and a place where people can achieve their dreams” we feel we have a compelling opportunity to create a company thats more valuable and valued  a company that matters we believe we can achieve this goal by continuing to build on our strategy to be a brandbuilding company which is focused on

synergy restaurants 

in march 2011 we opened a test “synergy restaurant” that houses both a red lobster and olive garden restaurant in the same building but with separate front doors dining rooms and brandspecific menus the shared building is designed to keep the guest experience the same while delivering cost efficiencies we developed this concept to test expansion into smaller markets that would not meet our population density requirements to build a single brand future synergy restaurants may not be limited to red lobster and olive garden combinations but could involve our other brands as well we opened a second synergy test location during fiscal 2012 

recent and planned restaurant growth 

during fiscal 2012  we opened 89 net new restaurants in the us and canada our actual and projected net new openings in the us and canada from continuing operations by brand are shown below 



1 excludes acquisition of 11 eddie vs restaurants during fiscal 2012 

the actual number of openings for each of our brands will depend on many factors including our ability to locate appropriate sites negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms obtain necessary local governmental permits complete construction and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel our objective is to continue to expand all of our restaurant brands and to develop or acquire additional brands that can be expanded profitably we continue to test new ideas and brands and also to evaluate potential acquisition candidates to assess whether they would satisfy our strategic and financial objectives 

in connection with our growth objectives on july 12 2012 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire yard house usa inc “yard house” for 585 million in an allcash transaction yard house which launched its first restaurant in 1996 now has 39 restaurants across 13 states and offers contemporary american cuisine with chefinspired recipes and ethnic flavors along with a wide range of draft beers and other beverages in a stylish and energetic setting the brand is expected to become part of our specialty restaurant group and the merger which is subject to certain conditions including clearance under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 the “hartscott act” and customary closing conditions is expected to be completed early in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 

we consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant’s longterm success and we devote significant effort to the site selection process prior to entering a market we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors these factors include trade area demographics such as target population density and household income levels competitive influences in the trade area the site’s visibility accessibility and traffic volume and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls hotelmotel complexes offices and universities members of senior management evaluate inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after permits are obtained and the site is acquired 

the following table illustrates the approximate average capital investment size and dining capacity of the 8 red lobster restaurants six new restaurants and two relocations 38 olive garden restaurants 38 new restaurants and no relocations and the 34 longhorn steakhouse restaurants 34 new restaurants and no relocations opened during fiscal 2012  the table excludes any rebuilt restaurants 



 we systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards when a restaurant falls below minimum standards we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes and implement marketing and operational plans to improve that restaurant’s performance if performance does not improve to acceptable levels the restaurant is evaluated for relocation closing or conversion to one of our other brands 

during fiscal 2010 we permanently closed three red lobster and three longhorn steakhouse restaurants during fiscal 2011 we permanently closed one red lobster two olive garden and two longhorn steakhouse restaurants during fiscal 2012 we permanently closed one red lobster and two longhorn steakhouse restaurants permanent closures are typically due to economic changes in trade areas the expiration of lease agreements or site concerns accordingly we continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges 

restaurant operations 

we believe that highquality restaurant management is critical to our longterm success our restaurant management structure varies by brand and restaurant size we issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards 

each typical red lobster and olive garden restaurant is led by a general manager and each longhorn steakhouse restaurant is led by a managing partner each also has three to five additional managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant in addition each restaurant typically employs 50 to185 hourly employees most of whom work parttime restaurant general managers or managing partners report to a director of operations who is responsible for approximately six to ten restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by all levels of supervision to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards 

each bahama breeze restaurant is led by a general manager and each the capital grille seasons 52 and eddie vs restaurant is led by a managing partner each also has one to four assistant managers each the capital grille seasons 52 and eddie vs restaurant has one to three chefs and each bahama breeze restaurant has one to three kitchen managers in addition each restaurant typically employs 50 to 185 hourly employees most of whom work parttime the general manager or managing partner of each restaurant reports directly to a director of operations who has operational responsibility for approximately three to ten restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by all levels of supervision to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards 

our learning center of excellence in partnership with each brand’s head of training together with senior operations executives are responsible for developing and maintaining our operations training programs these efforts include a 12 to 15week training program for management trainees 8 to 9 weeks in the case of internal promotions and continuing development programs for managers supervisors and directors the emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant brand but includes leadership restaurant business management and culinary skills we also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants including deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations the opening training teams typically begin work one and a half weeks prior to opening and remain at the new restaurant for up to three weeks after the opening they are redeployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant’s operating staff 

at the level above director of operations we are implementing a new operations leadership structure at red lobster olive garden and longhorn steakhouse we are adding new leadership roles between our directors of operations and our senior vice 

presidents of operations these new roles  regional vice president or managing director  will each report to a senior vice president of operations and help further strengthen our restaurant operations expertise by elevating the execution required to build guest loyalty and enhance our talent development capacity in the field this change also reduces the span of control for our senior vice presidents of operations allowing them to focus on identifying new tools support and operations strategies required to sustainably grow guest counts and sales in their particular division and better enable talent rotation and sharing across our brands 

we maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our managementlevel employees we believe that our leadership position strong successoriented culture and various shortterm and longterm incentive programs including stock and stockbased compensation help attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers 

quality assurance 

our total quality department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe highquality food in a clean and safe environment through rigorous physical evaluation and testing at our north american laboratories and through “point source inspection” by our international team of quality specialists in several foreign countries we purchase only seafood that meets or exceeds our specifications we use independent third parties to inspect and evaluate commodity vendors in addition any commodity supplier that produces a “highrisk” product is subject to a food safety evaluation by darden personnel at least annually we require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive hazard analysis and critical control point “haccp” food safety programs adopted by the us food and drug administration the haccp programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause foodborne illnesses by applying scientificallybased controls to analyze hazards identify and monitor critical control points and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met since 1976 we have required routine microbiological testing of seafood and other commodities for quality and microbiological safety in addition our total quality managers and third party auditors visit each restaurant periodically throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation the total quality managers also serve as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety 

purchasing and distribution 

our ability to ensure a consistent supply of highquality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant brands depends on reliable sources of procurement our purchasing staff sources negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 2000 suppliers whose products originate in more than 30 countries suppliers must meet various of our requirements and strict quality control standards in the development harvest catch and production of food products competitive bids longterm contracts and longterm vendor relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products 

we believe that our seafood purchasing capabilities are a significant competitive advantage our purchasing staff travels routinely within the united states and internationally to source more than 100 varieties of topquality seafood at competitive prices we believe that we have established excellent longterm relationships with key seafood vendors and usually source our product directly from producers not brokers or middlemen while the supply of certain seafood species is volatile we believe we have the ability to identify alternative seafood products and to adjust our menus as necessary 

all other essential food products are available or can be made available upon short notice from alternative qualified suppliers  we continue to progress in automating our supply chain allowing our suppliers logistics partners and distributors to improve optimization with information visibility through our subsidiary darden direct distribution inc and unique longterm agreements with our third party national distribution companies we maintain inventory ownership in dedicated environments where practical darden direct further enables our purchasing staff to integrate demand forecasts into longterm agreements driving efficiencies in production economics when we collaborate with vendors we continue to invest in new technologies to improve our purchasing and restaurant operations during fiscal 2012 we completed the implementation of “ikitchen” a webbased software system to our regional suppliers the system is designed to more efficiently handle restaurant product orders receiving invoice approval and inventories this improves the ability of our logistics infrastructure to replenish restaurants with the right products at the right price and with justintime delivery because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales 

our supplier diversity program is an integral part of our purchasing efforts through this program we identify minority and womenowned vendors and assist them in establishing supplier relationships with us we are committed to the development and growth of minority and womenowned enterprises and during fiscal 2012  we spent approximately 59 percent and 36 percent respectively of our purchasing dollars with those firms 

advertising and marketing 

we believe we have developed significant marketing and advertising capabilities our size enables us to be a leading advertiser in the full service dining segment of the restaurant industry red lobster and olive garden leverage the efficiency of national network television advertising olive garden supplements this with cable local television and digital advertising and red lobster with cable and digital advertising longhorn steakhouse currently uses local television advertising and began national cable television advertising in fiscal 2011 the capital grille bahama breeze seasons 52 and eddie vs do not use national television advertising our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to attract guests we implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase our sales and profits as well as strengthen our brands we also rely on outdoor billboard direct mail and email advertising as well as radio newspapers digital coupons search engine marketing and social media such as facebook ®  and twitter ®  as appropriate to attract and retain guests during fiscal 2012 olive garden red lobster and longhorn steakhouse launched electronic gift cards that can be ordered on our brand websites and sent instantly online buyers can personalize these egift cards by recording their voices attaching photos and letting facebook friends know they have bought a card we have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor guest satisfaction and evolving expectations

information technology

olive garden and longhorn steakhouse restaurants in the middle east the agreement calls for the operator to develop a minimum of 60 restaurants in bahrain egypt kuwait lebanon qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emirates over the next five years as of may 27 2012  one restaurant a red lobster in dubai had opened under this agreement in august 2011 we entered into an agreement with a third party restaurant operator to develop and operate red lobster olive garden and the capital grille brands in mexico the agreement calls for the operator to initially develop a minimum of 37 restaurants in mexico over the next five years as of may 27 2012 no restaurants had as yet opened under this agreement we do not have an ownership interest in any of these franchisees but we receive royalty income under the area development and franchise agreements the amount of income we derive from our joint venture and franchise arrangements is not material to our consolidated financial statements 

we continue to explore additional avenues of new business development during fiscal 2012 we began selling olive gardens italian salad dressing and shredded cheese in sams club ®  stores across the country the products will be sold at sams club stores exclusively for one year while we continue to evaluate this and other opportunities to market consumer packaged goods we also are researching and developing proprietary technology for aquaculture lobster farming construction of a pilot hatchery in malaysia should begin next fiscal year 

seasonality 

our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally during each of fiscal years 2012  2011 and 2010 our average sales per restaurant were highest in the winter and spring followed by the summer and lowest in the fall holidays changes in the economy severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions because of the seasonality of our business results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

government regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws affecting our business each of our restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities which include health safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located the development and operation of restaurants depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites which are subject to zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations to date we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals 

during fiscal 2012  95 percent of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site in most cases on an annual basis and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time these regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant operation including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours of operation advertising wholesale purchasing inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages the failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these licenses would adversely affect the restaurant’s operations we also are subject in certain states to “dramshop” statutes which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person who then causes injury to himself or a third party we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance 

we also are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws governing such matters as overtime tip credits working conditions safety standards and hiring and employment practices changes in these laws during fiscal 2012  have not had a material effect on our operations 

we currently are operating under a tip rate alternative commitment “trac” agreement with the internal revenue service through increased educational and other efforts in the restaurants the trac agreement reduces the likelihood of potential chainwide employeronly fica assessments for unreported tips 

we are subject to federal and state environmental regulations but these rules have not had a material effect on our operations during fiscal 2012  there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated 

our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 “ada” and related state accessibility statutes under the ada and related state laws we must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment and when constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of our restaurants we must make those facilities accessible 

we are reviewing the health care reform law enacted by congress in march of 2010 “health care reform law” as part of that review we will evaluate the potential impacts of this new law on our business and accommodate various parts of the law as they take effect 

we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food including regulations regarding product safety nutritional content and menu labeling we are or may become subject to laws and regulations requiring disclosure of calorie 

fat trans fat salt and allergen content the health care reform law requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus the food and drug administration has proposed rules to implement this provision that would require restaurants to post the number of calories for most items on menus or menu boards and to make available more detailed nutrition information upon request 

we are subject to laws relating to information security privacy cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud an increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information including social security numbers financial information including credit card numbers and health information 

see item 1a “risk factors” below for a discussion of risks relating to federal state and local regulation of our business including in the areas of health care reform data privacy and environmental matters 

sustainability 

over the last several years we have come to see that our commitment to sustainability is a central part of achieving our larger purpose while we have long addressed various aspects of sustainability such as seafood stewardship in recent years we have strived to develop a more integrated and strategic approach to managing sustainability issues 

first we know having clear governance and accountability mechanisms are essential to meeting our sustainability commitments leadership for our sustainability strategy and commitments resides at three levels board of directors executive leadership and senior management we coordinate implementation of our sustainability strategy stakeholder engagement and communications through a small team within our government and community affairs department our sustainability leadership council consists of executives from most brands and business units including operations supply chain human resources and business development three crossfunctional teams are tasked with developing and managing specific sustainability initiatives energy water and waste supply chain and operations culture 

second our business fundamentally relies on natural resources from the energy we use to light cool and heat our restaurants to the water we use to cook and clean to drive performance we set ambitious targets we committed to reduce our per restaurant energy and water use 15 percent by 2015 and over time send zero waste to landfill since fiscal 2008 we have reduced per restaurant energy usage by almost 8 and water by 17 percent additionally at our restaurant support center rsc in orlando leed gold we unveiled a 11 megawatt solar panel installation the largest private solar array in florida which generates 15 to 20 percent of the rscs annual energy demands we also reduced packaging and paper use in our kitchens recycled 100 percent of our yellow grease and expanded cardboard and singlestream recycling in over 50 percent and 30 percent of restaurants respectively and through darden harvest donated over 10 million pounds of food in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 bringing our total to 56 million pounds since 2004 

third as a restaurant company we rely on healthy marine and agricultural ecosystems to provide the ingredients we use to serve over 423 million meals each year thats why over the past few years one of our key areas of focus has been to understand and manage sustainability issues in our supply chain and explore how we can use our scale and influence as a catalyst for positive change weve established expectations for and regularly engage our suppliers on a range of sustainability issues including the launch of a supplier packaging optimization program addressed human and labor rights through our supplier code of conduct advanced seafood sustainability through our sustainable fisheries mission and gaa certification requirements and addressed concerns through our animal welfare working group by establishing clear principles and supporting grants for research one example was our announcement at the clinton global initiatives annual meeting in september 2011 to rebuild troubled fisheries through fishery improvement projects in and around the gulf of mexico with partners publix super markets and the sustainable fisheries partnership 

while global sustainability challenges necessitate a global response we understand their potential impact to us either through increased energy costs or commodity prices the depletion of certain species of seafood andor other disruptions to our food supply chain in this challenge we see opportunity conservation will be a competitive advantage  it will lower our operating costs insulate our supply chain help us attract and retain employees  all increasing the success of our business 

more information about our sustainability strategy how we are implementing that strategy and our progress to date is available through our sustainability report available on our website at wwwdardencomsustainability 

health and wellness 

in september 2011 we announced a comprehensive health and wellness commitment to reduce our calorie and sodium footprints and to provide greater choice and variety on our childrens menus we were joined at an olive garden restaurant in 

hyattsville maryland by first lady michelle obama and the partnership for a healthier america to announce our commitment across our brands we are working toward a 10 percent reduction of calories and sodium over five years and a 20 percent reduction of calories and sodium over 10 years and we are establishing specific nutrition standards to guide the development of our childrens meals to simplify parents search for healthier options that their children enjoy

risk factors 

tableend 

various risks and uncertainties could affect our business any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations therefore the following is not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

a failure to maintain food safety throughout the supply chain and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business 

food safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe quality food products however food safety issues could be caused at the point of source or by food suppliers or distributors and as a result be out of our control in addition regardless of the source or cause any report of foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination at one of our restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our brands and have a negative impact on our sales even instances of foodborne illness food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients resulting in higher costs and lower margins 

litigation including allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees guests suppliers shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation these actions and proceedings may involve allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices including wage and hour violations and employment discrimination guest discrimination food safety issues including poor food quality foodborne illness food tampering food contamination and adverse health effects from consumption of various food products or highcalorie foods including obesity other personal injury violation of “dram shop” laws providing an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or a third party trademark infringement violation of the federal securities laws or other concerns the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time the cost to defend litigation may be significant there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease guest acceptance of our brands regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are found liable litigation could impact our operations in other ways as well allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices for example could adversely affect employee acquisition and retention as a result litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable publicity or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could harm our reputation and adversely impact our guest counts and sales 

the good reputation of our restaurant brands is a key factor in the success of our business actual or alleged incidents at any of our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could harm our brands even incidents occurring at restaurants operated by our competitors or in the supply chain generally could result in negative publicity that could harm the restaurant industry overall and indirectly our own brands negative publicity may result from allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices guest discrimination illness injury or any of the other matters discussed above that could give rise to litigation regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants or only to a single restaurant could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand negative publicity also may result from health concerns including food safety and flu outbreaks publication of government or industry findings concerning food products environmental disasters crime incidents data privacy breaches scandals involving our employees or operational problems at our restaurants all of which could make our brands and menu offerings less appealing to our guests and negatively impact our guest counts and sales adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of our brands or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to a number of risks relating to public policy changes and federal state and local regulation of our business including in the areas of health care reform environmental matters minimum wage unionization data privacy menu labeling immigration requirements and taxes and an insufficient or ineffective response to government regulation may impact our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability 

the restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations the development and operation 

of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites which are subject to building zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations and requirements we are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health sanitation safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food including regulations regarding product safety nutritional content and menu labeling we are subject to federal and state laws governing minimum wages unionization and other labor issues these include the fair labor standards act of 1938 and requirements concerning overtime paid or family leave tip credits working conditions and safety standards they also include the immigration reform and control act of 1986 which requires among other things the preparation of form i9 to verify that employees are authorized to accept employment in the united states 

we also are subject to federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities such as the ada compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation new or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our cost of labor 

we are reviewing the health care reform law as part of that review we will evaluate the potential impacts of this new law on our business and accommodate various parts of the law as they take effect there are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can accommodate all of the costs associated with compliance we did not receive taxfree subsidies for providing prescription drugs to retirees under medicare part d therefore we have no deferred tax assets associated with our retiree medical plan that would be impacted by this law the health care reform law also requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus we do not expect to incur any material costs from compliance with this provision but cannot anticipate any changes in guest behavior resulting from the implementation of this portion of the law which could have an adverse effect on our sales or results of operations 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge emission and disposal of hazardous materials there also has been increasing focus by us and overseas governmental authorities on other environmental matters such as climate change the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption this increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters such as the emission of greenhouse gases where “cap and trade” initiatives could effectively impose a tax on carbon emissions legislative regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials taxes transportation and utilities which could decrease our operating profits and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment 

we are subject to laws relating to information security privacy cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud an increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information including social security numbers financial information including credit card numbers and health information compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and any failure or perceived failure to comply with those laws could harm our reputation or lead to litigation which could adversely affect our financial condition 

the impact of current laws and regulations the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues could increase our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal state and local authorities could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings 

we may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs 

our restaurant operations are subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages working conditions overtime and tip credits as federal and state minimum wage rates increase we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage labor shortages increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs this in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales conversely if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices our profitability may decline in addition the current premiums that we pay for our insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property health and directors’ and officers’ liability may increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs the dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers’ compensation and general liability insurance for which we carry high perclaim deductibles may also increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs further the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses 

we rely heavily on information technology in our operations and insufficient guest or employee facing technology or a failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network free from material failure interruption or security breach could harm our ability to effectively operate our business andor result in the loss of respected relationships with our guests or employees 

we rely heavily on information systems across our operations including for marketing programs employee engagement management of our supply chain pointofsale processing system in our restaurants and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems a material network breach in the security of these systems as a result of a cyber attack or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to us or an individual this could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets or the improper use of personal information or other “identity theft” each of these situations or data privacy breaches may cause delays in guest service reduce efficiency in our operations require significant capital investments to remediate the problem or result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation 

as part of our marketing efforts we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms such as facebook ®  and twitter ® to attract and retain guests we also are initiating a multiyear effort to implement new technology platforms that should allow us to digitally engage with our guests and employees and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities these initiatives may not be successful resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues or increased employee engagement in addition a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media including the improper disclosure of proprietary information negative comments about our company exposure of personally identifiable information fraud or outofdate information the inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation 

our inability or failure to execute on a comprehensive business continuity plan following a major natural disaster such as a hurricane or manmade disaster including terrorism at our corporate facility could materially adversely impact our business 

many of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one florida location   we have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature including hurricanes and other natural disasters and back up and offsite locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information however if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans we may experience delays in recovery of data inability to perform vital corporate functions tardiness in required reporting and compliance failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims 

health concerns arising from foodrelated pandemics outbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

the united states and other countries have experienced or may experience in the future outbreaks of viruses such as norovirus avian flu or “sars” and h1n1 or “swine flu” or other diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy commonly known as “mad cow disease” to the extent that a virus or disease is foodborne or perceived to be foodborne future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product or could reduce public confidence in food handling andor public assembly for example health concerns relating to the consumption of beef or to specific events such as an outbreak of “mad cow disease” may adversely impact sales at longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille restaurants that offer beef as a primary menu item in addition public concern over avian flu may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry the inability to serve beef or poultrybased products would restrict our ability to provide a variety of menu items to our guests if we change a restaurant menu in response to such concerns we may lose guests who do not prefer the new menu and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new guest base to produce the sales needed to make the restaurant profitable we also may have different or additional competitors for our intended guests as a result of such a change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors if a virus is transmitted by human contact our employees or guests could become infected or could choose or be advised to avoid gathering in public places any of which could adversely affect our restaurant guest traffic and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level we also could be adversely affected if jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition and if we have an insufficient focus on competition and the consumer landscape our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

the full service dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing service location 

personnel and type and quality of food and there are many wellestablished competitors we compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locallyowned restaurants we also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services particularly in the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section we compete primarily on the quality variety and value perception of menu items the number and location of restaurants type of brand quality and efficiency of service attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors we anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors if we are unable to continue to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our failure to drive both shortterm and longterm profitable sales growth through brand relevance operating excellence opening new restaurants of existing brands and developing or acquiring new dining brands could result in poor financial performance 

as part of our business strategy we intend to drive profitable sales growth by increasing samerestaurant sales at existing restaurants continuing to expand our current portfolio of restaurant brands and developing or acquiring additional brands that can be expanded profitably this strategy involves numerous risks and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives 

at existing brands we may not be able to maintain brand relevance and restaurant operating excellence to achieve sustainable samerestaurant sales growth and warrant new unit growth existing brand shortterm sales growth could be impacted if we are unable to drive near term guest count growth and longterm sales growth could be impacted if we fail to extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to our guests a failure to define and deliver clear relevant brands that generate sustainable samerestaurant traffic growth and produce nontraditional sales and earnings growth opportunities or to evolve inrestaurant and brand support cost structures so that competitively strong sales growth results in stable and improving profit margins could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition we may not be able to support sustained new unit growth or open all of our planned new restaurants and the new restaurants that we open may not be profitable or as profitable as our existing restaurants new restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize and even sales at successful newlyopened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation the opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on sales levels at existing restaurants 

the ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations the need to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses on a timely basis the need to comply with other regulatory requirements the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay construction increases in labor and building material costs the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms changes in weather or other acts of god that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions at each potential location we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites construction contractors management personnel hourly employees and other resources if we are unable to successfully manage these risks we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated sales and earnings in future periods 

we also may not be able to identify acquire and integrate additional brands or develop new business opportunities that are as profitable as our existing restaurants growth through acquisitions may involve additional risks for example we may pay too much for a brand relative to the actual economic return be required to borrow funds to make our acquisition which would increase our interest expense or be unable to successfully integrate an acquired brand into our operations 

failure to complete the acquisition of yard house or once completed failure to successfully integrate the yard house business and the additional indebtedness incurred to finance the yard house acquisition could adversely impact our stock price and future business and operations 

on july 12 2012 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which we expect to complete the acquisition of yard house completion of the acquisition is not assured and is subject to clearance under the hartscott act and certain closing conditions described in the merger agreement and related documents if the acquisition of yard house is not completed for any reason we may incur acquisitionrelated expenses without realizing the expected benefits and the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects an assumption that the acquisition will be completed 

our integration of yard houses business into our operations will be a complex and timeconsuming process that may not be successful the primary areas of focus for successfully combining the business of yard house with our operations may include among others retaining and integrating management and other key employees integrating information communications and other systems and managing the growth of the combined company 

  

even if we successfully integrate the business of yard house into our operations there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits we are seeking to acquire yard house with the expectation that the acquisition will result in various benefits for the combined company including among others business and growth opportunities and significant synergies from increased efficiency in purchasing distribution and other restaurant and corporate support increased competition andor deterioration in business conditions may limit our ability to expand this business as such we may not be able to realize the synergies goodwill business opportunities and growth prospects anticipated in connection with the acquisition 

if we consummate the acquisition of yard house we expect to have consolidated indebtedness that will be greater than our indebtedness prior to the acquisition the increased indebtedness and higher debttoequity ratio of our company may have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs our level of indebtedness could have important consequences for example it may require a portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal of and interest on our indebtedness thus reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures and general corporate requirements and limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures additional acquisitions or general corporate requirements particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations are revised downward 

our plans to expand our newer brands bahama breeze seasons 52 and eddie vs and the testing of synergy restaurants and other new business ventures that have not yet proven their longterm viability may not be successful which could require us to make substantial further investments in those brands and new business ventures and result in losses and impairments 

while each of our restaurant brands as well as each of our individual restaurants are subject to the risks and uncertainties described above there is an enhanced level of risk and uncertainty related to the operation and expansion of our newer brands such as bahama breeze seasons 52 and eddie vs and the testing of new restaurant formats such as synergy restaurants these brands and test formats have not yet proven their longterm viability or growth potential we have made substantial investments in the development and expansion of each of these brands and test formats and further investment is required while we have implemented a number of changes to operations at bahama breeze and believe we have improved the guest experience and unit economics sufficiently to restart modest unit growth there can be no assurance that these changes will continue to be successful or that additional new unit growth will occur seasons 52 and eddie vs also are in the early stages of their development and will require additional resources to support further growth our other new business initiatives such as the sale of consumer packaged goods and aquaculture lobster farming have not yet proved their longterm viability and may not be successful 

in each case these brands and formats will continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties that accompany any emerging restaurant brand or format 

a lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

the success of our restaurants depends in large part on their locations as demographic and economic patterns change current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations in addition desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation the occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may experience higherthananticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants we incur substantial preopening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close relocate or remodel existing restaurants the expenses of opening closing relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated an increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

a failure to identify and execute innovative marketing and guest relationship tactics ineffective or improper use of social media or other marketing initiatives and increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

if our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions if our advertising media or marketing expenses increase or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations a failure to sufficiently innovate develop guest relationship initiatives or maintain adequate and effective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales 

as part of our marketing efforts we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain guests and will begin efforts to consolidate our brands into a single digital technology platform these initiatives may not be successful and pose a variety of other risks as discussed above under the heading we rely heavily on information technology in our operations and insufficient guest or employee facing technology or any material failure inadequacy interruption or breach of security of any of our technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

a failure to develop and recruit effective leaders the loss of personnel with key capacities and skills or a significant shortage of highquality restaurant employees could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

our future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other employees our future growth also depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain highquality employees to work in and manage our restaurants we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees in order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth a failure to maintain appropriate organizational capacity and capability to support leadership excellence adequate resources innovative skill sets and expectations and build adequate bench strength required for growth a loss of key employees or a significant shortage of highquality restaurant employees could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

a failure to address cost pressures including rising costs for commodities health care and utilities used by our restaurants and a failure to effectively deliver cost management activities and achieve economies of scale in purchasing could compress our margins and adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food ingredients health care utilities unemployment and other related costs over which we may have little control operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities including shrimp lobster crab and other seafood as well as beef pork chicken cheese and produce the introduction of or changes to tariffs on imported shrimp or other food products could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products we attempt to leverage our size to achieve economies of scale in purchasing but there can be no assurances that we can always do so effectively we are subject to the general risks of inflation our restaurants’ operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as electricity and natural gas whether as a result of inflation or otherwise on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply in addition interruptions to the availability of gas electric water or other utilities whether due to aging infrastructure weather conditions fire animal damage trees digging accidents or other reasons largely out of our control may adversely affect our operations our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may lose sales or incur increased costs if our restaurants experience shortages or interruptions in the delivery of food and other products from our third party vendors and suppliers 

shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants may be caused by inclement weather natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods droughts and earthquakes the inability of our vendors to obtain credit in a tightened credit market or remain solvent given disruptions in the financial markets or other conditions beyond our control such shortages or interruptions could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants we may have a limited number of suppliers for certain of our products supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our restaurant operations if we raise prices as a result of increased food costs or shortages it may negatively impact our sales if we temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular items from a restaurant’s menu that restaurant may experience a significant reduction in sales during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our guests changing their dining habits 

adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could adversely affect our restaurant sales 

adverse weather conditions can impact guest traffic at our restaurants cause the temporary underutilization of outdoor patio seating and in more severe cases such as hurricanes tornadoes or other natural disasters cause temporary closures sometimes for prolonged periods which would negatively impact our restaurant sales changes in weather could result in construction delays interruptions to the availability of utilities and shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies which could increase our costs some climatologists predict that the longterm effects of climate change and global warming may result in more severe volatile weather or extended droughts which could increase the frequency of weather impacts on our operations 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to hedge exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we use or may use derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs including but not limited to coffee butter wheat soybean oil pork beef diesel fuel gasoline and natural gas changes in the values of these 

derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings included in our consolidated financial statements we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and other general macroeconomic factors including unemployment energy prices and interest rates that are largely out of our control may adversely affect consumer behavior and our results of operations 

our business results depend on a number of industryspecific and general economic factors many of which are beyond our control the full service dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in international national regional and local economic conditions seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant brands the performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends severe weather including hurricanes traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants 

general economic conditions may also adversely affect our results of operations recessionary economic cycles a protracted economic slowdown a worsening economy increased unemployment increased energy prices rising interest rates a downgrade of the us governments longterm credit rating the european debt crisis or other industrywide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings job losses foreclosures bankruptcies and falling home prices could cause guests to make fewer discretionary purchases and any significant decrease in our guest traffic or average profit per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance in addition if gasoline natural gas electricity and other energy costs increase and credit card home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine out may spend less on each dining out occasion or may choose more inexpensive restaurants 

furthermore we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts terrorist attacks efforts to combat terrorism heightened security requirements or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems could have on our operations the economy or consumer confidence generally any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures 

unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our guests could increase our costs reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact consumer spending patterns affect the availability and cost of credit and increase pension plan expenses 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control global credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil over the last few years characterized by the bankruptcy failure or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states and other governments these events may adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future there can be no assurances that we will be able to arrange credit on terms we believe are acceptable or that permit us to finance our business with historical margins the lack of credit along with the macroeconomic factors previously discussed may have an adverse impact on certain of our suppliers landlords and other tenants in retail centers in which we are located if these issues continue or worsen they could further materially impact these parties which in turn could negatively affect our financial results any new or continuing disruptions in the financial markets may also adversely affect the us and world economy which could negatively impact consumer spending patterns there can be no assurances as to how or when this period of turmoil will be resolved changes in the capital markets could also have significant effects on our pension plan our pension income or expense is affected by factors including the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for the pension plans for some of our employees the weighted average asset allocation and longterm rate of return of our pension plan assets the discount rate used to determine the service and interest cost components of our net periodic pension cost and assumed rates of increase in our employees’ future compensation if our pension plan assets do not achieve positive rates of return or if our estimates and assumed rates are not accurate our earnings may decrease because net periodic pension costs would rise and we could be required to provide additional funds to cover our obligations to employees under the pension plan 

we face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees business partners and vendors in foreign markets 

our expansion into international markets could create risks to our brands and reputation we believe that we have selected highcaliber international operating partners and franchisees with significant experience in restaurant operations and provide them 

with training and support however the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee if the franchisee does not successfully operate its restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards or guests have negative experiences due to issues with food quality or operational execution our brand values could suffer which could have an adverse effect on our business 

there also is no assurance that international operations will be profitable or that international growth will continue our international operations are subject to all of the same risks associated with our domestic operations as well as a number of additional risks these include among other things international economic and political conditions foreign currency fluctuations and differing cultures and consumer preferences 

we also are subject to governmental regulations throughout the world that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors these include antitrust and tax requirements antiboycott regulations importexportcustoms regulations and other international trade regulations the usa patriot act and the foreign corrupt practices act failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business 

we regard our darden restaurants ®  red lobster ®  olive garden ®  longhorn steakhouse ®  the capital grille ®  bahama breeze ®  seasons 52 ®  eddie vs prime seafood ®  and wildfish seafood grille ®  service marks and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts copyrights patents trademarks service marks and other common law rights such as trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our restaurants and services from infringement we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the united states and foreign jurisdictions however we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other persons although our policy is to oppose any such infringement further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant although we believe have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources 

impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired we test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit if the carrying value is less than the fair value no impairment exists if the carrying value is higher than the fair value there is an indication of impairment a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment exists factors may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and slower growth rates any adverse change in these factors would have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations we compute the amount of impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we are required to record a noncash impairment charge if the testing performed indicates that goodwill has been impaired 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets primarily the longhorn steakhouse ®  the capital grille ®  and eddie vs prime seafood ®  trademarks to determine if they are definite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

as with goodwill we test our indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable we estimate the fair value of the trademarks based on an income valuation model using the relief from royalty method which requires assumptions related to projected sales from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademarks and a discount rate 

we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

failure of our internal controls over financial reporting and future changes in accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results affect our reported results of operations or otherwise harm our business and financial results 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud our growth and acquisition of other restaurant companies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud a significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock 

a change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future changes to existing accounting rules or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our reported financial results additionally our assumptions estimates and judgments related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including but not limited to revenue recognition fair value of investments impairment of longlived assets leases and related economic transactions derivatives pension and postretirement benefits intangibles selfinsurance income taxes property and equipment unclaimed property laws and litigation and stockbased compensation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by us changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance

during fiscal 1999 we formed two subsidiary corporations each of which elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust “reit” under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code these elections limit the activities of both corporations to holding certain real estate assets the formation of these two reits is designed primarily to assist us in managing our real estate portfolio and possibly to provide a vehicle to access capital markets in the future 

both reits are nonpublic reits through our subsidiary companies we indirectly own 100 percent of all voting stock and greater than 995 percent of the total value of each reit for financial reporting purposes both reits are included in our consolidated financial statements

    strategy 

the restaurant industry is generally considered to be comprised of two segments quick service and full service the full service segment is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains we believe that capable operators of strong multiunit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the full service segment we plan to grow by increasing the number of restaurants in each of our existing brands and by developing or acquiring additional brands that can be expanded profitably 

while we are a leader in the full service dining segment we know we cannot be successful without a clear sense of who we are our core purpose is “to nourish and delight everyone we serve” this core purpose is supported by our core values 

 

         

our mission is to be “the best in full service dining now and for generations” we believe we can achieve this goal by continuing to build on our strategy to be a brandbuilding company which is focused on

synergy restaurant 

in march 2011 we opened a test “synergy restaurant” that houses both a red lobster and olive garden restaurant in the same building but with separate front doors dining rooms and brandspecific menus the shared building is designed to keep the guest experience the same while delivering cost efficiencies we developed this concept to test expansion into smaller markets that would not meet our population density requirements to build a single brand future synergy restaurants may not be limited to red lobster and olive garden combinations but could involve our other brands as well 

recent and planned growth 

during fiscal 2011 we opened 70 net new restaurants our actual and projected net new openings from continuing operations by brand are shown below 

  

 the actual number of openings for each of our brands will depend on many factors including our ability to locate appropriate sites negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms obtain necessary local governmental permits complete construction and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel our objective is to continue to expand all of our restaurant brands and to develop or acquire additional brands that can be expanded profitably we continue to test new ideas and brands and also to evaluate potential acquisition candidates to assess whether they would satisfy our strategic and financial objectives 

we consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant’s longterm success and we devote significant effort to the site selection process prior to entering a market we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors these factors include trade area demographics such as target population density and household income levels competitive influences in the trade area the site’s visibility accessibility and traffic volume and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls hotelmotel complexes offices and universities members of senior management evaluate inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after permits are obtained and the site is acquired 

the following table illustrates the approximate average capital investment size and dining capacity of the nine red lobster restaurants seven new restaurants and two relocations 34 olive garden restaurants 33 new restaurants and one relocation and the 25 longhorn steakhouse restaurants 24 new restaurants and one relocation opened during fiscal 2011 the table excludes any rebuilt restaurants 

 

  

    we systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards when a restaurant falls below minimum standards we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes and implement marketing and operational plans to improve that restaurant’s performance if performance does not improve to acceptable levels the restaurant is evaluated for relocation closing or conversion to one of our other brands 

during fiscal 2009 we permanently closed three red lobster restaurants one olive garden restaurant and five longhorn steakhouse restaurants during fiscal 2010 we permanently closed three red lobster restaurants and three longhorn steakhouse restaurants during fiscal 2011 we permanently closed one red lobster restaurant two olive garden restaurants and two longhorn steakhouse restaurants permanent closures are typically due to 

  

economic changes in trade areas the expiration of lease agreements or site selection concerns accordingly we continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges 

restaurant operations 

we believe that highquality restaurant management is critical to our longterm success our restaurant management structure varies by brand and restaurant size we issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards 

each typical red lobster and olive garden restaurant is led by a general manager and each longhorn steakhouse restaurant is led by a managing partner each also has three to five additional managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant in addition each restaurant employs approximately 50185 hourly employees most of whom work parttime restaurant general managers or managing partners report to a director of operations who is responsible for approximately six to 10 restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by all levels of supervision to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards 

each bahama breeze restaurant is led by a general manager and each the capital grille and seasons 52 restaurant is led by a managing partner each also has one to four assistant managers and one to three kitchen managers in addition each restaurant employs an average of approximately 70 to 115 hourly employees the general manager or managing partner of each restaurant reports directly to a director of operations who has operational responsibility for approximately three to ten restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by all levels of supervision to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards 

our learning center of excellence in partnership with each brand’s head of training together with senior operations executives are responsible for developing and maintaining our operations training programs these efforts include a 12 to 15week training program for management trainees and continuing development programs for managers supervisors and directors the emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant brand but includes leadership restaurant business management and culinary skills we also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants including deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations the opening training teams typically begin work one week prior to opening and remain at the new restaurant for up to three weeks after the opening they are redeployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant’s operating staff 

we maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our managementlevel employees we believe that our leadership position strong successoriented culture and various shortterm and longterm incentive programs including stock and stockbased compensation help attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers 

quality assurance 

our total quality department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe highquality food in a clean and safe environment through rigorous physical evaluation and testing at our north american laboratories and through “point source inspection” by our international team of quality specialists in several foreign countries we purchase only seafood that meets or exceeds our specifications we use independent third parties to inspect and evaluate commodity vendors in addition any commodity supplier that produces a “highrisk” product is subject to a food safety evaluation by darden personnel at least annually we require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive hazard analysis and critical control point “haccp” food safety programs adopted by the us food and drug administration the haccp programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause foodborne illnesses by applying scientificallybased controls to analyze hazards identify and monitor critical control points and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met since 1976 we have required routine microbiological testing of seafood and other commodities for quality and microbiological safety in addition our total quality managers and third party auditors visit each restaurant periodically throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food 

  

safety and sanitation the total quality managers also serve as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety 

purchasing and distribution 

our ability to ensure a consistent supply of highquality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant brands depends on reliable sources of procurement our purchasing staff sources negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 2000 suppliers whose products originate in more than 30 countries suppliers must meet strict quality control standards in the development harvest catch and production of food products competitive bids longterm contracts and longterm vendor relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products 

we believe that our seafood purchasing capabilities are a significant competitive advantage our purchasing staff travels routinely within the united states and internationally to source more than 100 varieties of topquality seafood at competitive prices we believe that we have established excellent longterm relationships with key seafood vendors and usually source our product directly from producers not brokers or middlemen while the supply of certain seafood species is volatile we believe we have the ability to identify alternative seafood products and to adjust our menus as necessary all other essential food products are available or can be made available upon short notice from alternative qualified suppliers because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales controlled inventories of specified products are distributed to restaurants through thirdparty national distribution companies in addition through agreements between our subsidiary darden direct distribution inc and these distribution companies we maintain inventory ownership and dedicated operations in select environments enhancing our supply chain’s competitive advantage 

our supplier diversity program is an integral part of our purchasing efforts through this program we identify minority and womenowned vendors and assist them in establishing supplier relationships with us we are committed to the development and growth of minority and womenowned enterprises and during fiscal 2011 we spent approximately 58 percent and 35 percent respectively of our purchasing dollars with those firms 

we continue to invest in new technologies to improve our purchasing and restaurant operations during fiscal 2011 we completed the implementation of “ikitchen” a webbased software system to our regional suppliers the system is designed to more efficiently handle restaurant product orders receiving invoice approval and inventories 

advertising and marketing 

we believe we have developed significant marketing and advertising capabilities our size enables us to be a leading advertiser in the full service dining segment of the restaurant industry red lobster and olive garden leverage the efficiency of national network television advertising olive garden supplements this with cable local television and digital advertising and red lobster with cable and digital advertising longhorn steakhouse currently uses local television advertising and began national cable television advertising in fiscal 2011 the capital grille bahama breeze and seasons 52 do not use national television advertising our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to attract customers we implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase our sales and profits as well as strengthen our brands we also rely on outdoor billboard direct mail and email advertising as well as radio newspapers digital coupons search engine marketing and social media such as facebook ® and twitter ®  as appropriate to attract and retain customers we have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor customer satisfaction and evolving expectations

in january 2011 we were ranked among fortune magazine’s “100 best companies to work for” in america we were the first fullservice restaurant company ever to be named to the list and are committed to fostering a strong valuesbased culture where employees can learn thrive and grow 

information technology 

we strive for leadership in the restaurant business by using technology as a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy since 1975 computers located in the restaurants have been used to assist in the management of the restaurants we have implemented technologyenabled business solutions targeted at improved financial control cost management enhanced guest service and improved employee effectiveness these solutions are designed to be used across restaurant brands yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant brand our strategy is to fully integrate systems to drive operational efficiencies and enable restaurant teams to focus on restaurant operations excellence over the past few years we implemented a new meal pacing system in all olive garden and red lobster locations designed to properly pace the preparation of menu items based on cooktime to enhance the guest’s experience and enhance restaurant capacity by increasing table turns during fiscal 2012 bahama breeze longhorn steakhouse the capital grille and seasons 52 will pilot and begin implementing this meal pacing system in their locations

competition 

the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food price service restaurant location personnel brand attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing the 

  

restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing restaurants and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power we compete within each market with national and regional chains and locallyowned restaurants for customers management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites we also face growing competition from the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section we expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas 

other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled “purchasing and distribution” “advertising and marketing” and “information technology” in this item 1 and in our risk factors in item 1a of this form 10k

seasonality 

our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 our average sales per restaurant were highest in the winter and spring followed by the summer and lowest in the fall during fiscal 2009 our average sales per restaurant were highest in the summer and spring followed by the winter and lowest in the fall holidays changes in the economy severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions because of the seasonality of our business results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

government regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws affecting our business each of our restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities which include health safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located the development and operation of restaurants depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites which are subject to zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations to date we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals 

during fiscal 2011 92 percent of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site in most cases on an annual basis and licenses may 

  

be revoked or suspended for cause at any time these regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant operation including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours of operation advertising wholesale purchasing inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages the failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these licenses would adversely affect the restaurant’s operations we also are subject in certain states to “dramshop” statutes which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person who then causes injury to himself or a third party we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance 

we also are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws governing such matters as overtime tip credits working conditions safety standards and hiring and employment practices changes in these laws during fiscal 2011 have not had a material effect on our operations

 item 1a risk factors tableend various risks and uncertainties could affect our business any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations therefore the following is not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

food safety and foodborne illness concerns throughout the supply chain may have an adverse effect on our business 

food safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our customers enjoy safe quality food products however food safety issues could be caused by food suppliers or distributors and as a result be out of our control in addition regardless of the source or cause any report of foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination at one of our restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our brands and have a negative impact on our sales even instances of foodborne illness food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at 

  

restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients resulting in higher costs and lower margins 

litigation including allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees guests suppliers shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation these actions and proceedings may involve allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices including wage and hour violations and employment discrimination guest discrimination food safety issues including poor food quality foodborne illness food tampering food contamination and adverse health effects from consumption of various food products or highcalorie foods including obesity other personal injury violation of “dram shop” laws providing an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or a third party trademark infringement violation of the federal securities laws or other concerns the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time the cost to defend litigation may be significant there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of our brands regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are found liable litigation could impact our operations in other ways as well allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices for example could adversely affect employee acquisition and retention as a result litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable publicity or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could harm our reputation and adversely impact our guest counts and sales 

the good reputation of our restaurant brands is a key factor in the success of our business actual or alleged incidents at any of our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could harm our brands even incidents occurring at restaurants operated by our competitors or in the supply chain generally could result in negative publicity that could harm the restaurant industry overall and indirectly our own brands negative publicity may result from allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices guest discrimination illness injury or any of the other matters discussed above that could give rise to litigation regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants or only to a single restaurant could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand negative publicity also may result from health concerns including food safety and flu outbreaks publication of government or industry findings concerning food products environmental disasters crime incidents data privacy breaches scandals involving our employees or operational problems at our restaurants all of which could make our brands and menu offerings less appealing to our guests and negatively impact our guest counts and sales adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of our brands or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to a number of risks relating to federal state and local regulation of our business including in the areas of health care reform environmental matters minimum wage data privacy menu labeling immigration requirements and taxes and an insufficient or ineffective response to government regulation may impact our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability 

the restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations the development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites which are subject to building zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations and requirements we are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health sanitation safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food including regulations regarding product safety nutritional content and menu labeling we are subject to federal and state laws governing minimum wages unionization and other labor issues these include the fair labor standards act of 1938 and requirements concerning overtime family leave tip credits working conditions and safety standards they also include the immigration reform and control act of 1986 which requires among other things the preparation of form i9 to verify that employees are authorized to accept employment in the united states 

  

we also are subject to federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities such as the americans with disabilities act of 1990 compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation new or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our cost of labor 

we are reviewing the health care reform law as part of that review we will evaluate the potential impacts of this new law on our business and accommodate various parts of the law as they take effect there are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can accommodate all of the costs associated with compliance we did not receive taxfree subsidies for providing prescription drugs to retirees under medicare part d therefore we have no deferred tax assets associated with our retiree medical plan that would be impacted by this law the health care reform law also requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus we do not expect to incur any material costs from compliance with this provision but cannot anticipate any changes in guest behavior resulting from the implementation of this portion of the law which could have an adverse effect on our sales or results of operations 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge emission and disposal of hazardous materials there also has been increasing focus by us and overseas governmental authorities on other environmental matters such as climate change the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption this increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters such as the emission of greenhouse gases where “cap and trade” initiatives could effectively impose a tax on carbon emissions legislative regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials taxes transportation and utilities which could decrease our operating profits and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment 

we are subject to laws relating to information security privacy cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud an increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information including social security numbers financial information including credit card numbers and health information compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and any failure or perceived failure to comply with those laws could harm our reputation or lead to litigation which could adversely affect our financial condition 

the impact of current laws and regulations the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues could increase our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal state and local authorities could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings 

we may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs 

our restaurant operations are subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages working conditions overtime and tip credits as federal and state minimum wage rates increase we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage labor shortages increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs this in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales conversely if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices our profitability may decline in addition the current premiums that we pay for our insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property health and directors’ and officers’ liability may increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs the dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers’ compensation and general liability insurance for which we carry high perclaim deductibles may also increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs further the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses 

  

we rely heavily on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or breach of security of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

we rely heavily on information systems across our operations including for management of our supply chain pointofsale processing system in our restaurants and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems a material network breach in the security of these systems as a result of a cyber attack or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to us or an individual this could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets or the improper use of personal information or other “identity theft” each of these situations or data privacy breaches may cause delays in customer service reduce efficiency in our operations require significant capital investments to remediate the problem or result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation 

our inability or failure to execute on a comprehensive business continuity plan following a major natural disaster such as a hurricane or manmade disaster including terrorism at our corporate facility could materially adversely impact our business 

many of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one florida location   we have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature including hurricanes and other natural disasters and back up and offsite locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information however if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans we may experience delays in recovery of data inability to perform vital corporate functions tardiness in required reporting and compliance failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims 

health concerns arising from foodrelated pandemics outbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

the united states and other countries have experienced or may experience in the future outbreaks of viruses such as norovirus avian flu or “sars” and h1n1 or “swine flu” or other diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy commonly known as “mad cow disease” to the extent that a virus or disease is foodborne or perceived to be foodborne future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product or could reduce public confidence in food handling andor public assembly for example health concerns relating to the consumption of beef or to specific events such as an outbreak of “mad cow disease” may adversely impact sales at longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille restaurants that offer beef as a primary menu item in addition public concern over avian flu may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry the inability to serve beef or poultrybased products would restrict our ability to provide a variety of menu items to our guests if we change a restaurant menu in response to such concerns we may lose customers who do not prefer the new menu and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new customer base to produce the sales needed to make the restaurant profitable we also may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of such a change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors if a virus is transmitted by human contact our employees or guests could become infected or could choose or be advised to avoid gathering in public places any of which could adversely affect our restaurant guest traffic and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level we also could be adversely affected if jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to continue to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

the full service dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing service location personnel and type and quality of food and there are many wellestablished competitors we 

  

compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locallyowned restaurants we also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services particularly in the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section we compete primarily on the quality variety and value perception of menu items the number and location of restaurants type of brand quality and efficiency of service attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors we anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors if we are unable to continue to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our failure to drive sufficient profitable sales growth through brand relevance operating excellence opening new restaurants and developing or acquiring new dining brands could result in poor financial performance 

as part of our business strategy we intend to drive profitable sales growth by increasing samerestaurant sales at existing restaurants continuing to expand our current portfolio of restaurant brands and developing or acquiring additional brands that can be expanded profitably this strategy involves numerous risks and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives we may not be able to maintain brand relevance and restaurant operating excellence at existing brands to achieve sustainable samerestaurant sales growth and warrant new unit growth a failure to define and deliver clear relevant brands that generate sustainable samerestaurant traffic growth and produce nontraditional sales and earnings growth opportunities or to evolve inrestaurant and brand support cost structures so that competitively strong sales growth results in stable and improving profit margins could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition we may not be able to support sustained new unit growth or open all of our planned new restaurants and the new restaurants that we open may not be profitable or as profitable as our existing restaurants new restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize and even sales at successful newlyopened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation the opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on sales levels at existing restaurants furthermore we may not be able to develop or acquire additional brands that are as profitable as our existing restaurants growth through acquisitions may involve additional risks for example we may pay too much for a brand relative to the actual economic return be required to borrow funds to make our acquisition which would increase our interest expense or be unable to successfully integrate an acquired brand into our operations 

the ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations the need to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses on a timely basis the need to comply with other regulatory requirements the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay construction increases in labor and building material costs the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms changes in weather or other acts of god that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions at each potential location we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites construction contractors management personnel hourly employees and other resources if we are unable to successfully manage these risks we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated sales and earnings in future periods 

we incurred substantial additional indebtedness to finance the rare acquisition which may decrease our business flexibility and increase our borrowing costs 

we incurred substantial additional indebtedness to finance the rare acquisition although our adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio has fallen to near preacquisition levels it remains higher than it was before the acquisition our increased indebtedness and higher adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio as compared to that which existed on a historical basis may have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs 

our level of indebtedness could have important consequences for example it may 

  

   there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity a default under our debt instruments may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

our plans to expand our newer brands bahama breeze and seasons 52 and the testing of synergy restaurants that have not yet proven their longterm viability may not be successful which could require us to make substantial further investments in those brands and test formats and result in losses and impairments 

while each of our restaurant brands as well as each of our individual restaurants are subject to the risks and uncertainties described above there is an enhanced level of risk and uncertainty related to the operation and expansion of our newer brands such as bahama breeze and seasons 52 and the testing of new restaurant formats such as synergy restaurants these brands and test formats have not yet proven their longterm viability or growth potential we have made substantial investments in the development and expansion of each of these brands and test formats and further investment is required while we have implemented a number of changes to operations at bahama breeze and believe we have improved the guest experience and unit economics sufficiently to restart modest unit growth there can be no assurance that these changes will continue to be successful or that additional new unit growth will occur seasons 52 also is in the early stages of its development and will require additional resources to support further growth there likewise can be no assurances that the testing of the synergy restaurant format will prove successful in each case these brands and formats will continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties that accompany any emerging restaurant brand or format 

a lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

the success of our restaurants depends in large part on their locations as demographic and economic patterns change current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations in addition desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation the occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may experience higherthananticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants we incur substantial preopening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close relocate or remodel existing restaurants the expenses of opening closing relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated an increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

if our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions if our advertising media or marketing expenses increase or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations inadequate or ineffective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales 

a failure to develop and recruit effective leaders the loss of key personnel or a significant shortage of highquality restaurant employees could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

our future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other employees our future growth also depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain highquality employees to work in and manage our restaurants we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees in order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth a failure to maintain appropriate organizational capacity and capability to support leadership excellence and build adequate bench strength required for growth a loss of key employees or a significant shortage of highquality restaurant employees could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

the price and availability of key food products ingredients and utilities used by our restaurants and a failure to achieve economies of scale in purchasing could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food ingredients utilities and other related costs over which we may have little control operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities including shrimp lobster crab and other seafood as well as beef pork chicken cheese and produce the introduction of or changes to tariffs on imported shrimp or other food products could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products we attempt to leverage our size to achieve economies of scale in purchasing but there can be no assurances that we can always do so effectively we are subject to the general risks of inflation our restaurants’ operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as electricity and natural gas whether as a result of inflation or otherwise on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply in addition interruptions to the availability of gas electric water or other utilities whether due to aging infrastructure weather conditions fire animal damage trees digging accidents or other reasons largely out of our control may adversely affect our operations some climatologists predict that the longterm effects of climate change may result in more severe volatile weather our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may lose sales or incur increased costs if our restaurants experience shortages or interruptions in the delivery of food and other products from our third party vendors and suppliers 

possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants caused by inclement weather natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes the inability of our vendors to obtain credit in a tightened credit market or remain solvent given disruptions in the financial markets or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants we may have a limited number of suppliers for certain of our products supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our restaurant operations if we temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular items from a restaurant’s menu that restaurant may experience a significant reduction in sales during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our customers changing their dining habits 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to hedge exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we use or may use derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs including but not limited to coffee butter wheat soybean oil pork beef diesel fuel gasoline and natural gas changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings included in our consolidated financial statements we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

  

certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and other general macroeconomic factors including unemployment energy prices and interest rates that are largely out of our control may adversely affect consumer behavior and our results of operations 

our business results depend on a number of industryspecific and general economic factors many of which are beyond our control the full service dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in national regional and local economic conditions seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant brands the performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends severe weather including hurricanes traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants 

general economic conditions may also adversely affect our results of operations recessionary economic cycles a protracted economic slowdown a worsening economy increased unemployment increased energy prices rising interest rates or other industrywide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings job losses foreclosures bankruptcies and falling home prices could cause customers to make fewer discretionary purchases and any significant decrease in our customer traffic or average profit per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance in addition if gasoline natural gas electricity and other energy costs increase and credit card home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine out may spend less on each dining out occasion or may choose more inexpensive restaurants 

furthermore we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts terrorist attacks efforts to combat terrorism heightened security requirements or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems could have on our operations the economy or consumer confidence generally any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures 

unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our customers could increase our costs reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact consumer spending patterns affect the availability and cost of credit and increase pension plan expenses 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control global credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil recently characterized by the bankruptcy failure or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states and other governments these events may adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future there can be no assurances that we will be able to arrange credit on terms we believe are acceptable or that permit us to finance our business with historical margins the lack of credit along with the macroeconomic factors previously discussed may have an adverse impact on certain of our suppliers landlords and other tenants in retail centers in which we are located if these issues continue or worsen they could further materially impact these parties which in turn could negatively affect our financial results any new or continuing disruptions in the financial markets may also adversely affect the us and world economy which could negatively impact consumer spending patterns there can be no assurances as to how or when this period of turmoil will be resolved changes in the capital markets could also have significant effects on our pension plan our pension income or expense is affected by factors including the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for the pension plans for some of our employees the weighted average asset allocation and longterm rate of return of our pension plan assets the discount rate used to determine the service and interest cost components of our net periodic pension cost and assumed rates of increase in our employees’ future compensation if our pension plan assets do not achieve positive rates of return or if our estimates 

  

and assumed rates are not accurate our earnings may decrease because net periodic pension costs would rise and we could be required to provide additional funds to cover our obligations to employees under the pension plan 

we face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees business partners and vendors in foreign markets 

our expansion into international markets could create risks to our brands and reputation we believe that we have selected highcaliber international operating partners and franchisees with significant experience in restaurant operations and provide them with training and support however the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee if the franchisee does not successfully operate its restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards or customers have negative experiences due to issues with food quality or operational execution our brand values could suffer which could have an adverse effect on our business 

there also is no assurance that international operations will be profitable or that international growth will continue our international operations are subject to all of the same risks associated with our domestic operations as well as a number of additional risks these include among other things international economic and political conditions foreign currency fluctuations and differing cultures and consumer preferences 

we also are subject to governmental regulations throughout the world that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors these include antitrust and tax requirements antiboycott regulations importexportcustoms regulations and other international trade regulations the usa patriot act and the foreign corrupt practices act failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business 

we regard our darden restaurants ®  red lobster ®  olive garden ®  longhorn steakhouse ®  the capital grille ®  bahama breeze ®  and seasons 52 ® service marks and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts copyrights patents trademarks service marks and other common law rights such as trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our restaurants and services from infringement we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the united states and foreign jurisdictions however we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other persons although our policy is to oppose any such infringement further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant although we believe have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources 

impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired we test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit if the carrying value is less than the fair value no impairment exists if the carrying value is higher than the fair value there is an indication of impairment a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment exists factors may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and slower growth rates any adverse change in these factors would have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations we compute the amount of impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we are required to record a noncash impairment charge if the testing performed indicates that goodwill has been impaired 

  

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets primarily the longhorn steakhouse ® and the capital grille ® trademarks to determine if they are definite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

as with goodwill we test our indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable we estimate the fair value of the trademarks based on an income valuation model using the relief from royalty method which requires assumptions related to projected sales from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademarks and a discount rate 

we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

failure of our internal controls over financial reporting and future changes in accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results affect our reported results of operations or otherwise harm our business and financial results 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud our growth and acquisition of other restaurant companies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud a significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock 

a change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future changes to existing accounting rules or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our reported financial results additionally our assumptions estimates and judgments related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including but not limited to revenue recognition fair value of investments impairment of longlived assets leases and related economic transactions derivatives pension and postretirement benefits intangibles selfinsurance income taxes property and equipment unclaimed property laws and litigation and stockbased compensation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by us changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance

    strategy 

the restaurant industry is generally considered to be comprised of two segments quick service and full service the full service segment is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains we believe that capable operators of strong multiunit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the full service segment we plan to grow by increasing the number of restaurants in each of our existing brands and by developing or acquiring additional brands that can be expanded profitably 

while we are a leader in the full service dining segment we know we cannot be successful without a clear sense of who we are our core purpose is “to nourish and delight everyone we serve” this core purpose is supported by our core values 

 

         

our mission is to be “the best in full service dining now and for generations” we believe we can achieve this goal by continuing to build on our strategy to be a brandbuilding company which is focused on

bahama breeze restaurants bring guests the feeling of a caribbean escape offering the food drinks and atmosphere found in the islands the menu features distinctive caribbeaninspired fresh seafood chicken and steaks as well as signature specialty drinks the first bahama breeze opened in 1996 and met with strong positive consumer response we continued to test the brand by opening a limited number of additional restaurants in each of the following years and began national expansion of the brand in 1998 the brand was well received by guests but due to weakerthanexpected financial performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 bahama breeze closed six restaurants and wrote down the carrying value of four others this action reduced the total number of restaurants in operation to 32 and all new restaurant expansion was postponed 

since fiscal 2004 bahama breeze has implemented changes to become a more relevant brand for its guests evolve its menu to make it more approachable yet still distinctive and improve the guest experience while lowering its operating costs in fiscal 2007 bahama breeze wrote down the carrying value of five restaurants and closed nine but improved the guest experience and unit economics sufficiently at the remaining restaurants that we have restarted modest unit growth with one restaurant opening in each of the last two fiscal years

discontinued operations 

in fiscal 2007 we announced the closure of 54 smokey bones barbeque  grill restaurants and two rocky river grillhouse restaurants and subsequently sold the remaining 73 operating smokey bones restaurants during fiscal 2008 also in fiscal 2007 we closed nine bahama breeze restaurants the results of operations impairment carrying costs and subsequent gain or loss on disposal for these restaurants are treated as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

  

recent and planned growth 

on a continuing operations basis during fiscal 2010 we opened 53 net new restaurants our actual and projected net new openings from continuing operations by brand are shown below 

 

 the actual number of openings for each of our brands will depend on many factors including our ability to locate appropriate sites negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms obtain necessary local governmental permits complete construction and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel our objective is to continue to expand all of our restaurant brands and to develop or acquire additional brands that can be expanded profitably we have continued to test new ideas and brands and also to evaluate potential acquisition candidates to assess whether they would satisfy our strategic and financial objectives 

we consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant’s longterm success and we devote significant effort to the site selection process prior to entering a market we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors these factors include trade area demographics such as target population density and household income levels competitive influences in the trade area the site’s visibility accessibility and traffic volume and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls hotelmotel complexes offices and universities members of senior management evaluate inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after permits are obtained and the site is acquired 

the following table illustrates the approximate average capital investment size and dining capacity of the nine red lobster restaurants seven new restaurants and two relocations 33 olive garden restaurants 32 new restaurants and one relocation and the 14 longhorn steakhouse restaurants 14 new and no relocations opened during fiscal 2010 the table excludes any rebuilt restaurants 

 

  

    we systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards when a restaurant falls below minimum standards we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes and implement marketing and operational plans to improve that restaurant’s performance if performance does not improve to acceptable levels the restaurant is evaluated for relocation closing or conversion to one of our other brands 

as discussed above under “discontinued operations” we sold or closed a number of restaurants during fiscal 2007 and 2008 while not included in discontinued operations in fiscal 2008 we permanently closed three 

  

red lobster restaurants one olive garden restaurant and following the acquisition of rare on october 1 2007 one longhorn steakhouse restaurant during fiscal 2009 we permanently closed three red lobster restaurants one olive garden restaurant and five longhorn steakhouse restaurants during fiscal 2010 we permanently closed three red lobster restaurants and three longhorn steakhouse restaurants permanent closures are typically due to economic changes in trade areas the expiration of lease agreements or site selection concerns accordingly we continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges 

restaurant operations 

we believe that highquality restaurant management is critical to our longterm success our restaurant management structure varies by brand and restaurant size we issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards 

each typical red lobster olive garden and bahama breeze restaurant is led by a general manager and three to five additional managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant each restaurant also employs approximately 50185 hourly employees most of who work parttime restaurant general managers report to multiunit supervisors who are directors of operations or regional directors at the end of fiscal 2010 each multiunit supervisor was responsible for approximately six to 10 restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by all levels of supervision to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards 

the management staff of a typical longhorn steakhouse the capital grille and seasons 52 restaurant consists of one managing partner one to four assistant managers and one or two kitchen managers in addition each of these restaurants employs approximately 40 to 80 hourly employees the managing partner of each restaurant reports directly to a multiunit supervisor who may be a director of operations or regional director multiunit supervisors have operational responsibility for approximately four to nine restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by all levels of supervision to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards 

each brand’s head of training together with senior operations executives are responsible for developing and maintaining that brand’s operations training programs these efforts include a 12 to 15week training program for management trainees and continuing development programs for managers supervisors and directors the emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant brand but includes leadership restaurant business management and culinary skills we also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants including deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations the opening training teams typically begin work one week prior to opening and remain at the new restaurant for up to three weeks after the opening they are redeployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant’s operating staff 

we maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our managementlevel employees we believe that our leadership position strong successoriented culture and various shortterm and longterm incentive programs including stock and stockbased compensation help attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers with the acquisition of rare we also have continued a managing partner program in which qualifying general managers of longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille restaurants receive cash compensation and restricted stock awards based upon individual performance 

quality assurance 

our total quality department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe highquality food in a clean and safe environment through rigorous physical evaluation and testing at our north american laboratories and through “point source inspection” by our international team of quality specialists in several foreign countries we purchase only seafood that meets or exceeds our specifications we use independent third parties to inspect and evaluate commodity vendors in addition any commodity supplier that produces a “highrisk” product is subject to a food safety evaluation by darden personnel at least annually we require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive hazard analysis and critical control point “haccp” food safety programs adopted by the us food and drug administration the haccp programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause foodborne illnesses by applying scientificallybased controls to analyze hazards identify and 

  

monitor critical control points and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met since 1976 we have required routine microbiological testing of seafood and other commodities for quality and microbiological safety in addition our total quality managers and third party auditors visit each restaurant periodically throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation the total quality managers also serve as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety 

purchasing and distribution 

our ability to ensure a consistent supply of highquality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant brands depends on reliable sources of procurement our purchasing staff sources negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 2000 suppliers in more than 30 countries suppliers must meet strict quality control standards in the development harvest catch and production of food products competitive bids longterm contracts and longterm vendor relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products 

we believe that our seafood purchasing capabilities are a significant competitive advantage our purchasing staff travels routinely within the united states and internationally to source more than 100 varieties of topquality seafood at competitive prices we believe that we have established excellent longterm relationships with key seafood vendors and usually source our product directly from producers not brokers or middlemen while the supply of certain seafood species is volatile we believe we have the ability to identify alternative seafood products and to adjust our menus as necessary all other essential food products are available or can be made available upon short notice from alternative qualified suppliers because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales controlled inventories of specified products are distributed to restaurants through independent national distribution companies in addition through strategic alliances between our subsidiary darden direct distribution inc and these distribution companies we maintain inventory ownership and dedicated operations in select environments enhancing our supply chain’s competitive advantage 

our supplier diversity program is an integral part of our purchasing efforts through this program we identify minority and womenowned vendors and assist them in establishing supplier relationships with us we are committed to the development and growth of minority and womenowned enterprises and through the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2010 we spent approximately 83 percent and 41 percent respectively of our purchasing dollars with those firms 

we continue to invest in new technologies to improve our purchasing and restaurant operations we are in the process of expanding “ikitchen” a webbased software system to our regional suppliers the system is designed to more efficiently handle restaurant product orders receiving invoice approval and inventories 

advertising and marketing 

we believe we have developed significant marketing and advertising capabilities our size enables us to be a leading advertiser in the full service dining segment of the restaurant industry red lobster and olive garden leverage the efficiency of national network television advertising olive garden supplements this with cable local television and digital advertising and red lobster with cable and digital advertising longhorn steakhouse currently uses local television advertising with plans to begin national cable television advertising in fiscal 2011 the capital grille bahama breeze and seasons 52 do not use national television advertising our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to attract customers we implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase our sales and profits as well as strengthen our brands we also rely on outdoor billboard and direct mail advertising as well as radio newspaper and direct mail coupon programs as appropriate to attract customers we have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor customer satisfaction and evolving expectations 

  

employees 

at the end of fiscal 2010 we employed approximately 174000 persons of these employees approximately 164000 were hourly restaurant personnel the remainder were restaurant management personnel located in the restaurants or in the field or were located at our restaurant support center facility in orlando florida our operating executives have an average of more than 14 years of experience with us the restaurant general managers average 12 years with us we believe that we provide working conditions and compensation that compare favorably with those of our competitors most employees other than restaurant management and corporate management are paid on an hourly basis none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our employee relations to be good 

information technology 

we strive for leadership in the restaurant business by using technology as a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy since 1975 computers located in the restaurants have been used to assist in the management of the restaurants we have implemented systems targeted at improved financial control cost management enhanced guest service and improved employee effectiveness management information systems are designed to be used across restaurant brands yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant brand these management information systems include a suite of webenabled and fully integrated financial and human resource including payroll and benefits systems and a highspeed data network connecting all restaurants to all current and anticipated future applications over the past several years we implemented “dash” a next generation technology platform for our restaurant pointofsale processing system in all of our restaurants and a new meal pacing system in olive garden and red lobster restaurants the new meal pacing system is designed to properly pace the preparation of menu items based on cooktimes to enhance the guest’s experience and enhance restaurant capacity by increasing table turns olive garden also tested a new table management system during fiscal 2010 that is expected to be tested further in fiscal 2011 and may be rolled out to all olive garden locations 

in addition during the past few years we implemented a webbased labor management system which has been in use for some time at red lobster and bahama breeze in all olive garden restaurants and began the rollout to longhorn steakhouse our data center and network operations for this new technology are housed in our data center located at our restaurant support center campus 

restaurant hardware and software support for all of our restaurant brands is provided or coordinated from the restaurant support center facility in orlando florida seven days a week 24 hours a day a communications network sends and receives critical business data to and from the restaurants throughout the day and night providing timely and extensive information on business activity in every location our data center contains sufficient computing power to process information from all restaurants quickly and efficiently our information is processed in a secure environment to protect both the actual data and the physical assets we guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan which includes storing critical business information offsite testing the disaster recovery plan at a hostsite facility and providing onsite power backup via a large diesel generator we use internally developed proprietary software as well as purchased software with proven nonproprietary hardware this allows processing power to be distributed effectively to each of our restaurants 

as noted above under “purchasing and distribution” we continue to expand “ikitchen” to our regional suppliers and have begun efforts to strengthen existing tools used to forecast demand for product level information throughout the supply chain 

our management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates will position us well to support current needs and future growth we are committed to maintaining an industry leadership position in information systems and computing technology we use a strategic information systems planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic financial regulatory and other business advantage criteria 

competition 

the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food price service restaurant location personnel brand attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing the 

  

restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing restaurants and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power we compete within each market with national and regional chains and locallyowned restaurants for customers management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites we also face growing competition from the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section we expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas 

other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled “purchasing and distribution” “advertising and marketing” and “information technology” in this item 1 and in our risk factors in item 1a of this form 10k 

trademarks service marks franchises and joint ventures 

we regard our darden restaurants ®  red lobster ®  olive garden ®  longhorn steakhouse ®  the capital grille ®  bahama breeze ®  and seasons 52 ® service marks and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and as being important to our marketing efforts our policy is to pursue registration of our important service marks and trademarks and to oppose vigorously any infringement of them generally with appropriate renewal and use the registration of our service marks and trademarks will continue indefinitely 

all but three of our 1824 restaurants in operation at may 30 2010 are companyowned and operated those three restaurants are located in central florida and are owned by joint ventures managed by us the joint ventures pay management fees to us and we control the joint ventures’ use of our service marks we have one unaffiliated franchisee with the right under an area development and franchise agreement to operate franchised longhorn steakhouse restaurants in puerto rico as of may 30 2010 this franchisee operated five longhorn steakhouse restaurants in puerto rico our only restaurant operations outside of north america are conducted through an area development and franchise agreement with an unaffiliated japanese corporation this corporation operated 25 red lobster restaurants in japan as of may 30 2010 we do not have an ownership interest in this corporation but we receive royalty income under the franchise agreement the amount of income we derive from these joint venture and franchise arrangements is not material to our consolidated financial statements 

seasonality 

our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2008 our average sales per restaurant were highest in the winter and spring followed by the summer and lowest in the fall during fiscal 2009 our average sales per restaurant were highest in the summer and spring followed by the winter and lowest in the fall holidays severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions because of the seasonality of our business results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

government regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws affecting our business each of our restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities which include health safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located the development and operation of restaurants depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites which are subject to zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations to date we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals 

during fiscal 2010 91 percent of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site in most cases on an annual basis and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time these regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant operation including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours of operation advertising wholesale purchasing inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages the failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these licenses would adversely affect the restaurant’s operations we also are subject in certain states to “dramshop” statutes which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that 

  

serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person who then causes injury to himself or a third party we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance 

we also are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws governing such matters as overtime tip credits working conditions safety standards and hiring and employment practices changes in these laws during fiscal 2010 have not had a material effect on our operations 

we currently are operating under a tip rate alternative commitment “trac” agreement with the internal revenue service through increased educational and other efforts in the restaurants the trac agreement reduces the likelihood of potential chainwide employeronly fica assessments for unreported tips 

we are subject to federal and state environmental regulations but these rules have not had a material effect on our operations during fiscal 2010 there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated 

our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 “ada” and related state accessibility statutes under the ada and related state laws we must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment and when constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of our restaurants we must make those facilities accessible 

we are subject to laws and regulations relating to nutritional content nutritional labeling product safety and menu labeling 

we are reviewing the health care reform law enacted by congress in march of 2010 as part of that review we will evaluate the potential impacts of this new law on our business and accommodate various parts of the law as they take effect 

see item 1a “risk factors” below for a discussion of risks relating to federal state and local regulation of our business including in the areas of health care reform and environmental matters

 item 1a risk factors tableend various risks and uncertainties could affect our business any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations therefore the following is not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

food safety and foodborne illness concerns throughout the supply chain may have an adverse effect on our business 

food safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our customers enjoy safe quality food products however food safety issues could be caused by food suppliers or distributors and as a result be out of our control in addition regardless of the source or cause any report of foodborne illnesses such as e coli hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination at one of our restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our brands and have a negative impact on our sales even instances of foodborne illness food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales the occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients resulting in higher costs and lower margins 

litigation including allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees guests suppliers shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation these actions and proceedings may involve allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices including wage and hour violations and employment discrimination guest discrimination food safety issues including poor food quality foodborne illness food tampering food contamination and adverse health effects from consumption of various food products or highcalorie foods including obesity other personal injury violation of “dram shop” laws providing an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or a third party trademark infringement violation of the federal securities laws or other concerns the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time the cost to defend litigation may be significant there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of our brands regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are found liable litigation could impact our operations in other ways as well allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices for example could adversely affect employee acquisition and retention as a result litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

unfavorable publicity or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could harm our reputation and adversely impact our guest counts and sales 

the good reputation of our restaurant brands is a key factor in the success of our business actual or alleged incidents at any of our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could harm our brands even incidents occurring at restaurants operated by our competitors or in the supply chain generally could result in negative publicity that could harm the restaurant industry overall and indirectly our own brands negative publicity may result from allegations of illegal unfair or inconsistent employment practices guest discrimination illness injury or any of the other matters discussed above that could give rise to litigation regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants or only to a single restaurant could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand negative publicity also may result from health concerns including food safety and flu outbreaks publication of government or industry findings concerning food products environmental disasters crime incidents scandals involving our employees or operational problems at our restaurants all of which could make our brands and menu offerings less appealing to our guests and negatively impact our guest counts and sales adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of our brands or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to a number of risks relating to federal state and local regulation of our business including in the areas of health care reform and environmental matters and an insufficient or ineffective response to government regulation may impact our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability 

the restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including those relating to food safety minimum wage and other labor issues including unionization health care menu labeling and building and zoning requirements the development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites which are subject to zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations and requirements we are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health sanitation safety and fire standards and liquor licenses federal and state laws governing our relationships with employees including the fair labor standards act of 1938 the immigration reform and control act of 1986 and applicable requirements concerning the minimum wage overtime family leave tip credits working conditions safety standards and immigration status federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities such as the americans with disabilities act of 1990 in addition we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge emission and disposal of hazardous materials 

we are reviewing the health care reform law enacted by congress in march of 2010 as part of that review we will evaluate the potential impacts of this new law on our business and accommodate various parts of the law as they take effect there are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can accommodate all of the costs associated with compliance we did not receive taxfree subsidies for providing prescription drugs to retirees under medicare part d therefore we have no deferred tax assets associated with our retiree medical plan that would be impacted by this law we do not expect to incur any material costs from compliance with the provision of the health care law requiring disclosure of calories on menus but cannot anticipate any changes in guest behavior resulting from the implementation of this portion of the law which could have an adverse effect on our sales or results of operations 

there also has been increasing focus by us and overseas governmental authorities on environmental matters such as climate change the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption this increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters such as the emission of greenhouse gases where “cap and trade” initiatives could effectively impose a tax on carbon emissions legislative regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials taxes transportation and utilities which could decrease our operating profits and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment 

the impact of current laws and regulations the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues could increase our cost structure operational efficiencies and talent availability and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal state and local authorities could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings 

we may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs 

our restaurant operations are subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages working conditions overtime and tip credits as federal and state minimum wage rates increase we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage labor shortages increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs this in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales conversely if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices our profitability may decline in addition the current premiums that we pay for our insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property health and directors’ and officers’ liability may increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs the dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers’ compensation and general liability insurance for which we carry high perclaim deductibles may also increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs further the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses 

we rely heavily on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or breach of security of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

we rely heavily on information systems across our operations including for management of our supply chain pointofsale processing system in our restaurants and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations and significant capital investments could be required to remediate the problem 

health concerns arising from foodrelated pandemics outbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

the united states and other countries have experienced or may experience in the future outbreaks of viruses such as norovirus avian flu or “sars” and h1n1 or “swine flu” or other diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy commonly known as “mad cow disease” to the extent that a virus or disease is foodborne or perceived to be foodborne future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product for example health concerns relating to the consumption of beef or to specific events such as an outbreak of “mad cow disease” may adversely impact sales at longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille restaurants that offer beef as a primary menu item in addition public concern over avian flu may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry the inability to serve beef or poultrybased products would restrict our ability to provide a variety of menu items to our guests if we change a restaurant menu in response to such concerns we may lose customers who do not prefer the new menu and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new customer base to produce the sales needed to make the restaurant profitable we also may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of such a change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors if a virus is transmitted by human contact our employees or guests could become infected or could choose or be advised to avoid gathering in public places any of which could adversely affect our restaurant guest traffic and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level we also could be adversely affected if jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business 

  

we face intense competition and if we are unable to continue to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

the full service dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing service location personnel and type and quality of food and there are many wellestablished competitors we compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locallyowned restaurants we also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services particularly in the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section we compete primarily on the quality variety and value perception of menu items the number and location of restaurants type of brand quality and efficiency of service attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors we anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors if we are unable to continue to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our failure to drive sufficient profitable sales growth through brand relevance operating excellence opening new restaurants and developing or acquiring new dining brands could result in poor financial performance 

as part of our business strategy we intend to drive profitable sales growth by increasing samerestaurant sales at existing restaurants continuing to expand our current portfolio of restaurant brands and developing or acquiring additional brands that can be expanded profitably this strategy involves numerous risks and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives we may not be able to maintain brand relevance and restaurant operating excellence at existing brands to achieve sustainable samerestaurant sales growth and warrant new unit growth in addition we may not be able to open all of our planned new restaurants and the new restaurants that we open may not be profitable or as profitable as our existing restaurants new restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize and even sales at successful newlyopened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation the opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on sales levels at existing restaurants furthermore we may not be able to develop or acquire additional brands that are as profitable as our existing restaurants growth through acquisitions may involve additional risks for example we may pay too much for a brand relative to the actual economic return be required to borrow funds to make our acquisition which would increase our interest expense or be unable to successfully integrate an acquired brand into our operations 

the ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations the need to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses on a timely basis the need to comply with other regulatory requirements the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay construction increases in labor and building material costs the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms changes in weather or other acts of god that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions at each potential location we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites construction contractors management personnel hourly employees and other resources if we are unable to successfully manage these risks we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated sales and earnings in future periods 

we incurred substantial additional indebtedness to finance the rare acquisition which may decrease our business flexibility and increase our borrowing costs 

we incurred substantial additional indebtedness to finance the rare acquisition although our adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio has fallen to near preacquisition levels it remains higher than it was before the acquisition our increased indebtedness and higher adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio as compared to that which existed on a historical basis may have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs 

our level of indebtedness could have important consequences for example it may 

  

   there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity a default under our debt instruments may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

our plans to expand our newer brands bahama breeze and seasons 52 that have not yet proven their longterm viability may not be successful which could require us to make substantial further investments in those brands and result in losses and impairments 

while each of our restaurant brands as well as each of our individual restaurants are subject to the risks and uncertainties described above there is an enhanced level of risk and uncertainty related to the operation and expansion of our newer brands such as bahama breeze and seasons 52 these brands have not yet proven their longterm viability or growth potential we have made substantial investments in the development and expansion of each of these brands and further investment is required while we have implemented a number of changes to operations at bahama breeze and believe we have improved the guest experience and unit economics sufficiently to restart modest unit growth and opened one new restaurant in each of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 there can be no assurance that these changes will continue to be successful or that additional new unit growth will occur seasons 52 also is in the very early stages of its development and will require additional resources to support further growth in each case these brands will continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties that accompany any emerging restaurant brand 

a lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

the success of our restaurants depends in large part on their locations as demographic and economic patterns change current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations in addition desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation the occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may experience higherthananticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants we incur substantial preopening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close relocate or remodel existing restaurants the expenses of opening closing relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated an increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

if our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions if our advertising media or marketing expenses increase or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our 

  

competitors we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations inadequate or ineffective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales 

a failure to develop and recruit effective leaders the loss of key personnel or a significant shortage of highquality restaurant employees could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

our future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other employees our future growth also depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain highquality employees to work in and manage our restaurants we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees in order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth a failure to maintain leadership excellence and build adequate bench strength a loss of key employees or a significant shortage of highquality restaurant employees could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

the price and availability of key food products ingredients and utilities used by our restaurants and a failure to achieve economies of scale in purchasing could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food ingredients utilities and other related costs over which we may have little control operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities including shrimp lobster crab and other seafood as well as beef pork chicken cheese and produce the introduction of or changes to tariffs on imported shrimp or other food products could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products we attempt to leverage our size to achieve economies of scale in purchasing but there can be no assurances that we can always do so effectively we are subject to the general risks of inflation our restaurants’ operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as electricity and natural gas whether as a result of inflation or otherwise on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply in addition interruptions to the availability of gas electric water or other utilities whether due to aging infrastructure weather conditions fire animal damage trees digging accidents or other reasons largely out of our control may adversely affect our operations some climatologists predict that the longterm effects of climate change may result in more severe volatile weather our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

we may lose sales or incur increased costs if our restaurants experience shortages or interruptions in the delivery of food and other products from our third party vendors and suppliers 

possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants caused by inclement weather natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes the inability of our vendors to obtain credit in a tightened credit market or remain solvent given disruptions in the financial markets or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants we may have a limited number of suppliers for certain of our products supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our restaurant operations if we temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular items from a restaurant’s menu that restaurant may experience a significant reduction in sales during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our customers changing their dining habits 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to hedge exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we use or may use derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs including but not limited to coffee wheat soybean oil pork beef and natural gas changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings included in our consolidated financial statements we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

  

certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and other general macroeconomic factors including unemployment energy prices and interest rates that are largely out of our control may adversely affect our results of operations 

our business results depend on a number of industryspecific and general economic factors many of which are beyond our control the full service dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in national regional and local economic conditions seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant brands the performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends severe weather including hurricanes traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants 

general economic conditions may also adversely affect our results of operations recessionary economic cycles such as the one currently being experienced in the us and many other global economies a protracted economic slowdown a worsening economy increased unemployment increased energy prices rising interest rates or other industrywide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings job losses foreclosures bankruptcies and falling home prices could cause customers to make fewer discretionary purchases and any significant decrease in our customer traffic or average profit per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance in addition if gasoline natural gas electricity and other energy costs increase and credit card home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine out may spend less on each dining out occasion or may choose more inexpensive restaurants 

furthermore we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts terrorist attacks efforts to combat terrorism heightened security requirements or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems could have on our operations the economy or consumer confidence generally any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures 

unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our customers could increase our costs reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact consumer spending patterns affect the availability and cost of credit and increase pension plan expenses 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control global credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil recently characterized by the bankruptcy failure or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states and other governments these events may adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future there can be no assurances that we will be able to arrange credit on terms we believe are acceptable or that permit us to finance our business with historical margins the lack of credit along with the macroeconomic factors previously discussed may have an adverse impact on certain of our suppliers landlords and other tenants in retail centers in which we are located if these issues continue or worsen they could further materially impact these parties which in turn could negatively affect our financial results any new or continuing disruptions in the financial markets may also adversely affect the us and world economy which could negatively impact consumer spending patterns there can be no assurances as to how or when this period of turmoil will be resolved changes in the capital markets could also have significant effects on our pension plan our pension income or expense is affected by factors including the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for the pension plans for some of our employees the weighted average asset allocation and longterm rate of return of our pension plan assets the discount rate used to determine the service and interest cost components of our net periodic pension cost and assumed rates of increase in our employees’ future compensation if our pension plan assets do not achieve positive rates of return or if our estimates 

  

and assumed rates are not accurate our earnings may decrease because net periodic pension costs would rise and we could be required to provide additional funds to cover our obligations to employees under the pension plan 

impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired we test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit if the carrying value is less than the fair value no impairment exists if the carrying value is higher than the fair value there is an indication of impairment a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment exists factors may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and slower growth rates any adverse change in these factors would have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations we compute the amount of impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we are required to record a noncash impairment charge if the testing performed indicates that goodwill has been impaired 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets primarily the longhorn steakhouse® and the capital grille® trademarks to determine if they are definite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

as with goodwill we test our indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trade names for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable we estimate the fair value of the trademarks based on an income valuation model using the relief from royalty method which requires assumptions related to projected sales from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademarks and a discount rate 

we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

failure of our internal controls over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud our growth and acquisition of other restaurant companies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud a significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock

 strategy 

the restaurant industry is generally considered to be comprised of two segments quick service and full service the full service segment is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains we believe that capable operators of strong multiunit concepts have the opportunity to increase their share of the full service segment we plan to grow by increasing the number of restaurants in each of our existing concepts and by developing or acquiring additional concepts that can be expanded profitably 

while we are a leader in the full service dining segment we know we cannot be successful without a clear sense of who we are our core purpose is “to nourish and delight everyone we serve” this core purpose is supported by our core values 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

our mission is to be “the best in full service dining now and for generations” we believe we can achieve this goal by continuing to build on our strategy to be a brandbuilding company which is focused on

bahama breeze restaurants bring guests the feeling of a caribbean escape offering the food drinks and atmosphere found in the islands the menu features distinctive caribbeaninspired fresh seafood chicken and steaks as well as signature specialty drinks the first bahama breeze opened in 1996 and met with strong positive consumer response we continued to test the concept by opening a limited number of additional restaurants in each of the following years and began national expansion of the concept in 1998 the concept was well received by guests but due to weakerthanexpected financial performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 bahama breeze closed six restaurants and wrote down the carrying value of four others this action reduced the total number of restaurants in operation to 32 and all new restaurant expansion was postponed 

since fiscal 2004 bahama breeze has implemented changes to become a more relevant brand for its guests evolve its menu to make it more approachable yet still distinctive and improve the guest experience while lowering its operating costs in fiscal 2007 bahama breeze wrote down the carrying value of five restaurants and closed nine but improved the guest experience and unit economics sufficiently at the remaining restaurants that we have restarted modest unit growth with one restaurant opened in fiscal 2009 in wayne new jersey and one projected new restaurant opening in jacksonville florida in fiscal 2010 the results of operations of the nine closed restaurants are reported as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements

discontinued operations 

in fiscal 2007 we announced the closure of 54 smokey bones barbeque  grill restaurants and two rocky river grillhouse restaurants and subsequently sold the remaining 73 operating smokey bones restaurants during fiscal 2008 also in fiscal 2007 we closed nine bahama breeze restaurants the results of operations for these restaurants are treated as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

  

recent and planned growth 

on a continuing operations basis during fiscal 2009 we opened 71 net new restaurants our actual and projected net new openings from continuing operations by concept are shown below 

 

 the actual number of openings for each of our concepts will depend on many factors including our ability to locate appropriate sites negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms obtain necessary local governmental permits complete construction and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel our objective is to continue to expand all of our restaurant concepts and to develop or acquire additional concepts that can be expanded profitably we have continued to test new ideas and concepts and also to evaluate potential acquisition candidates to assess whether they would satisfy our strategic and financial objectives 

we consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant’s longterm success and we devote significant effort to the site selection process prior to entering a market we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors these factors include trade area demographics such as target population density and household income levels competitive influences in the trade area the site’s visibility accessibility and traffic volume and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls hotelmotel complexes offices and universities members of senior management evaluate inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after permits are obtained and the site is acquired 

the following table illustrates the approximate average capital investment size and dining capacity of the 15 red lobster restaurants 12 new restaurants and three relocations 41 olive garden restaurants 38 new restaurants and three relocations and the 21 longhorn steakhouse restaurants all new and no relocations opened during fiscal 2009 the table excludes any rebuilt restaurants 

 

  

  

  

  

 we systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards when a restaurant falls below minimum standards we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes and implement marketing and operational plans to improve that restaurant’s performance if performance does not improve to acceptable levels the restaurant is evaluated for relocation closing or conversion to one of our other concepts 

  

as discussed above under “discontinued operations” we sold or closed a number of restaurants during fiscal 2007 and 2008 while not included in discontinued operations in fiscal 2008 we permanently closed three red lobster restaurants one olive garden restaurant and following the acquisition of rare on october 1 2007 one longhorn steakhouse restaurant during fiscal 2009 we permanently closed three red lobster restaurants one olive garden restaurant five longhorn steakhouse restaurants and no the capital grille bahama breeze or seasons 52 restaurants we continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges 

restaurant operations 

we believe that highquality restaurant management is critical to our longterm success our restaurant management structure varies by concept and restaurant size we issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards 

each typical red lobster olive garden bahama breeze and seasons 52 restaurant is led by a general manager and three to five additional managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant each restaurant also employs approximately 50185 hourly employees most of who work parttime restaurant general managers report to multi unit supervisors who are directors of operations or regional directors at the end of fiscal 2009 each multi unit supervisor was responsible for approximately six to 10 restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by all levels of supervision to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards 

the management staff of a typical longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille restaurant consists of one managing partner one to four assistant managers and one or two kitchen managers in addition each of these restaurants employs approximately 40 to 80 hourly employees the managing partner of each restaurant reports directly to a multi unit supervisor who may be a director of operations or regional director multi unit supervisors have operational responsibility for approximately three to nine restaurants regional directors at the capital grille also have responsibility for the old grist mill tavern and hemenway’s seafood grille  oyster bar restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by all levels of supervision to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards 

each concept’s head of training together with senior operations executives are responsible for developing and maintaining that concept’s operations training programs these efforts include a 12 to 15week training program for management trainees and continuing development programs for managers supervisors and directors the emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant concept but includes leadership restaurant business management and culinary skills we also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants including deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations the opening training teams typically begin work one week prior to opening and remain at the new restaurant for up to three weeks after the opening they are redeployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant’s operating staff 

we maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our managementlevel employees we believe that our leadership position strong successoriented culture and various shortterm and longterm incentive programs including stock units help attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers with the acquisition of rare we also have continued a managing partner program in which qualifying general managers of longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille restaurants receive cash compensation and restricted stock awards based upon individual performance 

quality assurance 

our total quality department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe highquality food in a clean and safe environment through rigorous physical evaluation and testing at our north american laboratories and through “point source inspection” by our international team of quality specialists in several foreign countries we purchase only seafood that meets or exceeds our specifications we use independent third parties to inspect and evaluate commodity vendors in addition any commodity supplier that produces a “high risk” product is subject to a food safety evaluation by darden personnel at least annually we require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive hazard analysis and critical control point “haccp” food safety 

  

programs adopted by the us food and drug administration the haccp programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause foodborne illnesses by applying scientificallybased controls to analyze hazards identify and monitor critical control points and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met since 1976 we have required routine microbiological testing of seafood and other commodities for quality and microbiological safety in addition our total quality managers and third party auditors visit each restaurant periodically throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation the total quality managers also serve as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety this haccp program has now been expanded to include both longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille operations as part of the integration of rare 

purchasing and distribution 

our ability to ensure a consistent supply of highquality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant concepts depends on reliable sources of procurement our purchasing staff sources negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 2000 suppliers in more than 30 countries suppliers must meet strict quality control standards in the development harvest catch and production of food products competitive bids longterm contracts and longterm vendor relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products 

we believe that our seafood purchasing capabilities are a significant competitive advantage our purchasing staff travels routinely within the united states and internationally to source more than 100 varieties of topquality seafood at competitive prices we believe that we have established excellent longterm relationships with key seafood vendors and usually source our product directly from producers not brokers or middlemen we operate procurement offices in yantai china and toronto canada our only purchasing offices outside of orlando florida to source products directly from asia and canada while the supply of certain seafood species is volatile we believe we have the ability to identify alternative seafood products and to adjust our menus as necessary all other essential food products are available or can be made available upon short notice from alternative qualified suppliers because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales controlled inventories of specified products are distributed to restaurants through independent national distribution companies in addition through strategic alliances between our subsidiary darden direct distribution inc and these distribution companies we maintain inventory ownership and dedicated operations in select environments enhancing our supply chain’s competitive advantage 

our supplier diversity program is an integral part of our purchasing efforts through this program we identify minority and womenowned vendors and assist them in establishing supplier relationships with us we are committed to the development and growth of minority and womenowned enterprises and in fiscal 2009 we spent approximately 80 percent and 43 percent respectively of our purchasing dollars with those firms 

we continue to invest in new technologies to improve our purchasing and restaurant operations we are in the process of expanding “ikitchen” a webbased software system to our regional suppliers the system is designed to more efficiently handle restaurant product orders receiving invoice approval and inventories 

advertising and marketing 

we believe we have developed significant marketing and advertising capabilities our size enables us to be a leading advertiser in the full service dining segment of the restaurant industry red lobster and olive garden leverage the efficiency of national network television advertising and supplement it with local television advertising longhorn steakhouse the capital grille bahama breeze and seasons 52 do not use national television advertising our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to attract customers we implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase our sales and profits we also rely on outdoor billboard and direct mail advertising as well as radio newspaper and direct mail coupon programs as appropriate to attract customers we have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor customer satisfaction and evolving expectations 

  

employees 

at the end of fiscal 2009 we employed approximately 179000 persons of these employees approximately 1400 were corporate or restaurant concept personnel located in our restaurant support center in orlando florida approximately 7800 were restaurant management personnel in the restaurants or in field offices and the remainder were hourly restaurant personnel of the corporate and restaurant concept personnel located at our restaurant support center in orlando approximately 62 percent were management personnel and the balance were administrative or office employees our operating executives have an average of more than 14 years of experience with us the restaurant general managers average 12 years with us we believe that we provide working conditions and compensation that compare favorably with those of our competitors most employees other than restaurant management and corporate management are paid on an hourly basis none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our employee relations to be good 

information technology 

we strive for leadership in the restaurant business by using technology as a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy since 1975 computers located in the restaurants have been used to assist in the management of the restaurants we have implemented systems targeted at improved financial control cost management enhanced guest service and improved employee effectiveness management information systems are designed to be used across restaurant concepts yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant concepts these management information systems include a suite of webenabled and fully integrated financial and human resource including payroll and benefits systems and a highspeed data network connecting all restaurants to all current and anticipated future applications several years ago we implemented “dash” a next generation technology platform for our restaurant point of sale system in olive garden red lobster bahama breeze and seasons 52 restaurants and a new meal pacing system in olive garden and red lobster restaurants the new meal pacing system is designed to properly pace the preparation of menu items based on cooktimes to enhance the guest’s experience and enhance restaurant capacity by increasing table turns 

in the past year we essentially completed integrating the longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille restaurant businesses into the company’s core business processes and applications the “dash” point of sale system implementation was completed in june 2009 during the past year we also implemented a webbased labor management system in olive garden restaurants which has been in use for some time at red lobster and bahama breeze and moved substantially all of our data center and network operations to the new data center located at the new restaurant support center campus 

restaurant hardware and software support for all of our restaurant concepts including the newly integrated longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille concepts is provided or coordinated from the restaurant support center in orlando florida seven days a week 24 hours a day a communications network sends and receives critical business data to and from the restaurants throughout the day and night providing timely and extensive information on business activity in every location the new restaurant support center houses our data center which contains sufficient computing power to process information from all restaurants quickly and efficiently our information is processed in a secure environment to protect both the actual data and the physical assets we guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan which includes storing critical business information offsite testing the disaster recovery plan at a hostsite facility and providing onsite power backup via a large diesel generator we use internally developed proprietary software as well as purchased software with proven nonproprietary hardware this allows processing power to be distributed effectively to each of our restaurants 

as noted above under “purchasing and distribution” we are in the process of expanding “ikitchen” to our regional suppliers during fiscal 2010 we will begin efforts to strengthen existing tools used to forecast demand for product level information throughout the supply chain 

our management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates will position us well to support current needs and future growth we are committed to maintaining an industry leadership position in information systems and computing technology we use a strategic information systems planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic financial regulatory and other business advantage criteria 

  

competition 

the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food price service restaurant location personnel concept attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing the restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing restaurants and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power we compete within each market with national and regional chains and locallyowned restaurants for customers management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites we also face growing competition from the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section we expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas 

other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled “purchasing and distribution” “advertising and marketing” and “information technology” in this item 1 and in our risk factors in item 1a of this form 10k 

trademarks service marks franchises and joint ventures 

we regard our darden restaurants ®  red lobster ®  olive garden ®  longhorn steakhouse ®  the capital grille ®  bahama breeze ®  and seasons 52 ® service marks and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and as being important to our marketing efforts our policy is to pursue registration of our important service marks and trademarks and to oppose vigorously any infringement of them generally with appropriate renewal and use the registration of our service marks and trademarks will continue indefinitely 

all but three of our 1773 restaurants in operation at may 31 2009 are companyowned and operated those three restaurants are located in central florida and are owned by joint ventures managed by us the joint ventures pay management fees to us and we control the joint ventures’ use of our service marks we have one unaffiliated franchisee with the right under an area development and franchise agreement to operate franchised longhorn steakhouse restaurants in puerto rico as of may 31 2009 this franchisee operated five longhorn steakhouse restaurants in puerto rico our only restaurant operations outside of north america are conducted through an area development and franchise agreement with an unaffiliated japanese corporation this corporation operated 25 red lobster restaurants in japan as of may 31 2009 we do not have an ownership interest in this corporation but we receive royalty income under the franchise agreement the amount of income we derive from these joint venture and franchise arrangements is not material to our consolidated financial statements 

seasonality 

our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally during fiscal 2009 our average sales per restaurant were highest in the summer and spring followed by the winter and lowest in the fall during fiscal 2008 and 2007 our average sales per restaurant were highest in the spring and winter followed by the summer and lowest in the fall holidays severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions because of the seasonality of our business results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

government regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws affecting our business each of our restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities which include health safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located the development and operation of restaurants depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites which are subject to zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations to date we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals 

during fiscal 2009 91 percent of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site in most cases on an annual basis and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time these regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant operation including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours of operation advertising wholesale purchasing 

  

inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages the failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these licenses would adversely affect the restaurant’s operations we also are subject in certain states to “dramshop” statutes which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person who then causes injury to himself or a third party we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance 

we also are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws governing such matters as overtime tip credits working conditions safety standards and hiring and employment practices changes in these laws during fiscal 2009 have not had a material effect on our operations 

we currently are operating under a tip rate alternative commitment “trac” agreement with the internal revenue service through increased educational and other efforts in the restaurants the trac agreement reduces the likelihood of potential chainwide employeronly fica assessments for unreported tips 

we are subject to federal and state environmental regulations but these rules have not had a material effect on our operations during fiscal 2009 there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated 

our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 “ada” and related state accessibility statutes under the ada and related state laws we must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment and when constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of our restaurants we must make those facilities accessible 

we are subject to laws and regulations relating to nutritional content nutritional labeling product safety and menu labeling multijurisdictional regulations relating to nutritional labeling may lead to increased operational complexity and expenses and may impact guest behavior

 item 1a risk factors tableend various risks and uncertainties could affect our business any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations therefore the following is not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to continue to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

the full service dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing service location personnel and type and quality of food and there are many wellestablished competitors we compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locallyowned restaurants we also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services particularly in the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section we compete primarily on the quality variety and value perception of menu items the number and location of restaurants type of concept quality and efficiency of service attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors we anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors if we are unable to continue to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and certain general economic factors including unemployment energy prices and interest rates that are largely out of our control may adversely affect our results of operations 

our business results depend on a number of industryspecific and general economic factors many of which are beyond our control the full service dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in national regional and local economic conditions seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant concepts the performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends severe weather including hurricanes traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants 

general economic conditions may also adversely affect our results of operations recessionary economic cycles such as the one currently being experienced in the us and many other global economies a protracted economic slowdown a worsening economy increased unemployment increased energy prices rising interest rates or other industrywide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings job losses foreclosures bankruptcies and falling home prices could cause customers to make fewer discretionary purchases and any significant decrease in our customer traffic or average profit per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance in addition if gasoline natural gas electricity and other energy costs increase and credit card home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine out may spend less on each dining out occasion or may choose more inexpensive restaurants 

  

furthermore we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts terrorist attacks efforts to combat terrorism heightened security requirements or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems could have on our operations the economy or consumer confidence generally any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures 

unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our customers could increase our costs reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the price and availability of food ingredients and utilities used by our restaurants could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food ingredients utilities and other related costs over which we may have little control operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities including shrimp lobster crab and other seafood as well as beef pork chicken cheese and produce the introduction of or changes to tariffs on imported shrimp or other food products could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products we are subject to the general risks of inflation our restaurants’ operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as electricity and natural gas whether as a result of inflation or otherwise on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply in addition interruptions to the availability of gas electric water or other utilities whether due to aging infrastructure weather conditions fire animal damage trees digging accidents or other reasons largely out of our control may adversely affect our operations our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may lose revenue or incur increased costs if our restaurants experience shortages or interruptions in the delivery of food and other products from our third party vendors and suppliers 

possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants caused by inclement weather natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes the inability of our vendors to obtain credit in a tightened credit market or remain solvent given disruptions in the financial markets or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants we may have a limited number of suppliers for certain of our products supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our restaurant operations if we temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular items from a restaurant’s menu that restaurant may experience a significant reduction in revenue during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our customers changing their dining habits 

we may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs 

our restaurant operations are subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages working conditions overtime and tip credits as federal and state minimum wage rates increase we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage labor shortages increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs this in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales conversely if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices our profitability may decline in addition the current premiums that we pay for our insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property health and directors’ and officers’ liability may increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs the dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers’ compensation and general liability insurance for which we carry high perclaim deductibles may also increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs further the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses 

  

the loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

our future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other employees our future growth also depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage our restaurants we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our projected growth a loss of key employees or a significant shortage of high quality restaurant employees could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

we rely heavily on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or breach of security of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

we rely heavily on information systems across our operations including for management of our supply chain pointofsale processing in our restaurants and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations and significant capital investments could be required to remediate the problem 

increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

if our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions if our advertising media or marketing expenses increase or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may experience higherthananticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our revenues and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants we incur substantial preopening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close relocate or remodel existing restaurants the expenses of opening closing relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated an increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees consumers suppliers shareholders or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time the cost to defend future litigation may be significant there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of our services regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable as a result litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable publicity could harm our business 

multiunit restaurant businesses such as ours can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from complaints or litigation or general publicity regarding poor food quality foodborne illness personal injury food tampering adverse health effects of consumption of various food products or highcalorie foods including obesity or other concerns negative publicity may also result from actual or alleged violations by our restaurants of “dram shop” laws which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or to a third party regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants or only to a single restaurant could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of food safety or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

health concerns arising from outbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business 

the united states and other countries have experienced or may experience in the future outbreaks of viruses such as norovirus avian flu or “sars” and h1n1 or “swine flu” or other diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy commonly known as “mad cow disease” to the extent that a virus or disease is foodborne or perceived to be foodborne future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product for example health concerns relating to the consumption of beef or to specific events such as the outbreak of “mad cow disease” may adversely impact sales at longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille restaurants that offer beef as a primary menu item in addition public concern over “avian flu” may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry the inability to serve beef or poultrybased products would restrict our ability to provide a variety of menu items to our guests if we change a restaurant concept or menu in response to such concerns we may lose customers who do not prefer the new concept or menu and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new customer base to produce the revenue needed to make the restaurant profitable we also may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of such a concept change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors if a virus is transmitted by human contact our employees or guests could become infected or could choose or be advised to avoid gathering in public places any of which could adversely affect our restaurant guest traffic and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level we also could be adversely affected if jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business 

a lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

the success of our restaurants depends in large part on their location as demographic and economic patterns change current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced revenues in those locations in addition desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation the occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

we are subject to a number of risks relating to federal state and local regulation of our business that may increase our costs and decrease our profit margins 

the restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including those relating to building and zoning requirements and those relating to the preparation and sale of food the development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites which are subject to zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations and requirements we are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health sanitation safety and fire standards and liquor licenses federal and state laws governing our relationships with employees including the fair labor standards act of 1938 the immigration reform and control act of 1986 and applicable requirements concerning the minimum wage overtime family leave tip credits working conditions safety standards and immigration status federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities such as the americans with disabilities act of 1990 in addition we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge emission and disposal of hazardous materials at the federal level it is uncertain what impact efforts to reform the health care system could have on our business and whether it would result in affordable health care for our employees or raise costs for both taxpayers and businesses we also face risks from new and changing laws and regulations relating to nutritional content nutritional labeling product safety and menu labeling some states and localities have adopted or are considering policies that would require restaurants to provide calorie and other nutrition information on menus and menu boards legislation also may be considered at the federal level that would seek to establish a uniform nationwide approach detailing what information restaurants must provide the impact of current laws and regulations the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or 

  

future laws and regulations or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal state and local authorities could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings 

our growth through the opening of new restaurants and the development or acquisition of new dining concepts may not be successful and could result in poor financial performance 

as part of our business strategy we intend to continue to expand our current portfolio of restaurant concepts and to develop or acquire additional concepts that can be expanded profitably this strategy involves numerous risks and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives we may not be able to open all of our planned new restaurants and the new restaurants that we open may not be profitable or as profitable as our existing restaurants new restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize and even sales at successful newlyopened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation the opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on sales levels at existing restaurants furthermore we may not be able to develop or acquire additional concepts that are as profitable as our existing restaurants growth through acquisitions may involve additional risks for example we may pay too much for a concept relative to the actual economic return be required to borrow funds to make our acquisition which would increase our interest expense or be unable to integrate an acquired concept into our operations 

the ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations the need to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses on a timely basis the need to comply with other regulatory requirements the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay construction increases in labor and building material costs the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms changes in weather or other acts of god that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions at each potential location we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites construction contractors management personnel hourly employees and other resources if we are unable to successfully manage these risks we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues and earnings in future periods 

our plans to expand our newer concepts bahama breeze and seasons 52 that have not yet proven their longterm viability may not be successful which could require us to make substantial further investments in those concepts and result in losses and impairments 

while each of our restaurant concepts as well as each of our individual restaurants are subject to the risks and uncertainties described above there is an enhanced level of risk and uncertainty related to the operation and expansion of our newer concepts such as bahama breeze and seasons 52 these concepts have not yet proven their longterm viability or growth potential we have made substantial investments in the development and expansion of each of these concepts and further investment is required while we have implemented a number of changes to operations at bahama breeze and believe we have improved the guest experience and unit economics sufficiently to restart modest unit growth in fiscal 2009 there can be no assurance that these changes will continue to be successful or that new unit growth will occur seasons 52 also is in the very early stages of its development and will require additional resources to support further growth in each case these brands will continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties that accompany any emerging restaurant concept 

we may not realize the full anticipated benefits of the rare acquisition 

there can be no assurance that the rare acquisition will result in the realization of the full anticipated benefits we acquired rare with the expectation that the acquisition will result in various benefits for the combined company including among others business and growth opportunities and significant synergies from 

  

increased efficiency and effectiveness in purchasing distribution and other restaurant and corporate support however we may not be able to realize the full synergies goodwill business opportunities and growth prospects anticipated in connection with the acquisition we may experience increased competition that limits our ability to expand our business and may not be able to capitalize on expected business opportunities if general industry and business conditions deteriorate achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors if these factors limit our ability to achieve the full anticipated benefits of the acquisition our expectations of future results of operations including the synergies expected to result from the acquisition may not be met if such difficulties are encountered or if such synergies business opportunities and growth prospects are not realized our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

an impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired we test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit if the carrying value is less than the fair value no impairment exists if the carrying value is higher than the fair value there is an indication of impairment a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment exists factors may include among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit and slower growth rates any adverse change in these factors would have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations we compute the amount of impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we are required to record a noncash impairment charge if the testing performed indicates that goodwill has been impaired 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets primarily the longhorn steakhouse ® and the capital grille ® trademarks to determine if they are definite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

as with goodwill we test our indefinitelived intangible assets primarily tradenames for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable we estimate the fair value of the trademarks based on an income valuation model using the relief from royalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademarks and a discount rate 

we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 

we incurred substantial additional indebtedness to finance the rare acquisition which may decrease our business flexibility and increase our borrowing costs 

our consolidated indebtedness following the rare acquisition is substantially greater than our indebtedness prior to the acquisition the increased indebtedness and higher debttoequity ratio of our company as compared to that which existed on a historical basis will have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs 

  

our level of indebtedness could have important consequences for example it may 

 

  

  

 there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity a default under our debt instruments may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

failure of our internal controls over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud our growth and acquisition of other restaurant companies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud a significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock 

disruptions in the financial markets may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit and consumer spending patterns and may increase pension plan expenses 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control global credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil in recent months characterized by the bankruptcy failure or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states and other governments these events may adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future there can be no assurances that we will be able to arrange credit on terms we believe are acceptable or that permit us to finance our business with historical margins these events have also adversely affected the us and world economy and any new or continuing disruptions in the financial markets may also adversely affect the us and world economy which could negatively impact consumer spending patterns there can be no assurances as to how or when this period of turmoil will be resolved changes in the capital markets could also have significant effects on our pension plan our pension income or expense is affected by factors including the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for the pension plans for some of our employees the weighted average asset allocation and longterm rate of return of our pension plan assets the discount rate used to determine the service and interest cost components of our net periodic pension cost and assumed rates of increase in our employees’ future compensation if our pension plan assets do not achieve positive rates of return or if our estimates and assumed rates are not accurate our earnings may decrease because net periodic pension costs would rise and we could be required to provide additional funds to cover our obligations to employees under the pension plan 

  

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to hedge exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we use or may use derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs including but not limited to coffee wheat soybean oil pork beef and natural gas changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings included in our consolidated financial statements we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments”

of these 1773 restaurants open on may 31 2009 926 were located on owned sites and 847 were located on leased sites the 847 leases are classified as follows 

 

 properties – general 

during fiscal 1999 we formed two subsidiary corporations each of which elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust “reit” under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code these elections limit the activities of both corporations to holding certain real estate assets the formation of these two reits is designed primarily to assist us in managing our real estate portfolio and possibly to provide a vehicle to access capital markets in the future 

both reits are nonpublic reits through our subsidiary companies we indirectly own 100 percent of all voting stock and greater than 995 percent of the total value of each reit for financial reporting purposes both reits are included in our consolidated financial statements 

all of the buildings that make up our executive offices culinary center training facilities and our supporting warehouses in orange county orlando metro area florida are currently leased on june 20 2006 we entered into an agreement to sell and lease back the 10 buildings that we previously owned which comprised the majority of 

  

our current restaurant support center the sale and the commencement of our leases for those buildings occurred in august 2006 the leases for those buildings were recently amended to eliminate additional renewal options and to provide for a termination in late december 2009 

we purchased several adjacent parcels of vacant land in orange county florida and plan to relocate our headquarters to this site construction of the main headquarters building data center and parking deck is nearly complete we expect the restaurant support center campus at this new location to offer a more collaborative and unified environment with additional room for future growth we currently project completing the first phase of this development and relocating to the new restaurant support center during the second quarter of fiscal 2010 

as part of the acquisition of rare we acquired ownership of the former rare executive offices and central training facility located in six office buildings in atlanta georgia we sold one of those buildings the remaining buildings are currently being marketed for sale 

except in limited instances our present restaurant sites and other facilities are not subject to mortgages or encumbrances securing money borrowed by us from outside sources in our opinion our current buildings and equipment generally are in good condition suitable for their purposes and adequate for our current needs see also note 5 “land buildings and equipment net” and note 14 “leases” under notes to consolidated financial statements in our 2009 annual report to shareholders incorporated herein by reference

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend we are subject to private lawsuits administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business a number of these lawsuits proceedings and claims may exist at any given time these matters typically involve claims from guests employees and others related to operational issues common to the restaurant industry and can also involve infringement of or challenges to our trademarks while the resolution of a lawsuit proceeding or claim may have an impact on our financial results for the period in which it is resolved we believe that the final disposition of the lawsuits proceedings and claims in which we are currently involved either individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity the following is a brief description of the more significant of these matters in view of the inherent uncertainties of litigation the outcome of any unresolved matter described below cannot be predicted at this time nor can the amount of any potential loss be reasonably estimated 

like other restaurant companies and retail employers in a few states we have been faced with allegations of purported classwide wage and hour violations in april 2009 a former red lobster employee filed a purported class action in new york state court alleging wage and hour violations and meal and rest break practices in violation of new york law seeking an unspecified amount of damages we believe that our practices were lawful and intend to vigorously defend our position in this action 

in july 2008 an action was filed in california state court by a group of former red lobster managers alleging that the salaried general managers of the restaurants were not paid minimum wage for all hours worked because they were not paid for time spent attending various seminars and conferences in addition the managers claim that they were not provided with rest and meal breaks pursuant to california law the complaint seeks to have the suit certified as a class action although we believe that our policies and practices were lawful following mediation with the plaintiffs we reached a settlement of these claims under for approximately 01 million we accrued this amount during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and expect to pay the settlement amount during fiscal 2010 at the completion of the settlement process 

in august 2008 an action was filed in california state court by a former red lobster server alleging that red lobster’s scheduling practices resulted in failure to properly pay reporting time minimum shift pay as well as to pay minimum wage to provide itemized wage statements and to timely pay employees upon the termination of their employment the complaint sought to have the suit certified as a class action although we believed that our policies and practices were lawful we reached a preliminary settlement of this matter under which we would pay approximately 05 million we paid the settlement amount during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 at the completion of the settlement process 

  

on september 18 2008 the equal employment opportunity commission filed suit in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio alleging that africanamerican employees of the bahama breeze restaurant in beachwood ohio were subjected to discriminatory employment practices in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 and title i of the civil rights act of 1991 the complaint seeks to enjoin the alleged discriminatory practices and seeks compensatory damages for the employees we believe that our practices were lawful and we intend to vigorously defend our position in this action 

on march 13 2008 a purported class action complaint alleging violation of the federal securities laws was filed by an institutional shareholder against darden and certain of our current officers one of whom is also a director in the united states district court for the middle district of florida the complaint was filed on behalf of all purchasers of darden’s common stock between june 19 2007 and december 18 2007 the class the complaint alleges that during that period the defendants issued false and misleading statements in press releases and public filings that misrepresented and failed to disclose certain information and that as a result had no reasonable basis for statements about darden’s prospects and guidance for fiscal 2008 the complaint alleges claims under sections 10b and 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 and rule 10b5 thereunder the plaintiff seeks to recover unspecified damages on behalf of the class darden and the individual defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on july 2 2009 the magistrate judge assigned to the action entered a report and recommendation recommending dismissal of all claims on july 17 2009 the plaintiffs filed an objection to the report and recommendation with the district court judge we intend to vigorously defend our position in this action 

by letter dated may 9 2008 a putative shareholder demanded that our board of directors take action to remedy alleged breaches of fiduciary duty to darden by certain officers and directors the letter contains similar allegations to those in the purported class action described above regarding the alleged issuance of false and misleading statements and omissions regarding darden’s financial results and sales growth on september 10 2008 this same putative shareholder on behalf of nominal defendant darden filed a shareholder derivative civil action in the circuit court of the ninth judicial circuit of orange county florida against darden our board of directors and several of our senior executives including the chief executive officer chief operating officer and chief financial officer the allegations in the complaint arise out of the same facts alleged in the purported class action complaint referenced above in particular the complaint alleges that during the period june 19 2007 and december 18 2007 certain of the defendants issued false and misleading statements in press releases and public filings that misrepresented and failed to disclose certain information about darden’s prospects and earnings guidance for fiscal 2008 and that certain defendants benefited from these false and misleading statements in selling darden stock at an inflated price the complaint seeks to recover in favor of darden damages sustained by darden as a result of the defendants’ alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and the imposition of a constructive trust in favor of darden for the amount of proceeds realized by certain defendants from the sale of darden stock fees and costs as well as equitable relief are also sought the board has formed a special litigation committee to evaluate these claims the shareholder derivative action has been stayed pending the special litigation committee’s review

background 

we opened our first restaurant a red lobster seafood restaurant in lakeland florida in 1968 red lobster was founded by william b darden for whom we are named we were acquired by general mills inc in 1970 in may 1995 we became a separate publicly held company when general mills distributed all outstanding darden stock to general mills’ stockholders 

red lobster has grown from six restaurants in operation at the end of fiscal 1970 to 680 restaurants in north america by the end of fiscal 2008 olive garden an internally developed italian restaurant concept opened 

 

   

its first restaurant in orlando florida in fiscal 1983 and by the end of fiscal 2008 had expanded to 653 restaurants in north america the number of red lobster and olive garden restaurants open at the end of fiscal 2008 remained the same and increased by 39 respectively as compared to the end of fiscal 2007 

bahama breeze is an internally developed concept that provides a caribbean escape offering the food drinks and atmosphere you would find in the islands in fiscal 1996 bahama breeze opened its first restaurant in orlando florida at the end of fiscal 2008 there were 23 bahama breeze restaurants 

seasons 52 is an internally developed concept that provides a casually sophisticated fresh grill and wine bar with seasonally inspired menus offering fresh ingredients to create great tasting meals that are lower in calories than comparable restaurant meals seasons 52 opened its first restaurant in orlando florida in fiscal 2003 at the end of fiscal 2008 there were seven seasons 52 restaurants 

on august 16 2007 we announced that we had entered into an agreement to purchase the common stock of rare hospitality international inc “rare” through a tender offer for 3815 per share in cash to be followed by a merger in which the remaining rare shareholders would each receive 3815 per share in cash or approximately 127 billion in total purchase price in addition as a result of the acquisition we repaid rare’s 25 percent convertible notes for approximately 1348 million including 98 million related to a conversion premium rare owned and operated two principal restaurant concepts longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille of which 288 and 29 locations respectively were in operation as of the date of the acquisition which was completed on october 1 2007 longhorn steakhouse with locations primarily in the eastern half of the united states is a leader in the full service dining steakhouse category and the capital grille with locations in major metropolitan cities in the united states is a leader in the premium steakhouse category rare also had two specialty restaurants hemenway’s seafood grille  oyster bar and the old grist mill tavern that were acquired in the merger the acquired operations are included in our financial statements from the date of the acquisition

the restaurant industry is generally considered to be comprised of two segments quick service and full service the full service segment is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains we believe that capable operators of strong multiunit concepts have the opportunity to increase their share of the full service segment we plan to grow by increasing the number of restaurants in each of our existing concepts and by developing or acquiring additional concepts that can be expanded profitably 

while we are a leader in the full service dining segment we know we cannot be successful without a clear sense of who we are our core purpose is “to nourish and delight everyone we serve” this core purpose is supported by our core values 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

our mission is to be “the best in full service dining now and for generations” we believe we can achieve this goal by continuing to build on our strategy to be a multibrand full service restaurant growth company which is grounded in our commitment to combining 

 

  

  

 our strategic framework also includes two points that we believe separate us from our competition we are committed to

bahama breeze restaurants bring guests the feeling of a caribbean escape offering food drinks and atmosphere you would find in the islands the menu features distinctive caribbeaninspired fresh seafood chicken and steaks as well as signature specialty drinks the first bahama breeze opened in 1996 and met with strong positive consumer response we continued to test the concept by opening a limited number of additional restaurants in each of the following years and began national expansion of the concept in 1998 while the concept continued to be well received by guests its financial performance did not meet our overall expectations and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 bahama breeze closed six restaurants and wrote down the carrying value of four others this action reduced the total number of restaurants in operation to 32 and all new restaurant expansion was postponed 

since fiscal 2004 bahama breeze has implemented changes to become a more relevant brand for its guests evolve its menu to make it more approachable yet still distinctive and improve the guest experience while lowering its operating costs in fiscal 2007 bahama breeze wrote down the carrying value of five restaurants and closed nine but improved the guest experience and unit economics sufficiently at the remaining restaurants that we are restarting modest unit growth with two projected new restaurant openings in fiscal 2009 the results of operations of the nine closed restaurants are reported as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements

seasons 52 

seasons 52 is a casually sophisticated fresh grill and wine bar with seasonally inspired menus offering fresh ingredients to create great tasting meals that are lower in calories than comparable restaurant meals it offers an international wine list of more than 130 wines with 70 available by the glass the first seasons 52 opened in 2003 and currently operates seven existing restaurants with plans to open one new restaurant in fiscal 2009 

discontinued operations 

in fiscal 2007 we announced the closure of 54 smokey bones barbeque  grill restaurants and two rocky river grillhouse restaurants and our intention to offer for sale the remaining 73 operating smokey bones restaurants smokey bones featured barbequed pork beef and chicken as well as other grilled favorites all served 

  

in a lively yet comfortable mountainlodge setting that featured televised sports we opened the first smokey bones in september 1999 and began national expansion of the concept in fiscal 2002 the concept was designed to be a nationally advertised brand but since it was not on a path to achieving that vision we concluded it was not a meaningful growth vehicle for darden from december 2007 through february 2008 we closed the sale of 72 of the smokey bones restaurants the sale of the remaining restaurant was completed in june 2008 also in fiscal 2007 we closed nine bahama breeze restaurants the results of operations for these restaurants are treated as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

recent and planned growth 

on a continuing operations basis during fiscal 2008 we opened 65 new restaurants excluding the relocation of existing restaurants to new sites and the rebuilding of restaurants at existing sites our actual and projected new openings from continuing operations by concept excluding relocations and rebuilds are shown below 

 

  

 the actual number of openings for each of our concepts will depend on many factors including our ability to locate appropriate sites negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms obtain necessary local governmental permits complete construction and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel our objective is to continue to expand all of our restaurant concepts and to develop or acquire additional concepts that can be expanded profitably we have continued to test new ideas and concepts and also to evaluate potential acquisition candidates to assess whether they would satisfy our strategic and financial objectives 

we consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant’s longterm success and we devote significant effort to the site selection process prior to entering a market we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors these factors include trade area demographics such as target population density and household income levels competitive influences in the trade area the site’s visibility accessibility and traffic volume and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls hotelmotel complexes offices and universities members of senior management evaluate inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after permits are obtained and the site is acquired 

the following table illustrates the approximate average capital investment size and dining capacity of the nine red lobster restaurants four new restaurants and five relocations and 41 olive garden restaurants 40 new restaurants and one relocation that were opened during fiscal 2008 and the 18 longhorn steakhouse restaurants 18 new restaurants and no relocations opened during fiscal 2008 since the acquisition of rare on october 1 2007 

 

  

   

  

  

 we systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards when a restaurant falls below minimum standards we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes and implement marketing and operational plans to improve that restaurant’s performance if performance does not improve to acceptable levels the restaurant is evaluated for relocation closing or conversion to one of our other concepts 

during fiscal 2008 as discussed in “discontinued operations” above we sold 72 smokey bones restaurants along with the one smokey bones restaurant that sold in fiscal 2009 during fiscal 2008 we also permanently closed three red lobster restaurants one olive garden restaurant and no bahama breeze or seasons 52 restaurants following the acquisition of rare on october 1 2007 we permanently closed one longhorn steakhouse restaurant and no the capital grille restaurants we continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges 

restaurant operations 

we believe that highquality restaurant management is critical to our longterm success our restaurant management structure varies by concept and restaurant size we issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards 

each red lobster olive garden bahama breeze and seasons 52 restaurant is led by a general manager and three to five additional managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant each restaurant also employs approximately 50185 hourly employees most of whom work parttime restaurant general managers report to multi unit supervisors who may be directors or vice presidents at the end of fiscal 2008 each multi unit supervisor was responsible for approximately six to 10 restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by all levels of supervision to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards 

the management staff of a typical longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille restaurant consists of one managing partner one to four assistant managers and one or two kitchen managers in addition each of these restaurants employs approximately 40 to 80 hourly employees the managing partner of each restaurant reports directly to a multi unit supervisor who may be a regional manager or regional director multi unit supervisors have operational responsibility for approximately three to nine restaurants regional directors at the capital grille also have responsibility for the old grist mill tavern and hemenway’s seafood grille  oyster bar restaurants restaurants are visited regularly by all levels of supervision to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards 

each concept’s head of training together with senior operations executives are responsible for developing and maintaining that concept’s operations training programs these efforts include a 12 to 15week training program for management trainees and continuing development programs for managers supervisors and directors this program has now been expanded to include both longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille personnel as part of the integration of rare the emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant concept but includes leadership restaurant business management and culinary skills we also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants including deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations the opening training teams typically begin work one week prior to opening and remain at the new restaurant for up to three weeks after the opening they are redeployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant’s operating staff 

we maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our managementlevel employees we believe that our leadership position strong successoriented culture and various shortterm and longterm incentive programs including stock units help attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers with 

  

the acquisition of rare we also have continued a managing partner program in which qualifying general managers of longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille restaurants receive cash compensation and restricted stock awards based upon individual performance 

quality assurance 

our total quality department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe highquality food in a clean and safe environment through rigorous physical evaluation and testing at our north american laboratories and through “point source inspection” by our international team of quality specialists in several foreign countries we purchase only seafood that meets or exceeds our specifications we use independent third parties to inspect and evaluate commodity vendors in addition any commodity supplier that produces a “high risk” product is subject to a food safety evaluation by darden personnel at least annually we require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive hazard analysis and critical control point “haccp” food safety programs adopted by the us food and drug administration the haccp programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause foodborne illnesses by applying scientificallybased controls to analyze hazards identify and monitor critical control points and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met since 1976 we have required routine microbiological testing of seafood and other commodities for quality and microbiological safety in addition our total quality managers and third party auditors visit each restaurant periodically throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation the total quality managers also serve as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety this haccp program has now been expanded to include both longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille operations as part of the integration of rare 

purchasing and distribution 

our ability to ensure a consistent supply of highquality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant concepts depends on reliable sources of procurement our purchasing staff sources negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 2000 suppliers in more than 30 countries suppliers must meet strict quality control standards in the development harvest catch and production of food products competitive bids longterm contracts and longterm vendor relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products 

we believe that our seafood purchasing capabilities are a significant competitive advantage our purchasing staff travels routinely within the united states and internationally to source more than 100 varieties of topquality seafood at competitive prices we believe that we have established excellent longterm relationships with key seafood vendors and usually source our product directly from producers not brokers or middlemen we operate procurement offices in singapore and toronto our only purchasing offices outside of orlando to source products directly from asia and canada while the supply of certain seafood species is volatile we believe we have the ability to identify alternative seafood products and to adjust our menus as necessary all other essential food products are available or can be made available upon short notice from alternative qualified suppliers because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales controlled inventories of specified products are distributed to restaurants through independent national distribution companies in addition through strategic alliances between darden direct distribution inc and these distribution companies we maintain inventory ownership and dedicated operations in select environments enhancing our supply chain’s competitive advantage 

our supplier diversity program is an integral part of our purchasing efforts through this program we identify minority and womenowned vendors and assist them in establishing supplier relationships with us we are committed to the development and growth of minority and womenowned enterprises and in fiscal 2008 we spent approximately 9 percent and 3 percent respectively of our purchasing dollars with those firms 

we continue to invest in new technologies to improve our purchasing and restaurant operations we are in the process of expanding “ikitchen” a webbased software system to our regional suppliers the system is designed to more efficiently handle restaurant product orders receiving invoice approval and inventories 

  

advertising and marketing 

we believe we have developed significant marketing and advertising capabilities our size enables us to be a leading advertiser in the full service dining segment of the restaurant industry red lobster and olive garden leverage the efficiency of national network television advertising and supplement it with local television advertising longhorn steakhouse the capital grille bahama breeze and seasons 52 do not use national television advertising our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to attract customers we implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase our sales and profits we also rely on outdoor billboard and direct mail advertising as well as radio newspaper and direct mail coupon programs as appropriate to attract customers we have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor customer satisfaction and evolving expectations 

employees 

at the end of fiscal 2008 we employed approximately 179000 persons of these employees approximately 1550 were corporate or restaurant concept personnel located in our restaurant support center in orlando florida approximately 50 were corporate personnel located in atlanta georgia approximately 8000 were restaurant management personnel in the restaurants or in field offices and the remainder were hourly restaurant personnel of the corporate and restaurant concept personnel located at our restaurant support center in orlando and atlanta approximately 65 percent were management personnel and the balance were administrative or office employees our operating executives have an average of more than 11 years of experience with us the restaurant general managers average nine years with us we believe that we provide working conditions and compensation that compare favorably with those of our competitors most employees other than restaurant management and corporate management are paid on an hourly basis none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our employee relations to be good 

information technology 

we strive for leadership in the restaurant business by using technology as a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy since 1975 computers located in the restaurants have been used to assist in the management of the restaurants we have implemented systems targeted at improved financial control cost management enhanced guest service and improved employee effectiveness management information systems are designed to be used across restaurant concepts yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant concept several years ago we implemented a suite of webenabled and fully integrated financial and human resource including payroll and benefits systems we also implemented a highspeed data network connecting all restaurants to all current and anticipated future applications during the past year we completed the implementation of “dash” a next generation technology platform for our restaurant point of sale system in olive garden red lobster bahama breeze and seasons 52 restaurants we expect to deploy the new platform including new hardware and software to all longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille restaurants over the next year in the past year we completed the implementation of a meal pacing system in olive garden and red lobster the new meal pacing system is designed to properly pace the preparation of menu items based on cooktimes to enhance the guest’s experience and enhance restaurant capacity by increasing table turns we are also in the process of expanding “ikitchen” a webbased software system designed to more efficiently handle restaurant product orders and other related matters to regional suppliers as discussed above under “purchasing and distribution” 

in the past year we began integrating the longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille restaurant businesses into the company’s core business processes and applications we completed the integration and implementation effort for the financial systems and began to deploy several other key applications including human resources systems “ikitchen” and “par pull” a webbased software system designed to more efficiently handle food and menu item preparation we expect to have our human resource applications and “ikitchen” fully deployed in fiscal 2009 in all longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille restaurants and “par pull” fully deployed in fiscal 2009 in all longhorn steakhouse restaurants 

restaurant hardware and software support for all of our restaurant concepts including the newly integrated longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille concepts is provided or coordinated from the restaurant support center in orlando florida seven days a week 24 hours a day a communications network sends and receives critical business data to and from the restaurants throughout the day and night providing timely and extensive information 

  

on business activity in every location the restaurant support center houses our data center which contains sufficient computing power to process information from all restaurants quickly and efficiently our information is processed in a secure environment to protect both the actual data and the physical assets we guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan which includes storing critical business information offsite testing the disaster recovery plan at a hostsite facility and providing onsite power backup via a large diesel generator we use internally developed proprietary software as well as purchased software with proven nonproprietary hardware this allows processing power to be distributed effectively to each of our restaurants 

our management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates will position us well to support current needs and future growth we are committed to maintaining an industry leadership position in information systems and computing technology we use a strategic information systems planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic financial regulatory and other business advantage criteria 

competition 

the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food price service restaurant location personnel concept attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing the restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing restaurants and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power we compete within each market with national and regional chains and locallyowned restaurants for customers management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites we also face growing competition from the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section we expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas 

other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled “purchasing and distribution” “advertising and marketing” and “information technology” and in our risk factors in item 1a of this form 10k

the full service dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing service location personnel and type and quality of food and there are many wellestablished competitors we compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locallyowned restaurants we also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services particularly in the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from 

  

the deli section we compete primarily on the quality variety and value perception of menu items the number and location of restaurants type of concept quality and efficiency of service attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors we anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors if we are unable to continue to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and certain general economic factors including energy prices and interest rates that are largely out of our control may adversely affect our results of operations 

our business results depend on a number of industryspecific and general economic factors many of which are beyond our control the full service dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in national regional and local economic conditions seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant concepts and health concerns for example health concerns relating to the consumption of beef or to specific events such as the outbreak of “mad cow disease” may adversely impact sales at longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille restaurants that offer beef as a primary menu item in addition public concern over “avian flu” may cause fear about the consumption of chicken eggs and other products derived from poultry the inability to serve beef or poultrybased products would restrict our ability to provide a variety of menu items to our guests if we change a restaurant concept or menu in response to such concerns we may lose customers who do not prefer the new concept or menu and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new customer base to produce the revenue needed to make the restaurant profitable we also may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of such a concept change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors the performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends severe weather including hurricanes traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants 

general economic conditions may also adversely affect our results of operations recessionary economic cycles a protracted economic slowdown a worsening economy increased energy prices rising interest rates or other industrywide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings when gasoline natural gas electricity and other energy costs increase and credit card home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine out or may choose more inexpensive restaurants when eating outside the home furthermore we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts terrorist attacks efforts to combat terrorism heightened security requirements or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems could have on our operations the economy or consumer confidence generally any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures 

unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our customers could increase our costs reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the price and availability of food ingredients and utilities used by our restaurants could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food ingredients utilities and other related costs over which we may have little control operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities including shrimp lobster crab and other seafood as well as beef pork chicken cheese and produce the introduction of or changes to tariffs on imported shrimp or other food products could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products we are subject to the general risks of inflation our restaurants’ operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as electricity and natural gas whether as a result of inflation or otherwise on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

we may lose revenue or incur increased costs if our restaurants experience shortages or interruptions in the delivery of food and other supplies 

possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants caused by inclement weather natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes the inability of our vendors to obtain credit in a tightened credit market or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants our inability to effectively manage supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our restaurant operations if we temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular items from a restaurant’s menu that restaurant may experience a significant reduction in revenue during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our customers changing their dining habits 

we may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs 

our restaurant operations are subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages working conditions overtime and tip credits as federal and state minimum wage rates increase we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage labor shortages and increased employee turnover could also increase our labor costs if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices our profitability may decline in addition the current premiums that we pay for our insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property health and directors’ and officers’ liability may increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs the dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers’ compensation and general liability insurance for which we carry high perclaim deductibles may also increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs further the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses 

the loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

our future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other employees our future growth also depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage our restaurants we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our projected growth a loss of key employees or a significant shortage of high quality restaurant employees could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets 

we rely heavily on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or breach of security of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

we rely heavily on information systems across our operations including for management of our supply chain pointofsale processing in our restaurants and various other processes and transactions our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to updgraded or replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations and significant capital investments could be required to remediate the problem 

increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

if our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions if our advertising media or marketing expenses increase or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than that of our competitors we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may experience higherthananticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our revenues and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants we incur substantial preopening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close relocate or remodel existing 

  

restaurants the expenses of opening closing relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated an increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees consumers suppliers shareholders or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time the cost to defend future litigation may be significant there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of our services regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable as a result litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable publicity could harm our business 

multiunit restaurant businesses such as ours can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from complaints or litigation or general publicity regarding poor food quality foodborne illness personal injury food tampering adverse health effects of consumption of various food products or highcalorie foods including obesity or other concerns negative publicity may also result from actual or alleged violations by our restaurants of “dram shop” laws which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or to a third party regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants or only to a single restaurant could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of food safety or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

the success of our restaurants depends in large part on their location as demographic and economic patterns change current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced revenues in those locations in addition desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation the occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

we are subject to a number of risks relating to federal state and local regulation of our business that may increase our costs and decrease our profit margins 

the restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including those relating to building and zoning requirements and those relating to the preparation and sale of food the development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites which are subject to zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations and requirements we are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health sanitation safety and fire standards and liquor licenses federal and state laws governing our relationships with employees including the fair labor standards act of 1938 the immigration reform and control act of 1986 and applicable requirements concerning the minimum wage overtime family leave tip credits working conditions safety standards and immigration status federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities such as the americans with disabilities act of 1990 in addition we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge emission and disposal of hazardous materials the impact of current laws and regulations the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal state and local authorities could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability we also face risks from 

  

new and changing laws and regulations relating to nutritional content nutritional labeling product safety and menu labeling compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings 

our growth through the opening of new restaurants and the development or acquisition of new dining concepts may not be successful and could result in poor financial performance 

as part of our business strategy we intend to continue to expand our current portfolio of restaurant concepts and to develop or acquire additional concepts that can be expanded profitably this strategy involves numerous risks and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives we may not be able to open all of our planned new restaurants and the new restaurants that we open may not be profitable or as profitable as our existing restaurants new restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize and even sales at successful newlyopened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation the opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on sales levels at existing restaurants furthermore we may not be able to develop or acquire additional concepts that are as profitable as our existing restaurants growth through acquisitions may involve additional risks for example we may pay too much for a concept relative to the actual economic return be required to borrow funds to make our acquisition which would increase our interest expense or be unable to integrate an acquired concept into our operations 

the ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations the need to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses on a timely basis the need to comply with other regulatory requirements the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay construction increases in labor and building material costs the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms changes in weather or other acts of god that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions at each potential location we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites construction contractors management personnel hourly employees and other resources if we are unable to successfully manage these risks we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues and earnings in future periods 

our plans to expand our newer concepts bahama breeze and seasons 52 that have not yet proven their longterm viability may not be successful which could require us to make substantial further investments in those concepts and result in losses and impairments 

while each of our restaurant concepts as well as each of our individual restaurants are subject to the risks and uncertainties described above there is an enhanced level of risk and uncertainty related to the operation and expansion of our newer concepts such as bahama breeze and seasons 52 these concepts have not yet proven their longterm viability or growth potential we have made substantial investments in the development and expansion of each of these concepts and further investment is required while we have implemented a number of changes to operations at bahama breeze and believe we have improved the guest experience and unit economics sufficiently to restart modest unit growth in fiscal 2009 there can be no assurance that these changes will continue to be successful or that new unit growth will occur seasons 52 also is in the very early stages of its development and will require additional resources to support further growth in each case these brands will continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties that accompany any emerging restaurant concept 

failure to combine and integrate the business of rare into our operations in a successful and timely manner could adversely affect our business 

we closed the acquisition of rare on october 1 2007 our integration of rare’s business into our operations is a complex and timeconsuming process which will require significant efforts and expenses prior to the merger the two companies operated independently each with its own business customers employees culture and systems we may experience material unanticipated difficulties or expenses in connection with the integration of the business of rare the difficulties of combining the business of rare with our operations may include among others 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

 many of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if we successfully integrate the business of rare into our operations we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the rare acquisition 

even if we successfully integrate the business of rare into our operations there can be no assurance that the acquisition will result in the realization of the anticipated benefits we acquired rare with the expectation that the acquisition will result in various benefits for the combined company including among others business and growth opportunities and significant synergies from increased efficiency and effectiveness in purchasing distribution and other restaurant and corporate support however we may not be able to realize the synergies goodwill business opportunities and growth prospects anticipated in connection with the acquisition we may experience increased competition that limits our ability to expand our business we may not be able to capitalize on expected business opportunities or general industry and business conditions may deteriorate achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors if these factors limit our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition our expectations of future results of operations including the synergies expected to result from the acquisition may not be met if such difficulties are encountered or if such synergies business opportunities and growth prospects are not realized our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we incurred substantial additional indebtedness to finance the rare acquisition which may decrease our business flexibility and increase our borrowing costs 

our consolidated indebtedness following the rare acquisition is substantially greater than our indebtedness prior to the acquisition the increased indebtedness and higher debttoequity ratio of our company as compared to that which existed on a historical basis will have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs 

our level of indebtedness could have important consequences for example it may 

 

  

  

 there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity a default under our debt instruments may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing 

  

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

failure of our internal controls over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud our growth and acquisition of other restaurant companies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud a significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock

 of these 1702 restaurants open on may 25 2008 904 were located on owned sites and 798 were located on leased sites the 798 leases are classified as follows 

 

 properties – general 

during fiscal 1999 we formed two subsidiary corporations each of which elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust “reit” under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code these elections limit the activities of both corporations to holding certain real estate assets the formation of these two reits is designed primarily to assist us in managing our real estate portfolio and possibly to provide a vehicle to access capital markets in the future 

  

both reits are nonpublic reits through our subsidiary companies we indirectly own 100 percent of all voting stock and greater than 995 percent of the total value of each reit for financial reporting purposes both reits are included in our consolidated financial statements 

all of the buildings that make up our executive offices culinary center training facilities and supporting warehouses in orange county orlando metro area florida are currently leased on june 20 2006 we entered into an agreement to sell and lease back the 10 buildings that we previously owned the sale and the commencement of our leases for those buildings occurred in august 2006 the initial term of the leases is three years and we have two oneyear renewal options 

we purchased several adjacent parcels of vacant land in orange county florida and plan to relocate our headquarters to this site construction of the buildings on this site is underway we expect our proposed restaurant support center campus at this new location to offer a more collaborative and unified environment with additional room for future growth we currently project completing the first phase of this development during fiscal 2010 

as part of the acquisition of rare we acquired ownership of the former rare executive offices and central training facility located in 6 office buildings in atlanta georgia we recently completed the sale of one of those buildings the remaining buildings are currently being marketed for sale 

except in limited instances our present restaurant sites and other facilities are not subject to mortgages or encumbrances securing money borrowed by us from outside sources in our opinion our current buildings and equipment generally are in good condition suitable for their purposes and adequate for our current needs see also note 6 “land buildings and equipment net” and note 14 “leases” under notes to consolidated financial statements in our 2008 annual report to shareholders incorporated herein by reference

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend we are subject to private lawsuits administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business a number of these lawsuits proceedings and claims may exist at any given time these matters typically involve claims from guests employees and others related to operational issues common to the restaurant industry and can also involve infringement of or challenges to our trademarks while the resolution of a lawsuit proceeding or claim may have an impact on our financial results for the period in which it is resolved we believe that the final disposition of the lawsuits proceedings and claims in which we are currently involved either individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity the following is a brief description of the more significant of these matters in view of the inherent uncertainties of litigation the outcome of any unresolved matter described below cannot be predicted at this time nor can the amount of any potential loss be reasonably estimated 

like other restaurant companies and retail employers in a few states we have been faced with allegations of purported classwide wage and hour violations in january 2004 a former food server filed a purported class action in california state court alleging that red lobster’s “server banking” policies and practices under which servers settle guest checks directly with customers throughout their shifts and turn in collected monies at the shift’s end improperly required her and other food servers and bartenders to make up cash shortages and walkouts in violation of california law the case was ordered to arbitration as a procedural matter the arbitrator ruled that classwide arbitration is permissible under our dispute resolution program in january 2007 plaintiffs’ counsel filed in california state court a second purported class action lawsuit on behalf of servers and bartenders alleging that olive garden’s server banking policy and its alleged failure to pay split shift premiums violated california law although we believed that our policies and practices were lawful and that we had strong defenses to both cases following mediation with the plaintiffs we reached a tentative resolution of the matters during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 as a result we accrued approximately 40 million in legal settlement costs during the nine months ended february 24 2008 which we expect to be paid in fiscal 2009 no additional reserves have been taken in connection with this settlement 

in august 2007 an action was filed in california state court by a former olive garden server alleging that olive garden’s scheduling practices resulted in failure to properly pay reporting time minimum shift pay as well as to pay minimum wage to provide itemized wage statements and to timely pay employees upon the termination of 

  

their employment the complaint sought to have the suit certified as a class action although we believed that our policies and practices were lawful and we had strong defenses following mediation with the plaintiffs we reached a preliminary settlement of this matter during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 under which we agreed to pay 07 million we anticipate that the preliminary settlement amount will be paid out during fiscal 2009 at the completion of the settlement process 

on march 13 2008 a purported class action complaint alleging violation of the federal securities laws was filed by an institutional shareholder against darden and certain of our current officers one of whom is also a director in the united states district court for the middle district of florida the complaint was filed on behalf of all purchasers of darden’s common stock between june 19 2007 and december 18 2007 the “class” the complaint alleges that during that period the defendants issued false and misleading statements in press releases and public filings that misrepresented and failed to disclose certain information and that as a result had no reasonable basis for statements about darden’s prospects and guidance for fiscal 2008 the complaint alleges claims under sections 10b and 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 and rule 10b5 thereunder the plaintiff seeks to recover unspecified damages on behalf of the class we intend to vigorously defend our position in this action 

by letter dated may 9 2008 a putative shareholder demanded that our board of directors take action to remedy alleged breaches of fiduciary duty to the company by certain officers and directors the letter contains similar allegations to those in the purported class action described above regarding the alleged issuance of false and misleading statements and omissions regarding darden’s financial results and sales growth the board has formed a special litigation committee to evaluate the claims in the letter

  strategy 

the restaurant industry is generally considered to be comprised of four segments quick service midscale casual dining and fine dining the industry is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains we believe that capable operators of strong multiunit concepts have the opportunity to increase their share of the casual dining segment we plan to grow by increasing the number of restaurants in each of our existing concepts other than smokey bones and by developing or acquiring additional concepts that can be expanded profitably we have announced our intention to exit the smokey bones business see “restaurant concepts – discontinued operations – smokey bones” 

while we are a leader in the casual dining segment we know we cannot be successful without a clear sense of who we are our core purpose is “to nourish and delight everyone we serve” this core purpose is supported by our core values 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our mission is to be “the best in casual dining now and for generations” we believe we can achieve this goal by continuing to build on our strategy to be a multibrand casual dining growth company which is grounded in our commitment to combining the following four strategic pillar areas 

 

  

  

  

 our strategic framework also includes two points that we believe separate us from our competition we are committed to 

 

  

   

restaurant concepts – continuing operations 

red lobster 

red lobster is the largest casual dining seafoodspecialty restaurant operator in the united states it offers an extensive menu featuring fresh fish shrimp crab lobster scallops and other seafood in a casual atmosphere the menu includes a variety of specialty seafood and nonseafood entrées appetizers and desserts 

most dinner menu entrée prices range from 950 to 3350 with certain lobster items available by the pound and seasonalregional fresh fish selections available on a daily fresh fish menu most lunch menu entrée prices range from 599 to 1350 the price of most entrées includes salad side items and our signature cheddar bay biscuits during fiscal 2007 the average check per person ranged from 1750 to 1850 with alcoholic beverages accounting for approximately 78 percent of red lobster’s sales red lobster maintains approximately 68 different menus across its trade areas to reflect geographic differences in consumer preferences prices and selections as well as a lowerpriced children’s menu 

olive garden 

olive garden is the market share leader among casual dining italian restaurants in the united states olive garden’s menu includes a variety of authentic italian foods featuring fresh ingredients and a wine list that includes a broad selection of wines imported from italy the menu includes antipasti appetizers soups salad and garlic breadsticks baked pastas sautéed specialties with chicken seafood and fresh vegetables grilled meats and a variety of desserts olive garden also uses coffee imported from italy for its espresso and cappuccino olive garden is accelerating new restaurant growth and has introduced two new prototypes that are delivering the same guest experience while reducing capital investment and improving operating efficiencies 

most dinner menu entrée prices range from 850 to 1995 and most lunch menu entrée prices range from 595 to 1025 the price of each entrée also includes as much fresh salad or soup and breadsticks as a guest desires during fiscal 2007 the average check per person ranged from 1450 to 1550 with alcoholic beverages accounting for approximately 81 percent of olive garden’s sales olive garden maintains approximately 35 different dinner menus and 28 lunch menus across its trade areas to reflect geographic differences in consumer preferences prices and selections as well as nine children’s menus 

bahama breeze 

bahama breeze restaurants bring guests the feeling of a caribbean escape offering food drinks and atmosphere you would find in the islands the menu features distinctive caribbeaninspired fresh seafood chicken and steaks as well as signature specialty drinks the first bahama breeze opened in 1996 and met with strong positive consumer response we continued to test the concept by opening a limited number of additional restaurants in each of the following years and began national expansion of the concept in 1998 while the concept continued to be well received by guests its financial performance did not meet our overall expectations and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 bahama breeze closed six restaurants and wrote down the carrying value of four others this action reduced the total number of restaurants in operation to 32 and all new restaurant expansion was postponed 

since fiscal 2004 bahama breeze has implemented changes to become a more relevant brand for its guests evolving its menu to make it more approachable yet still distinctive and improving the guest experience while lowering its operating costs bahama breeze will continue to seek to achieve its strong potential by elevating the guest experience to be competitively superior and by improving restaurantlevel returns through changes to its operations that remove costs and complexity that do not add value for its guests in fiscal 2007 bahama breeze wrote down the carrying value of five restaurants and closed nine but improved the guest experience and unit economics sufficiently at the remaining restaurants that we now expect to restart modest unit growth in fiscal 2009 the results of operations of these nine closed restaurants are reported as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

most dinner menu entrée prices at bahama breeze range from 900 to 2200 and most lunch entrée prices range from 700 to 1400 during fiscal 2007 the average check per person ranged from 2200 to 2300 

  

with alcoholic beverages accounting for approximately 238 percent of bahama breeze’s sales bahama breeze maintains 11 different lunch and dinner menus to reflect geographic differences in consumer preferences prices and selections as well as two children’s menus 

seasons 52 

seasons 52 is a casually sophisticated fresh grill and wine bar with seasonally inspired menus offering fresh ingredients to create great tasting meals that are lower in calories than comparable restaurant meals it offers an international wine list of more than 140 wines with 70 available by the glass the first seasons 52 opened in 2003 and we continued to test the concept by opening a limited number of additional restaurants in each of the following years seasons 52 plans to continue operating its seven existing restaurants and open approximately two new restaurants in fiscal 2009 

restaurant concepts – discontinued operations 

smokey bones 

smokey bones features barbequed pork beef and chicken as well as other grilled favorites all served in a lively yet comfortable mountainlodge setting that features televised sports we opened the first smokey bones in september 1999 and began national expansion of the concept in fiscal 2002 softening of sales at smokey bones led us to reevaluate our new restaurant opening strategy and test a new direction for the business in fiscal 2007 we opened a new repositioned smokey bones restaurant named rocky river grillhouse and a second rocky river grillhouse from a converted smokey bones however the smokey bones concept and related business model was designed to be a nationally advertised brand and since it was not on a path to achieving that vision we concluded it was not a meaningful growth vehicle for darden therefore on may 5 2007 we announced the closure of 54 smokey bones and both rocky river grillhouse restaurants indicated our intention to operate the remaining 73 smokey bones restaurants while seeking a buyer and incurred noncash impairment charges and other costs relating to these actions the results of operations for these restaurants are treated as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

recent and planned growth – continuing operations 

during fiscal 2007 as discussed above we closed nine bahama breeze 54 smokey bones and two rocky river grillhouse restaurants that are treated as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements on a continuing operations basis during fiscal 2007 we opened 38 new restaurants excluding the relocation of existing restaurants to new sites and the rebuilding of restaurants at existing sites and permanently closed 7 restaurants in addition we had one restaurant closed temporarily at the end of fiscal 2007 which we expect to reopen during fiscal 2008 including the fiscal 2007 reopening of two rebuilt restaurants closed in fiscal 2006 we had a net increase of 32 restaurants in fiscal 2007 or a net decrease of 34 restaurants in fiscal 2007 including discontinued operations we plan to open approximately 4148 new red lobster and olive garden restaurants during fiscal 2008 excluding relocations and rebuilds our actual and projected new openings from continuing operations by concept excluding relocations and rebuilds are shown below 

 

 the actual number of openings for each of our concepts will depend on many factors including our ability to locate appropriate sites negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms obtain necessary local governmental permits complete construction and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel our objective is to continue to expand red lobster olive garden bahama breeze and seasons 52 and to develop or acquire additional concepts that can be expanded profitably we have continued to test new ideas and concepts and also to evaluate potential acquisition candidates to assess whether they would satisfy our strategic and financial objectives 

  

we consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant’s longterm success and we devote significant effort to the site selection process prior to entering a market we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors these factors include trade area demographics such as target population density and household income levels competitive influences in the trade area the site’s visibility accessibility and traffic volume and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls hotelmotel complexes offices and universities members of senior management evaluate inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after permits are obtained and the site is acquired 

the following table illustrates the approximate average capital investment size and dining capacity of the four red lobster restaurants opened during fiscal 2007 consisting of three new restaurants and one relocation and the 32 olive garden restaurants that were opened during fiscal 2007 excluding one inline restaurant opened in fiscal 2007 

 

     we systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards when a restaurant falls below minimum standards we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes and implement marketing and operational plans to improve that restaurant’s performance if performance does not improve to acceptable levels the restaurant is evaluated for relocation closing or conversion to one of our other concepts 

during fiscal 2007 in addition to the actions taken with respect to smokey bones and rocky river grillhouse in may 2007 discussed above we permanently closed five and relocated one red lobster restaurant permanently closed two olive garden restaurants and permanently closed nine bahama breeze restaurants 

restaurant operations 

we believe that highquality restaurant management is critical to our longterm success we also believe that our leadership position strong successoriented culture and various shortterm and longterm incentive programs including stock units help attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers 

our restaurant management structure varies by concept and restaurant size each restaurant is led by a general manager and three to five additional managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant each restaurant also employs approximately 50185 hourly employees most of whom work parttime we issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards at our two largest concepts red lobster and olive garden restaurant general managers report to directors at red lobster and olive garden each director was responsible for six to 10 restaurants at the end of fiscal 2007 which is our target range for each director at established concepts restaurants are visited regularly by all levels of supervision to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards 

  

each concept’s vice president or director of training together with senior operations executives are responsible for developing and maintaining that concept’s operations training programs these efforts include a 12 to 15week training program for management trainees and continuing development programs for managers supervisors and directors the emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant concept but includes leadership restaurant business management and culinary skills we also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants including deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations the opening training teams typically begin work one week prior to opening and remain at the new restaurant up to three weeks after the opening they are redeployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant’s operating staff 

quality assurance 

our total quality department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe highquality food in a clean and safe environment through rigorous physical evaluation and testing at our north american laboratories and through “point source inspection” by our international team of quality specialists in several foreign countries we purchase only seafood that meets or exceeds our specifications we use independent third parties to inspect and evaluate commodity vendors in addition any commodity supplier that produces a “high risk” product is subject to a food safety evaluation by darden personnel at least annually we require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive hazard analysis and critical control point haccp food safety programs adopted by the us food and drug administration in place the haccp programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause foodborne illnesses by applying scientificallybased controls to analyze hazards identify and monitor critical control points and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met since 1976 we have required routine microbiological testing of seafood and other commodities for quality and microbiological safety in addition our total quality managers and third party auditors visit each restaurant periodically throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation the total quality managers also serve as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety 

purchasing and distribution 

our ability to ensure a consistent supply of highquality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant concepts depends on reliable sources of procurement from reliable sources our purchasing staff sources negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 2000 suppliers in more than 30 countries suppliers must meet strict quality control standards in the development harvest catch and production of food products competitive bids longterm contracts and longterm vendor relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products 

we believe that our seafood purchasing capabilities are a significant competitive advantage our purchasing staff travels routinely within the united states and internationally to source more than 100 varieties of topquality seafood at competitive prices we believe that we have established excellent longterm relationships with key seafood vendors and usually source our product directly from producers not brokers or middlemen we operate procurement offices in singapore and toronto our only purchasing offices outside of orlando to source products directly from asia and canada while the supply of certain seafood species is volatile we believe we have the ability to identify alternative seafood products and to adjust our menus as necessary all other essential food products are available or can be made available upon short notice from alternative qualified suppliers because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales controlled inventories of specified products are distributed to restaurants through independent national distribution companies in addition through strategic alliances between darden direct distribution inc and these distribution companies we maintain inventory ownership and operations dedication in select environments enhancing our supply chain’s competitive advantage 

our supplier diversity program is an integral part of our purchasing efforts through this program we identify minority and womenowned vendors and assist them in establishing supplier relationships with us we are committed to the development and growth of minority and womenowned enterprises and in fiscal 2007 we spent approximately 84 percent and 31 percent respectively of our purchasing dollars with those firms 

  

we continue to invest in new technologies to improve our purchasing and restaurant operations we are in the process of implementing “ikitchen” a webbased software system at all of our restaurants the system is designed to more efficiently handle restaurant product orders receiving invoice approval and inventories 

advertising and marketing 

we believe we have developed significant marketing and advertising capabilities our size enables us to be a leading advertiser in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry red lobster and olive garden leverage the efficiency of national network television advertising and supplement it with local television advertising bahama breeze and smokey bones do not use national television advertising our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to attract customers we implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase our sales and profits we also rely on outdoor billboard and direct mail advertising as well as radio newspaper and direct mail coupon programs as appropriate to attract customers we have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor customer satisfaction and evolving expectations 

employees 

at the end of fiscal 2007 we employed approximately 157000 persons of these employees approximately 1300 were corporate or restaurant concept personnel located in our restaurant support center in orlando florida approximately 6300 were restaurant management personnel in the restaurants or in field offices and the remainder were hourly restaurant personnel of the restaurant support center employees approximately 60 percent were management personnel and the balance were administrative or office employees our operating executives have an average of more than 14 years of experience with us the restaurant general managers average 12 years with us we believe that we provide working conditions and compensation that compare favorably with those of our competitors most employees other than restaurant management and corporate management are paid on an hourly basis none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our employee relations to be good 

information technology 

we strive for leadership in the restaurant business by using technology as a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy since 1975 computers located in the restaurants have been used to assist in the management of the restaurants we have implemented systems targeted at improved financial control cost management enhanced guest service and improved employee effectiveness management information systems are designed to be used across restaurant concepts yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant concept several years ago we implemented a suite of webenabled and fully integrated financial and human resource including payroll and benefits systems we also implemented a highspeed data network connecting all restaurants to all current and anticipated future applications in the past year we continued the implementation of “dash” a next generation technology platform for our restaurant point of sale system we expect to deploy the new platform including new hardware and software to all restaurant concepts over the next year in the past year we piloted and began deploying a meal pacing system in olive garden and red lobster the new meal pacing system is designed to properly pace the preparation of menu items based on cooktimes to enhance the guest’s experience and enhance restaurant capacity by increasing table turns we anticipate that this system will be fully deployed in olive garden and red lobster by the end of fiscal 2008 we are also in the process of implementing “ikitchen” a webbased software system designed to more efficiently handle restaurant product orders and other related matters as discussed above under “purchasing and distribution” 

restaurant hardware and software support is provided or coordinated from the restaurant support center in orlando florida seven days a week 24 hours a day a communications network sends and receives critical business data to and from the restaurants throughout the day and night providing timely and extensive information on business activity in every location the restaurant support center houses our data center which contains sufficient computing power to process information from all restaurants quickly and efficiently our information is processed in a secure environment to protect both the actual data and the physical assets we guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan which includes storing critical business information offsite testing the disaster recovery plan at a hostsite facility and providing onsite power backup via a large diesel generator we use internally developed proprietary software as well as purchased software with proven nonproprietary hardware this allows processing power to be distributed effectively to each of our restaurants 

  

our management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates will position us well to support current needs and future growth we are committed to maintaining an industry leadership position in information systems and computing technology we use a strategic information systems planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic financial regulatory and other business advantage criteria 

competition 

the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food price service restaurant location personnel concept attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing the restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing restaurants and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power we compete within each market with national and regional chains and locallyowned restaurants for customers management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites we also face growing competition from the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section we expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas 

other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled “purchasing and distribution” “advertising and marketing” “information technology” and “risk factors” elsewhere in this report

government regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws affecting our business each of our restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities which include health safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located the development and operation of restaurants depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites which are subject to zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations to date we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals 

during fiscal 2007 approximately 87 percent of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site in most cases on an annual basis and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time these regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant 

  

operation including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours of operation advertising wholesale purchasing inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages the failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these licenses would adversely affect the restaurant’s operations we also are subject in certain states to “dramshop” statutes which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person who then causes injury to himself or a third party we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance

 item 1a risk factors tableend various risks and uncertainties could affect our business any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations therefore the following is not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to continue to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

the casual dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing service location personnel and type and quality of food and there are many wellestablished competitors we compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locallyowned restaurants we also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services particularly in the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section we compete primarily on the quality variety and value perception of menu items the number and location of restaurants type of concept quality and efficiency of service attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors we anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors if we are unable to continue to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and certain general economic factors including energy prices and interest rates that are largely out of our control may adversely affect our results of operations 

our business results depend on a number of industryspecific and general economic factors many of which are beyond our control the casual dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in national regional and local economic conditions seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes consumer preferences including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant concepts and consumer spending patterns the performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends severe weather including hurricanes traffic patterns and the type number and location of competing restaurants 

  

in addition general economic conditions may adversely affect our results of operations recessionary economic cycles a protracted economic slowdown a worsening economy increased energy prices rising interest rates or other industrywide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings when gasoline natural gas electricity and other energy costs increase and credit card home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine out or may choose more inexpensive restaurants when eating outside the home furthermore we cannot predict the effects of actual or threatened armed conflicts or terrorist attacks efforts to combat terrorism military action against any foreign state or group located in a foreign state or heightened security requirements on the economy or consumer confidence in the united states any of these events could also affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures 

unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our customers could increase our costs reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the price and availability of food ingredients and utilities used by our restaurants could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food ingredients utilities and other related costs over which we may have little control operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities including shrimp lobster crab and other seafood as well as beef pork chicken cheese and produce the introduction of or changes to tariffs on imported shrimp or other food products could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products we are subject to the general risks of inflation in addition possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items caused by inclement weather or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of the items we buy our restaurants’ operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as electricity and natural gas whether as a result of inflation or otherwise on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs 

our restaurant operations are subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages working conditions overtime and tip credits as federal and state minimum wage rates increase we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage labor shortages and increased employee turnover could also increase our labor costs if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices our profitability may decline in addition the current premiums that we pay for our insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property health and directors’ and officers’ liability may increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs the dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers’ compensation and general liability insurance for which we carry high perclaim deductibles may also increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs further the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses 

increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

if our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions if our advertising media or marketing expenses increase or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than that of our competitors we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may experience higherthananticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our revenues and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants we incur substantial preopening 

  

expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close relocate or remodel existing restaurants the expenses of opening closing relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated an increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees consumers suppliers shareholders or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time the cost to defend future litigation may be significant there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of our services regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable as a result litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable publicity could harm our business 

multiunit restaurant businesses such as ours can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from complaints or litigation alleging poor food quality foodborne illness personal injury adverse health effects including obesity or other concerns negative publicity may also result from actual or alleged violations by our restaurants of “dram shop” laws which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or to a third party regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants or only to a single restaurant could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of food safety could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

the success of our restaurants depends in large part on their location as demographic and economic patterns change current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced revenues in those locations in addition desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation the occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

we are subject to a number of risks relating to federal state and local regulation of our business that may increase our costs and decrease our profit margins 

the restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including those relating to building and zoning requirements and those relating to the preparation and sale of food the development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites which are subject to zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations and requirements we are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health sanitation safety and fire standards and liquor licenses federal and state laws governing our relationships with employees including the fair labor standards act of 1938 and the immigration reform and control act of 1986 and applicable requirements concerning the minimum wage overtime family leave tip credits working conditions safety standards and immigration status federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities such as the americans with disabilities act of 1990 in addition we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge emission and disposal of hazardous materials the impact of current laws and regulations the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal state and local authorities could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability 

  

our growth through the opening of new restaurants and the development or acquisition of new dining concepts may not be successful and could result in poor financial performance 

as part of our business strategy we intend to continue to expand our current portfolio of restaurant concepts and to develop or acquire additional concepts that can be expanded profitably this strategy involves numerous risks and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives we may not be able to open all of our planned new restaurants and the new restaurants that we open may not be profitable or as profitable as our existing restaurants new restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize and even sales at successful newlyopened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation the opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on sales levels at existing restaurants furthermore we may not be able to develop or acquire additional concepts that are as profitable as our existing restaurants growth through acquisitions may involve additional risks for example we may pay too much for a concept relative to the actual economic return be required to borrow funds to make our acquisition which would increase our interest expense or be unable to integrate an acquired concept into our operations 

the ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations the need to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses on a timely basis the need to comply with other regulatory requirements the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay construction increases in labor and building material costs the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms changes in weather or other acts of god that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions at each potential location we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites construction contractors management personnel hourly employees and other resources if we are unable to successfully manage these risks we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues and earnings in future periods 

our plans to expand our newer concepts bahama breeze and seasons 52 that have not yet proven their longterm viability may not be successful which could require us to make substantial further investments in those concepts and result in further losses and impairments 

while each of our restaurant concepts as well as each of our individual restaurants are subject to the risks and uncertainties described above there is an enhanced level of risk and uncertainty related to the operation and expansion of our newer concepts such as bahama breeze and seasons 52 these concepts have not yet proven their longterm viability or growth potential we have made substantial investments in the development and expansion of each of these concepts and further investment is required while we have implemented a number of changes to operations at bahama breeze and believe we have improved the guest experience and unit economics sufficiently to restart modest unit growth in fiscal 2009 there can be no assurance that these changes will continue to be successful or that new unit growth will occur seasons 52 also is in the very early stages of its development and will require additional resources to support further growth in each case these brands will continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties that accompany any emerging restaurant concept 

our efforts to sell our smokey bones restaurants may not be successful or the restaurants may be sold for less than is expected which could result in further losses and impairments 

on may 5 2007 we closed 54 smokey bones and two rocky river grillhouse restaurants indicated our intention to operate the remaining 73 smokey bones while seeking a buyer and incurred noncash impairment charges relating to these actions we will attempt to sell the closed smokey bones restaurants that are owned and not leased but there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful we intend to offer the remaining operating smokey bones restaurants and related assets for sale but there can be no assurances that we will identify an acceptable buyer or negotiate 

  

acceptable terms of sale if our operating smokey bones restaurants are not sold we may continue to operate or close them either of which could result in further losses and impairment charges even if our smokey bones restaurants whether operating or closed are sold the purchase price could be lower than expected also resulting in further losses and impairments

 restaurants properties – discontinued operations – smokey bones 

on may 5 2007 we closed 54 smokey bones and two rocky river grillhouse restaurants and announced our intention to sell the remaining 73 smokey bones restaurants as of may 27 2007 we continued to operate 73 smokey bones restaurants in the following locations while seeking a buyer and all of these restaurants are reported as a component of discontinued operations 

 

 of our 73 smokey bones restaurants open on may 27 2007 39 were located on owned sites and 34 were located on leased sites 

  

properties – general 

during fiscal 1999 we formed two subsidiary corporations each of which elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust “reit” under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code these elections limit the activities of both corporations to holding certain real estate assets the formation of these two reits is designed primarily to assist us in managing our real estate portfolio and possibly to provide a vehicle to access capital markets in the future 

both reits are nonpublic reits through our subsidiary companies we indirectly own 100 percent of all voting stock and greater than 995 percent of the total value of each reit for financial reporting purposes both reits are included in our consolidated financial statements 

all of the buildings that make up our executive offices culinary center training facilities and supporting warehouses in orange county orlando metro area florida are currently leased on june 20 2006 we entered into an agreement to sell and lease back the 10 buildings that we previously owned the sale and the commencement of our leases for those buildings occurred in august 2006 the initial term of the leases is three years and we have two oneyear renewal options 

we have purchased several adjacent parcels of vacant land in orange county florida and have begun planning to relocate our headquarters to this site we expect our proposed restaurant support center campus at this new location to offer a more collaborative and unified environment with additional room for future growth we anticipate that it will take three or more years to design and build the new restaurant support center campus we currently project completing the first phase of this development during fiscal 2010 

except in limited instances our present restaurant sites and other facilities are not subject to mortgages or encumbrances securing money borrowed by us from outside sources in our opinion our current buildings and equipment generally are in good condition suitable for their purposes and adequate for our current needs see also note 5 “land buildings and equipment net” and note 13 “leases” under notes to consolidated financial statements in our 2007 annual report to shareholders incorporated herein by reference

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend we are subject to private lawsuits administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business a number of these lawsuits proceedings and claims may exist at any given time these matters typically involve claims from guests employees and others related to operational issues common to the restaurant industry and can also involve infringement of or challenges to our trademarks while the resolution of a lawsuit proceeding or claim may have an impact on our financial results for the period in which it is resolved we believe that the final disposition of the lawsuits proceedings and claims in which we are currently involved either individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity the following is a brief description of the more significant of these matters in view of the inherent uncertainties of litigation the outcome of any unresolved matter described below cannot be predicted at this time nor can the amount of any potential loss be reasonably estimated 

like other restaurant companies and retail employers we have been faced in a few states with allegations of purported classwide wage and hour violations in august 2003 three former employees in washington filed a purported class action in washington state superior court in spokane county alleging violations of washington labor laws with respect to providing rest breaks the court stayed the action and ordered the plaintiffs into our mandatory arbitration program although we believe we provided the required rest breaks to our employees we resolved the case through mediation and the settlement agreement received preliminary court approval in june 2007 

in january 2004 a former food server filed a purported class action in california state court alleging that red lobster’s “server banking” policies and practices under which servers settle guest checks directly with customers throughout their shifts and turn in collected monies at the shift’s end improperly required her and other food servers and bartenders to make up cash shortages and walkouts in violation of california law the case was ordered to arbitration as a procedural matter the arbitrator ruled that classwide arbitration is permissible under our dispute resolution program we have filed a petition opposing the arbitrator’s decision no decision on the petition has yet been rendered and no class has been certified in january 2007 plaintiffs’ counsel filed in california state court a second purported class action lawsuit on behalf of servers and bartenders alleging that olive garden’s server banking policy and its alleged failure to pay split shift premiums violated california law we believe that our policies and practices were lawful and that we have strong defenses to both cases 

  

on march 23 2006 we were notified that the staff of the us federal trade commission ftc was conducting an inquiry into the marketing of our gift cards during the inquiry we cooperated with the staff provided information and made some voluntary adjustments to the disclosure of dormancy fees related to our gift cards in october 2006 we discontinued the imposition of dormancy fees in april 2007 without admitting liability we entered into a consent order with the ftc under which we agreed to make certain minimum disclosures should we decide in the future to impose fees in connection with our gift cards to maintain certain records related to gift cards and to restore dormancy fees previously imposed on the cards by its terms the consent order will remain in place until 2027

background 

  

we opened our first restaurant a red lobster in lakeland florida in 1968 red lobster was founded by william b darden for whom we are named we were acquired by general mills inc in 1970 in may 1995 we became a separate publicly held company when general mills distributed all outstanding darden stock to general mills’ stockholders 

  

the number of red lobster and olive garden restaurants open at the end of fiscal 2006 increased by three and 19 respectively as compared to the end of fiscal 2005 red lobster has grown from six restaurants in operation at the end of fiscal 1970 to 682 restaurants in north america by the end of fiscal 2006 olive garden an internally developed concept opened its first restaurant in orlando florida in fiscal 1983 and by the end of fiscal 2006 had expanded to 582 restaurants in north america 

  

bahama breeze is an internally developed concept that provides a caribbean escape offering the food drinks and atmosphere you would find in the islands in fiscal 1996 bahama breeze opened its first restaurant in orlando florida at the end of fiscal 2006 there were 32 bahama breeze restaurants

in february 2003 we opened a new test restaurant in orlando florida called seasons 52 it is a casually sophisticated fresh grill and wine bar with seasonally inspired menus offering fresh ingredients to create great tasting meals that are lower in calories than comparable restaurant meals at the end of fiscal 2006 there were five seasons 52 restaurants

strategy 

  

the restaurant industry is generally considered to be comprised of four segments quick service midscale casual dining and fine dining the industry is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains we believe that capable operators of strong multiunit concepts have the opportunity to increase their share of the casual dining segment we plan to grow by increasing the number of restaurants in each of our existing concepts and by developing or acquiring additional concepts that can be expanded profitably 

  

while we are a leader in the casual dining segment we know we cannot be successful without a clear sense of who we are our core purpose is “to nourish and delight everyone we serve” this core purpose is supported by our core values 

  

   

our mission is to be “the best in casual dining now and for generations” we believe we can achieve this goal by continuing to build on our historical strength as a multibrand casual dining company which is grounded in our commitment to combining the following areas 

  

    

our strategic framework also includes two points that we believe separate us from our competition we are committed to 

  

    

  

  

  

restaurant concepts 

  

red lobster 

  

red lobster is the largest casual dining seafoodspecialty restaurant operator in the united states it offers an extensive menu featuring fresh fish shrimp crab lobster scallops and other seafood in a casual atmosphere the menu includes a variety of specialty seafood and nonseafood entrées appetizers and desserts 

  

most dinner entrée prices range from 875 to 2899 with certain lobster items available by the pound most lunch entrée prices range from 599 to 1199 the price of each entrée includes salad side items and our signature cheddar bay biscuits during fiscal 2006 the average check per person was 1700 to 1800 with alcoholic beverages accounting for approximately 81 percent of red lobster’s sales red lobster maintains approximately 108 different menus across its trade areas to reflect geographic differences in consumer preferences prices and selections as well as a lowerpriced children’s menu   

  

olive garden 

  

olive garden is the market share leader among casual dining italian restaurants in the united states olive garden’s menu includes a variety of authentic italian foods featuring fresh ingredients and an expanded wine list that includes a broad selection of wines imported from italy the menu includes antipasti appetizers soups salad and garlic breadsticks baked pastas sautéed specialties with chicken seafood and fresh vegetables grilled meats and a variety of desserts olive garden also uses coffee imported from italy for its espresso and cappuccino olive garden is in the process of accelerating new restaurant growth through the introduction of two new prototypes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 which are expected to deliver the same guest experience while reducing capital investment and improving operating efficiencies 

  

most dinner entrée prices range from 795 to 1950 and most lunch entrée prices range from 595 to 1025 the price of each entrée also includes as much fresh salad or soup and breadsticks as a guest desires during fiscal 2006 the average check per person was 1400 to 1500 with alcoholic beverages accounting for approximately 83 percent of olive garden’s sales olive garden maintains approximately 42 different dinner menus and 36 lunch menus across its trade areas to reflect geographic differences in consumer preferences prices and selections as well as 13 children’s menus 

  

bahama breeze 

  

bahama breeze is a restaurant that brings guests the feeling of a caribbean escape it offers the food drinks and atmosphere you would find in the islands the menu features distinctive caribbeaninspired fresh seafood chicken and steaks as well as signature specialty drinks the first bahama breeze opened in 1996 and met with strong positive consumer response we continued to test the concept by opening a limited number of additional restaurants in each of the following years and began national expansion of the concept in 1998 while the concept continued to be well received by guests its financial performance did not meet our overall expectations bahama breeze closed six restaurants and wrote down the carrying value of four others during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 reducing to 32 the total number of restaurants in operation and postponed any new restaurant expansion 

  

since fiscal 2004 bahama breeze has implemented a number of changes to become a more relevant brand for its guests evolving its menu to make it more approachable yet still distinctive and improving the guest experience bahama breeze will seek to deliver its strong potential by continuing to elevate the guest experience to be competitively superior and by improving restaurantlevel returns through structural changes to its operations that remove costs and complexity that do not add value for its guests bahama breeze’s focus now is to accelerate progress in these areas before returning to new restaurant growth 

  

most dinner entrée prices at bahama breeze range from 900 to 2200 and most lunch entrée prices range from 700 to 1100 during fiscal 2006 the average check per person was 2200 to 2300 with alcoholic beverages accounting for approximately 243 percent of bahama breeze’s sales bahama breeze maintains 11 different lunch and dinner menus to reflect geographic differences in consumer preferences prices and selections as well as a children’s menu

smokey bones features barbequed pork beef and chicken as well as other grilled favorites all served in a lively yet comfortable mountainlodge setting that features televised sports we opened the first smokey bones in september 1999 and began national expansion of the concept in fiscal 2002 we opened 26 new smokey bones restaurants during fiscal 2006 and had 126 restaurants in operation at the end of the fiscal year softening of sales at smokey bones during fiscal 2006 however led us to reevaluate our new restaurant opening strategy during the third quarter of fiscal 2006 we recorded an impairment charge for five smokey bones restaurants three of which were permanently closed we have identified a new direction for smokey bones that eliminates the barbequecentric parts of the brand that we believe are a barrier to greater occasion breadth and increased frequency during fiscal 2007 we plan to focus on the new direction for the smokey bones brand to increase breadth of appeal and to test the new direction in several remodeled restaurants starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 while limiting its new restaurant openings to the five locations under construction at the end of fiscal 2006 depending on test results we may invest further in a significant repositioning of the smokey bones brand which may include a change of the concept’s name 

  

most smokey bones dinner entrée prices range from 929 to 1599 and most lunch entrée prices range from 649 to 899 during fiscal 2006 the average check per person was 1400 to 1500 with alcoholic beverages accounting for approximately 103 percent of smokey bones’ sales smokey bones maintains approximately 14 different menus across its trade areas to reflect geographic differences in consumer preferences prices and selections as well as a children’s menu 

  

recent and planned growth 

  

during fiscal 2006 we opened 60 new restaurants excluding the relocation of existing restaurants to new sites and the rebuilding of restaurants at existing sites and closed 11 restaurants in addition we had three restaurants closed temporarily at the end of fiscal 2006 two of which we expect to reopen during fiscal 2007 and one we expect to reopen during fiscal 2008 this resulted in a net increase of 46 restaurants in fiscal 2006 we plan to open approximately 3945 new red lobster olive garden smokey bones and seasons 52 restaurants during fiscal 2007 excluding relocations and rebuilds our actual and projected new openings by concept excluding relocations and rebuilds are shown below 

  

   

the actual number of openings for each of our concepts will depend on many factors including our ability to locate appropriate sites negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms obtain necessary local governmental permits complete construction and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel our objective is to continue to expand our current portfolio of restaurant concepts and to develop or acquire additional concepts that can be expanded profitably we have continued to test new ideas and concepts and also to evaluate potential acquisition candidates to assess whether they would satisfy our strategic and financial objectives 

  

we consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant’s longterm success and we devote significant effort to the site selection process prior to entering a market we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors these factors include trade area demographics such as target population density and household income levels competitive influences in the trade area the site’s visibility accessibility and traffic volume and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls hotelmotel complexes offices and universities members of senior management evaluate inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition 

  

  

  

  

constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after permits are obtained and the site is acquired 

  

the following table illustrates the approximate average capital investment size and dining capacity of the 11 red lobster 24 olive garden and 26 smokey bones restaurants that were opened during fiscal 2006 including relocations but excluding rebuilds inline spaces and conversions of existing restaurants 

  

   

1 estimated final cost includes net present value of leases and working capital credit but excludes internal overhead 

2 includes all space under the roof including the coolers and freezers but excludes gazebos pavilions and porte cocheres 

3 includes bar dining seats and patio seating but excludes bar stools 

4 includes patio dining tables 

  

we systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards when a restaurant falls below minimum standards we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes and implement marketing and operational plans to improve that restaurant’s performance if performance does not improve to acceptable levels the restaurant is evaluated for relocation closing or conversion to one of our other concepts 

  

during fiscal 2006 we permanently closed four and relocated three red lobster restaurants permanently closed three and relocated one olive garden restaurant and permanently closed four smokey bones restaurants during fiscal 2006 we also wrote down the carrying value of two smokey bones restaurants which continued to operate we continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future asset impairment charges 

  

restaurant operations 

  

we believe that highquality restaurant management is critical to our longterm success we also believe that our leadership position strong successoriented culture and various shortterm and longterm incentive programs including stock options restricted stock or stock units help attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers 

  

our restaurant management structure varies by concept and restaurant size each restaurant is led by a general manager and three to five additional managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant each restaurant also employs approximately 50180 hourly employees most of whom work parttime we issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes the restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards at our three largest concepts red lobster olive garden and smokey bones restaurant general managers report to directors at red lobster and olive garden each director was responsible for six to 11 restaurants at the end of fiscal 2006 which is our target range for each director at established concepts at smokey bones each director was responsible for four to seven restaurants at the end of fiscal 2006 restaurants are visited regularly by all levels of supervision to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards 

  

each concept’s vice president or director of training together with senior operations executives are responsible for developing and maintaining that concept’s operations training programs these efforts include a 12 to 15week training program for management trainees and continuing development programs for managers supervisors and directors the emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant concept but includes leadership restaurant business management and culinary skills we also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants including deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant 

  

  

  

  

operations the opening training teams typically begin work one week prior to opening and remain at the new restaurant up to three weeks after the opening they are redeployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant’s operating staff 

  

quality assurance 

  

our total quality department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe highquality food in a clean and safe environment through rigorous physical evaluation and testing at our north american laboratories and through “point source inspection” by our international team of quality specialists in several foreign countries we purchase only seafood that meets or exceeds our specifications we use independent third parties to inspect and evaluate commodity vendors in addition any commodity supplier that produces a “high risk” product is subject to a food safety evaluation by darden personnel at least annually we require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive haccp food safety programs in place since 1976 we have required routine microbiological testing of seafood and other commodities for quality and microbiological safety in addition darden total quality managers and third party auditors visit each restaurant periodically throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation the total quality managers also serve as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety 

  

purchasing and distribution 

  

our ability to ensure a consistent supply of highquality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant concepts depends upon procurement from reliable sources our purchasing staff sources negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 2000 suppliers in approximately 45 countries suppliers must meet strict quality control standards in the development harvest catch and production of food products competitive bids longterm contracts and longterm vendor relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products 

  

we believe that our seafood purchasing capabilities are a significant competitive advantage our purchasing staff travels routinely within the united states and internationally to source more than 100 varieties of topquality seafood at competitive prices we believe that we have established excellent longterm relationships with key seafood vendors and usually source our product directly from producers not brokers or middlemen we operate procurement offices in singapore and toronto our only purchasing offices outside of orlando to source products directly from asia and canada while the supply of certain seafood species is volatile we believe we have the ability to identify alternative seafood products and to adjust our menus as necessary all other essential food products are available or can be made available upon short notice from alternative qualified suppliers because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales controlled inventories of specified products are distributed to all restaurants through independent national distribution companies   

  

our supplier diversity program is an integral part of our purchasing efforts through this program we identify minority and womenowned vendors and assist them in establishing supplier relationships with us we are committed to the development and growth of minority and womenowned enterprises and in fiscal 2006 we spent approximately 8 percent and 25 percent respectively of our purchasing dollars with those firms 

  

we continue to invest in new technologies to improve our purchasing and restaurant operations we are in the process of implementing “ikitchen” a webbased software system at all of our restaurants the system is designed to more efficiently handle restaurant product orders receiving invoice approval and inventories 

  

advertising and marketing 

  

we believe we have developed significant marketing and advertising capabilities our size enables us to be a leading advertiser in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry red lobster and olive garden leverage the efficiency of national network television advertising and supplement it with local television advertising bahama breeze and smokey bones do not use national television advertising our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising and product promotions to attract customers we implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase our sales and profits we also rely on radio and newspaper advertising as 

  

  

  

  

well as newspaper and direct mail coupon programs as appropriate to attract customers we have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor customer satisfaction and evolving expectations 

  

employees 

  

at the end of fiscal 2006 we employed approximately 157300 persons of these employees approximately 1300 were corporate or restaurant concept personnel located in our restaurant support center in orlando florida approximately 6300 were restaurant management personnel in the restaurants or in field offices and the remainder were hourly restaurant personnel of the restaurant support center employees approximately 60 percent were management personnel and the balance were administrative or office employees our operating executives have an average of more than 13 years of experience with us the restaurant general managers average 12 years with us we believe that we provide working conditions and compensation that compare favorably with those of our competitors most employees other than restaurant management and corporate management are paid on an hourly basis none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our employee relations to be good 

  

information technology 

  

we strive for leadership in the restaurant business by using technology as a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy since 1975 computers located in the restaurants have been used to assist in the management of the restaurants we have implemented systems targeted at improved financial control cost management enhanced guest service and improved employee effectiveness management information systems are designed to be used across restaurant concepts yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant concept several years ago we implemented a suite of webenabled and fully integrated financial and human resource including payroll and benefits systems we also implemented a highspeed data network connecting all restaurants to all current and anticipated future applications in the past year we began the implementation of “dash” a next generation technology platform for our restaurant point of sale system we expect to deploy the new platform including new hardware and software to all restaurant concepts over the next two years we are also in the process of implementing “ikitchen” a webbased software system designed to more efficiently handle restaurant product orders and other related matters as discussed above under “purchasing and distribution” 

  

restaurant hardware and software support is provided or coordinated from the restaurant support center in orlando florida seven days a week 24 hours a day a communications network sends and receives critical business data to and from the restaurants throughout the day and night providing timely and extensive information on business activity in every location the restaurant support center houses our data center which contains sufficient computing power to process information from all restaurants quickly and efficiently our information is processed in a secured environment to protect both the actual data and the physical assets we guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan which includes storing critical business information offsite testing the disaster recovery plan at a hotsite facility and providing onsite power backup via a large diesel generator we use internally developed proprietary software as well as purchased software with proven nonproprietary hardware this allows processing power to be distributed effectively to each of our restaurants 

  

our management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates will position us well to support current needs and future growth we are committed to maintaining an industry leadership position in information systems and computing technology we use a strategic information systems planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic financial regulatory and other business advantage criteria 

  

competition 

  

the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food price service restaurant location personnel concept attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing the restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional or local economic conditions demographic trends traffic patterns the type number and location of competing restaurants and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power we compete within each market with national and regional chains and 

  

  

  

  

locallyowned restaurants for customers management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites we also face growing competition from the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section we expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas 

  

other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled “purchasing and distribution” “advertising and marketing” “information technology” and “risk factors” elsewhere in this report 

  

trademarks and related agreements

seasonality 

  

our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally during fiscal 2006 and 2005 our sales were highest in the spring and winter followed by summer and lowest in the fall during fiscal 2004 our sales were highest in the spring lowest in the fall and comparable during winter and summer holidays severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions 

  

government regulation 

  

we are subject to various federal state and local laws affecting our business each of our restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities which include health safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located the development and operation of restaurants depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites which are subject to zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations to date we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals 

  

during fiscal 2006 approximately 89 percent of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site in most cases on an annual basis and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time these regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant operation including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours of operation advertising wholesale purchasing inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages the failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these licenses would adversely affect the restaurant’s operations we also are subject in certain states to “dramshop” statutes which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person who then causes injury to himself or a third party we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance 

  

we also are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws governing such matters as overtime tip credits working conditions safety standards and hiring and employment practices changes in these laws during fiscal 2006 have not had a material effect on our operations

 item 1a ris k factors 

  

various risks and uncertainties could affect our business any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations therefore the following is not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

  

we face intense competition and if we are unable to continue to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

the casual dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing service location personnel and type and quality of food and there are many wellestablished competitors we compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locallyowned restaurants we also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery deli and restaurant services particularly in the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section we compete primarily on the quality variety and value perception of menu items the number and location of restaurants type of concept quality and efficiency of service attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors we anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors if we are unable to continue to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and certain general economic factors that are largely out of our control may adversely affect our results of operations 

our business results depend on a number of industryspecific and general economic factors many of which are beyond our control the casual dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in national regional and local economic conditions seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes consumer preferences including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant concepts and consumer spending patterns the performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends severe weather including hurricanes traffic patterns the price and availability of gasoline and the type number and location of competing restaurants 

in addition general economic conditions such as recessionary economic cycles a protracted economic slowdown a worsening economy or industrywide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings furthermore we cannot predict the effects of actual or threatened armed conflicts or terrorist attacks efforts to combat terrorism military action against any foreign state or group located in a foreign state or heightened security requirements on the economy or consumer confidence in the united states any of these events could also affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures 

unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our customers could increase our costs reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

  

  

the price and availability of food ingredients and utilities used by our restaurants could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food ingredients utilities and other related costs over which we may have little control operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities including shrimp lobster crab and other seafood as well as beef pork chicken cheese and produce the introduction of or changes to tariffs on imported shrimp or other food products could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products we are subject to the general risks of inflation in addition possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items caused by inclement weather or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability quality and cost of the items we buy our restaurants’ operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as natural gas whether as a result of inflation or otherwise on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs 

our restaurant operations are subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages working conditions overtime and tip credits we have a substantial number of employees who are paid wage rates at or slightly above the minimum wage as federal and state minimum wage rates increase we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage labor shortages and increased employee turnover could also increase our labor costs if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices our profitability may decline in addition the current premiums that we pay for our insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property health and directors’ and officers’ liability may increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs the dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers’ compensation and general liability insurance for which we carry high perclaim deductibles may also increase at any time thereby further increasing our costs further the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses 

increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our results of operations 

if our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions if our advertising media or marketing expenses increase or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than that of our competitors we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may experience higherthananticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our revenues and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants we incur substantial preopening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close relocate or remodel existing restaurants the expenses of opening closing relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated an increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees consumers suppliers shareholders or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time the cost to defend future litigation may be significant there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of our services regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable as a result litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

  

  

unfavorable publicity could harm our business 

multiunit restaurant businesses such as ours can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from complaints or litigation alleging poor food quality foodborne illness personal injury adverse health effects including obesity or other concerns negative publicity may also result from actual or alleged violations by our restaurants of “dram shop” laws which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or to a third party regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants or only to a single restaurant could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of food safety could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

the success of our restaurants depends in large part on their location as demographic and economic patterns change current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced revenues in those locations in addition desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation the occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

we are subject to a number of risks relating to federal state and local regulation of our business that may increase our costs and decrease our profit margins 

the restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including those relating to building and zoning requirements and those relating to the preparation and sale of food the development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites which are subject to zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations and requirements we are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health sanitation safety and fire standards and liquor licenses federal and state laws governing our relationships with employees including the fair labor standards act of 1938 and the immigration reform and control act of 1986 and applicable requirements concerning the minimum wage overtime family leave tip credits working conditions safety standards and immigration status federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities such as the americans with disabilities act of 1990 in addition we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge emission and disposal of hazardous materials the impact of current laws and regulations the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal state and local authorities could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability 

our growth through the opening of new restaurants and the development or acquisition of new dining concepts may not be successful and could result in poor financial performance 

as part of our business strategy we intend to continue to expand our current portfolio of restaurant concepts and to develop or acquire additional concepts that can be expanded profitably this strategy involves numerous risks and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives we may not be able to open all of our planned new restaurants and the new restaurants that we open may not be profitable or as profitable as our existing restaurants new restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize and even sales at successful newlyopened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation the opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on sales levels at existing restaurants there are additional risks involved with expanding newer concepts such as bahama breeze and smokey bones that have not yet proven their longterm viability furthermore we may not be able to develop or acquire additional concepts that are as profitable as our existing restaurants growth through acquisitions may involve additional risks for example we may pay too much for a concept relative to the actual 

  

  

  

  

economic return be required to borrow funds to make our acquisition which would increase our interest expense or be unable to integrate an acquired concept into our operations 

the ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations the need to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses on a timely basis the need to comply with other regulatory requirements the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay construction increases in labor and building materials costs the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms changes in weather or other acts of god that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions at each potential location we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites construction contractors management personnel hourly employees and other resources if we are unable to successfully manage these risks we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues and earnings in future periods 

our plans to improve financial performance at bahama breeze and smokey bones and reposition the smokey bones brand may not be successful which could require us to make substantial further investments in those concepts and result in further losses and impairments 

  

while each of our restaurant concepts as well as each of our individual restaurants are subject to the risks and uncertainties described above there is an enhanced level of risk and uncertainty related to the operation and expansion of our newer concepts such as bahama breeze and smokey bones these concepts have not yet proven their longterm viability or growth potential we have made substantial investments in the development and expansion of each of these concepts and further investment is required in order to bring the financial performance of these concepts to acceptable levels until we have improved the financial performance of bahama breeze and smokey bones further growth of those concepts has been postponed while we have identified and continue to implement a number of structural changes to operations at bahama breeze those changes may not be successful in improving guest experience and restaurantlevel returns at smokey bones we believe we have identified significant barriers to greater occasion breadth and increased frequency that we must eliminate or reduce our plan to change the direction of smokey bones in order to address these issues has not yet been tested and may not be successful if the test is not successful we may incur further losses and impairment charges at that concept even if the test results are positive we will need to make substantial additional investments in order to reposition the smokey bones brand and the new brand will be subject to the risks and uncertainties that accompany any emerging restaurant concept

as of may 28 2006 we operated 1427 restaurants including 682 red lobster 582 olive garden 32 bahama breeze 126 smokey bones and five seasons 52 restaurants in the following locations 

  

   

of our 1427 restaurants open on may 28 2006 850 were located on owned sites and 577 were located on leased sites the 577 leases are classified as follows 

  

   

during fiscal 1999 we formed two subsidiary corporations each of which elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust “reit” under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code these elections limit the activities of both corporations to holding certain real estate assets the formation of these two reits is designed primarily to assist us in managing our real estate portfolio and possibly to provide a vehicle to access capital markets in the future 

  

both reits are nonpublic reits through our subsidiary companies we indirectly own 100 percent of all voting stock and greater than 995 percent of the total value of each reit for financial reporting purposes both reits are included in our consolidated financial statements 

  

of the 15 buildings that make up our executive offices culinary center training facilities and supporting warehouses in orange county orlando metro area florida we currently own 10 and lease five on june 20 2006 we entered into an agreement to sell and lease back the 10 owned buildings subject to certain conditions the sale is expected to close in august 2006 the initial term of the leases would be three years with two oneyear renewal options we also have assembled several adjacent parcels of vacant land in orange county florida and have announced our intention to relocate our headquarters to this site we expect it will take three or more years to design and build a new restaurant support center campus and no definitive timetable has as yet been established 

  

except in limited instances our present restaurant sites and other facilities are not subject to mortgages or encumbrances securing money borrowed by us from outside sources in our opinion our current buildings and equipment generally are in good condition suitable for their purposes and adequate for our current needs but we expect the new restaurant support center campus to offer a more collaborative and unified environment with additional room for future growth see also note 4 “land buildings and equipment net” and note 12 “leases” under notes to consolidated financial statements in our 2006 annual report to shareholders incorporated herein by reference 

  

  

  

  




 item 3 leg al proceedings 

we are subject to private lawsuits administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business a number of these lawsuits proceedings and claims may exist at any given time these matters typically involve claims from guests employees and others related to operational issues common to the restaurant industry and can also involve infringement of or challenges to our trademarks while the resolution of a lawsuit proceeding or claim may have an impact on our financial results for the period in which it is resolved we believe that the final disposition of the lawsuits proceedings and claims in which we are currently involved either individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity the following is a brief description of the more significant of these matters in view of the inherent uncertainties of litigation the outcome of any unresolved matter described below cannot be predicted at this time nor can the amount of any potential loss be reasonably estimated 

like other restaurant companies and retail employers we have been faced in a few states with allegations of purported classwide wage and hour violations in march 2002 and march 2003 two purported class action lawsuits were brought against us in the superior court of orange county california by three current and former hourly restaurant employees alleging violations of california labor laws with respect to providing meal and rest breaks although we continue to believe we provided the required meal and rest breaks to our employees to avoid potentially costly and protracted litigation we agreed during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 to settle both lawsuits and a similar case filed in sacramento county for approximately 95 million terms of the settlement did not include any admission of liability by us and all settlement proceeds were paid as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2006 

in august 2003 three former employees in washington filed a similar purported class action in washington state superior court in spokane county alleging violations of washington labor laws with respect to providing rest breaks the court stayed the action and ordered the plaintiffs into our mandatory arbitration program we believe we provided the required meal and rest breaks to our employees and we intend to vigorously defend our position in this case 

beginning in 2002 a total of five purported class action lawsuits were filed in superior courts of california two each in los angeles county and orange county and one in sacramento county in which the plaintiffs allege that they and other current and former service managers beverage and hospitality managers and culinary managers were improperly classified as exempt employees under california labor laws the plaintiffs sought unpaid overtime wages and penalties two of the cases were removed to arbitration under our mandatory arbitration program one was stayed to allow consideration of judicial coordination with the other cases one is proceeding as an individual claim and one remains a purported class action litigation matter although we continue to believe we correctly classified these employees to avoid potentially costly and protracted litigation we agreed in february 2006 to a tentative settlement without admitting any liability we agreed to pay up to a maximum total of 11 million to settle all five cases of which 9 million was recognized during fiscal 2006 and is included in selling general and administrative expenses the tentative settlement will be documented in a full settlement agreement and must have court approval we cannot predict when the settlement will be final but estimate preliminary court approval will occur in the first half of fiscal 2007 with final court approval and payment of the settlement proceeds no earlier than the second quarter of fiscal 2007 

on march 23 2006 we received a notice that the staff of the us federal trade commission ftc was conducting an inquiry into the marketing of our gift cards we have been cooperating with the staff providing information and making some voluntary adjustments to the disclosure of dormancy fees that may be imposed on the cards on july 26 2006 we were notified that the ftc staff had concluded that we had violated section 5 of the ftc act which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts and practices the staff asserts that we did not give adequate notice to consumers that our gift cards if not used for 24 consecutive months are subject to a gradual reduction in value by a dormancy fee the notice included a proposed consent order and indicated that if negotiations based on the order were not successful within 30 days the staff would recommend to the ftc bureau director that a complaint a copy of which was enclosed be filed in federal district court the proposed consent order included among other things for negotiation an opening suggestion that we provide equitable monetary relief in the amount of 31006630 suspend the collection of dormancy fees on previously issued gift cards and make certain disclosures relating to dormancy fees we believe that our gift card marketing practices comply with applicable laws we have not yet determined a course of action but have continued to discuss the matter with the ftc staff

strategy

     the  restaurant  industry is generally  considered  to be comprised of four
segments quick service  midscale  casual dining and fine dining the industry
is highly  fragmented and includes many independent  operators and small chains
we  believe  that  capable  operators  of strong  multiunit  concepts  have the
opportunity  to increase  their share of the casual dining  segment  we plan to
grow by increasing the number of  restaurants  in each of our existing  concepts
and by  developing  or  acquiring  additional  concepts  that  can  be  expanded
profitably

     while we are a leader in the casual  dining  segment  we know we cannot be
successful  without a clear sense of who we are our core purpose is to nourish
and  delight  everyone we serve  this core  purpose is  supported  by our core
values

         o    integrity and fairness
         o    respect and caring
         o    diversity
         o    always learningalways teaching
         o    being of service
         o    teamworkand
         o    excellence

     our mission is to be the best in casual dining  now and for generations
four strategic imperatives support our mission

         o    leadership excellence at all levels
         o    brand building excellence
         o    service and hospitality excellence and
         o    culinary and beverage excellence

     we also have two  strategic  enablers  we  believe  can help us  accelerate
progress in each strategic imperative these enablers are

         o    diversity excellence that embraces and builds upon our
              differences and
         o    process and technology excellence that maximize organizational
              effectiveness and drive both discipline and nimbleness

     new to our strategic framework is the explicit statement of two points that
have been  implicit in our approach to the business for many years now and that
we believe separate us from our competition we are committed to

         o    being a multibrand restaurant company that is bound together by
              common operating practices and a unifying culture which serves to
              make us stronger than the sum of our parts and
         o    listening to our guests and employees for insights we need to
              create powerful broadly appealing brands and to develop
              successful people

bahama breeze

     bahama  breeze  is a  caribbeanthemed  restaurant  that  offers  guests  a
distinctive island dining experience the first bahama breeze opened in 1996 and
met with strong positive consumer response  we continued to test the concept by
opening a limited  number of  additional  restaurants  in each of the  following
years  and  began  national  expansion  of the  concept  in 1998  the  concept
continues to be well received by guests  although its financial performance has
not met our overall expectations bahama breeze closed six restaurants and wrote
down the carrying value of four others during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004
reducing to 32 the total  number of  restaurants  in  operation  in addition to
closing the underperforming  restaurants  we have made recent changes that have
improved the sales  financial  performance  and  longterm  potential of bahama
breeze  these changes include  implementing  lunch  operations  creating a new
dinner menu and slowing new  restaurant  development  we also are  reducing the
size of a typical bahama breeze building and the related capital  investment  a
new  reducedinvestment  prototype building opened in pittsburgh  pa during the
fourth  quarter of fiscal 2004 and the early  results are  encouraging  we have
postponed  any new  restaurant  expansion at bahama breeze while we evaluate the
new prototype in the meantime the closure of some underperforming  restaurants
during  fiscal  2004  allows  bahama  breeze  to focus  on its  most  profitable
restaurants as it builds its business

smokey bones

grilled favorites all served in a lively yet comfortable mountainlodge setting

has been well received by consumers and continues to expand  rapidly  we opened
30 new smokey bones  restaurants  during fiscal 2004  and had 69 restaurants in
operation  at the end of the  fiscal  year  we plan to open 30 to 40 new smokey
bones

                                       5

restaurants  in fiscal 2005  we believe that smokey bones has strong  expansion
potential  and is capable of  achieving  future  annual sales of 500 million or
more

recent and planned growth

     during fiscal 2004 we opened 66 new restaurants  excluding the relocation
of  existing  restaurants  to new sites and the  rebuilding  of  restaurants  at
existing  sites  and  closed  eight  restaurants  in  addition  we  had  four
restaurants  closed  temporarily  at the end of  fiscal  2004  that we expect to
reopen during fiscal 2005  this resulted in a net increase of 54 restaurants in
fiscal 2004 we plan to open approximately 4965 new red lobster  olive garden
smokey  bones  and  seasons  52  restaurants   during  fiscal  2005   excluding
relocations  and  rebuilds  our actual and  projected  new openings by concept

          totals          66                 4965

     our objective is to continue to expand our current  portfolio of restaurant
concepts  and to develop or acquire  additional  concepts  that can be expanded
profitably  we have  continued  to test new  ideas  and  concepts  and also to
evaluate potential  acquisition  candidates to assess whether they would satisfy
our strategic and financial  objectives  at present we have not identified any
specific acquisitions

     in fiscal 2005 we will limit new restaurant expansion at red lobster while
we continue to focus on improving operational returns for that concept at olive
garden  we will  continue  to  focus on  maintaining  operational  returns  and
expanding  that  concept to high  potential  sites that we believe can  generate
significant  returns on our investments  olive gardens  expansion will include
its  recently   developed  tuscan   farmhouse  design  an  outgrowth  of  our
collaboration with rocca delle macie a familyowned  winery in tuscany  italy
we have postponed any new restaurant openings at bahama breeze while we evaluate
the new reducedinvestment  prototype restaurant opened in pittsburgh pa during
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we plan to continue to expand smokey bones in
fiscal 2005 at a pace that we believe will enable each new restaurant to capture
the concepts full potential we plan to open two to three additional seasons 52
restaurants  in fiscal 2005 to further  explore  the  concepts  viability  the
actual  number of openings for each of our concepts will depend on many factors
including our ability to locate appropriate sites negotiate acceptable purchase
or  lease  terms   obtain  necessary  local  governmental   permits   complete
construction and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel

     we consider  location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurants
longterm  success  and we  devote  significant  effort  to the site  selection
process  prior to entering a market  we conduct a thorough  study to determine
the optimal  number and placement of  restaurants  our site  selection  process
incorporates a variety of analytical  techniques to evaluate key factors  these
factors include trade area  demographics  such as target population density and
household  income levels  competitive  influences in the trade area the sites
visibility  accessibility and traffic volume and proximity to activity centers
such as shopping malls hotelmotel complexes offices and universities members
of senior management evaluate inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to
its acquisition  constructing and opening a new restaurant  typically takes 120
to 180 days after permits are obtained and the site is acquired

     the following table illustrates the approximate average capital investment
size and dining capacity of the nine red lobster  23 olive garden and 30 smokey
bones  restaurants  that were opened during fiscal 2004 excluding  relocations
rebuilds and conversions of existing restaurants

6  excludes one center city urban olive garden restaurant whose size is larger
     and cost is  significantly  higher than the average  and  therefore  is not

     we systematically  review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that
each one meets our standards  when a restaurant falls below minimum  standards
we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes and implement  marketing
and operational plans to improve that restaurants  performance  if performance
does  not  improve  to  acceptable  levels  the  restaurant  is  evaluated  for
relocation closing or conversion to one of our other concepts

     during fiscal 2004 we permanently closed two and relocated ten red lobster
restaurants  during the same period  we relocated one olive garden  restaurant
and permanently closed our one remaining olive garden cafe in addition  during
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we closed six bahama breeze  restaurants  and
wrote down the carrying value of four other bahama breeze restaurants one olive
garden restaurant  and one red lobster restaurant  which continued to operate
the decision to close or write down the carrying  value of the  restaurants  was
the result of our ongoing  analysis that examines  restaurants  not meeting our
minimum return on investment  thresholds and certain other operating performance
criteria  the decision to close and writedown the carrying value of the bahama
breeze  restaurants also reflected an analysis of each  restaurants  ability to
successfully implement the changes effected over the past year to improve sales
financial performance and overall longterm potential of the concept including
the addition of lunch and adoption of a new dinner menu  the  writedown of the
carrying value of the one olive garden restaurant and one red lobster restaurant
was a result of  lessthanoptimal  locations  we continue to evaluate our site
locations in order to minimize the risk of future asset impairment charges

restaurant operations

     we believe  that  highquality  restaurant  management  is  critical to our
longterm  success  we  also  believe  that  our  leadership  position  strong
successoriented   culture  and  various  shortterm  and  longterm   incentive
programs including stock options restricted stock or stock units help attract
and retain highly motivated restaurant managers

     our restaurant  management structure varies by concept and restaurant size
each  restaurant  is led by a  general  manager  and  three  to five  additional
managers  depending  on  the  operating  complexity  and  sales  volume  of the
restaurant  each  restaurant  also  employs  approximately  65  to  140  hourly
employees  most of whom work parttime  we issue detailed  operations  manuals
covering  all aspects of  restaurant  operations  as well as food and  beverage
manuals which detail the preparation  procedures of our formulated recipes  the
restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each
restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards  at our two
largest  concepts  red lobster and olive garden  restaurant  general  managers
report to directors each director was responsible for five to 11 restaurants at
the end of fiscal 2004  compared to our target range of seven to 12 restaurants
for  each  director   restaurants  are  visited  regularly  by  all  levels  of
supervision to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards

     each concepts vice president or director of training together with senior
operations  executives  is  responsible  for developing  and  maintaining  that
concepts  operations  training programs  these efforts include a 12

to 15week training program for management trainees  and continuing development
programs for managers  supervisors and directors  the emphasis of the training
and development  programs varies by restaurant concept but includes leadership
restaurant  business  management  and  culinary  skills  we also  use a  highly
structured  training  program  to  open  new  restaurants  including  deploying
training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations  the opening
training teams  typically begin work one week prior to opening and remain at the
new  restaurant  one  week  following  the  opening  they  are  redeployed  as
appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurants operating staff

quality assurance

     our total  quality  department  helps ensure that all  restaurants  provide
safe  highquality  food in a clean  and  safe  environment  through  rigorous
physical  evaluation and testing at our north american  laboratories and through
point source  inspection by our international  team of quality  specialists in
several  foreign  countries  we purchase only seafood that meets or exceeds our
specifications  we use  independent  third  parties  to  inspect  and  evaluate
commodity  vendors  in addition  any commodity  supplier that produces a high
risk  product is subject to a minimum  annual food safety  evaluation by darden
personnel  we require our suppliers to maintain sound  manufacturing  practices
and operate with the comprehensive haccp food safety programs in place

     since 1976 we have  maintained a  microbiological  laboratory to routinely
test seafood and other  commodities for quality and  microbiological  safety in
addition  darden total  quality  managers and third party  auditors  visit each
restaurant  periodically  throughout  the year to review  food  handling  and to
provide education and training in food safety and sanitation  the total quality
managers  also serve as a liaison to regulatory  agencies on issues  relating to
food safety

purchasing and distribution

     our ability to ensure a consistent supply of highquality food and supplies
at competitive prices to all of our restaurant concepts depends upon procurement
from reliable  sources  our purchasing staff sources  negotiates and purchases
food and supplies from more than 2000 suppliers in 45 countries suppliers must
meet strict quality control  standards in the  development  harvest  catch and
production of food products competitive bids longterm contracts and longterm
vendor  relationships  are  routinely  used to manage  availability  and cost of
products

     we believe  that our  seafood  purchasing  capabilities  are a  significant
competitive advantage  our purchasing staff travels routinely within the united
states and  internationally  to source more than 100  varieties  of  topquality
seafood at competitive  prices  we believe that we have  established  excellent
longterm relationships with key seafood vendors and usually source our product
directly from  producers  not brokers or  middlemen  we operate a procurement
office in singapore  our only purchasing  office outside of orlando  to source
products  directly  from asia  while the supply of certain  seafood  species is
volatile  we believe that we have the ability to identify  alternative  seafood
products and to adjust our menus as necessary all other essential food products
are  available  or can be made available  upon short notice  from  alternative
qualified suppliers because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food
products inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in
relation to sales  controlled inventories of specified products are distributed
to all restaurants through independent national distribution companies

     our  supplier  diversity  program  is an  integral  part of our  purchasing
efforts  through it we identify  minority and  womenowned  vendors and assist
them in  establishing  supplier  relationships  with us we are committed to the
development  and growth of minority and womenowned  enterprises  and in fiscal
2004 we spent  more than five  percent  and one  percent  respectively  of our
purchasing dollars with those firms

advertising and marketing

     we believe that we have  developed  significant  marketing and  advertising
capabilities  our size  enables  us to be a leading  advertiser  in the  casual
dining segment of the restaurant industry red lobster and olive garden leverage
the efficiency of national network television advertising and supplement it with
local television advertising bahama breeze and smokey bones do not use national
television advertising  our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers

collective bargaining agreement we consider our employee relations to be good

information technology

     we strive for leadership in the restaurant  business by using technology as
a competitive  advantage and as an enabler for our  strategic  building  blocks
since 1975 computers located in the restaurants have been used to assist in the
management of the restaurants  we have implemented systems targeted at improved
financial control cost management enhanced guest service and improved employee
effectiveness  management  information  systems are  designed to be used across
restaurant  concepts  yet are flexible  enough to meet the unique needs of each
restaurant  concept  in the past three years  we have  implemented  a suite of
webenabled and fully integrated financial and human resource including payroll
and benefits systems  we also implemented a highspeed data network connecting
all restaurants to all current and anticipated future applications

     restaurant  hardware and software  support is provided or coordinated  from
the restaurant support center in orlando florida seven days a week 24 hours a
day a communications  network sends and receives  critical business data to and
from  the  restaurants  throughout  the  day and  night  providing  timely  and
extensive  information on business  activity in every  location  the restaurant
support center houses our data center which contains sufficient computing power
to  process  information  from all  restaurants  quickly  and  efficiently  our
information  is  processed in a secured  environment  to protect both the actual
data  and the  physical  assets  we  guard  against  business  interruption  by
maintaining a disaster  recovery plan which includes storing critical  business
information offsite  testing the disaster recovery plan at a hotsite facility
and  providing  onsite  power  backup  via a  large  diesel  generator  we use
internally developed proprietary  software as well as purchased software  with
proven nonproprietary hardware this allows processing power to be distributed
effectively to each of our restaurants

     our  management   believes  that  our  current   systems  and  practice  of
implementing  regular updates will position us well to support current needs and
future growth we are committed to maintaining an industry  leadership  position

systems planning process that involves senior  management and is integrated into
our overall  business  planning  information  systems  projects are prioritized
based  upon  strategic  financial  regulatory  and  other  business  advantage
criteria

competition

     the restaurant  industry is intensely  competitive with respect to the type
and quality of food price service  restaurant location  personnel  concept
attractiveness  of facilities  and  effectiveness of advertising and marketing
the  restaurant  business  is often  affected  by  changes in  consumer  tastes
national  regional or local economic  conditions  demographic trends  traffic
patterns the type number and location of competing restaurants and consumers
discretionary  purchasing power we compete within each market with national and
regional  chains and  locallyowned  restaurants  for customers  management and
hourly   personnel  and  suitable  real  estate  sites  we  also  face  growing
competition from the supermarket  industry  which offers  convenient meals in
the form of improved  entrees and side dishes from the deli  section  we expect
intense competition to continue in all of these areas

trademarks and related agreements

     we regard our  darden  restaurantsr  red  lobsterr  olive  gardenr
bahama  breezer  smokey  bones  barbeque  grillsm and seasons  52sm  service
marks and other variations of these service marks as having  significant value
and as being  important in marketing  the  restaurants  our policy is to pursue
registration  of our  important  service  marks  and  trademarks  and to  oppose
vigorously any infringement of them  generally  with  appropriate  renewal and
use the registration of our service marks will continue indefinitely

     our only restaurant  operations outside of north america  historically have
been  conducted  through an area  development  and franchise  agreement with red
lobster  japan  co  ltd  red  lobster  japan  an  unaffiliated  japanese
corporation  red lobster japan operated 38 red lobster  restaurants in japan as
of may 30 2004 we do not have an ownership  interest in red lobster japan but
receive royalty income under the franchise agreement  the amount of this income
is not material to our consolidated financial statements

seasonality

     our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally  during fiscal years 2004 2003 and
2002  our sales were highest in the spring  lowest in the fall and comparable
during winter and summer  holidays  severe weather and similar  conditions may
impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions

government regulation

     we are  subject to various  federal  state and local  laws  affecting  our
business  each of our restaurants  must comply with licensing  requirements and
regulations  by a number of  governmental  authorities  which  include  health
safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is
located  the development  and operation of restaurants  depend on selecting and
acquiring suitable sites which are subject to zoning land use  environmental
traffic and other regulations  to date we have not been significantly affected
by any difficulty delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals

     presently  about 93 percent of our sales are  attributable  to the sale of
alcoholic beverages  regulations governing their sale require licensure by each
site in most  cases  on an annual  basis  and  licenses  may be  revoked  or
suspended  for cause at any time  these  regulations  relate to many aspects of
restaurant operation  including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours
of operation advertising wholesale purchasing inventory control and handling
and storage and dispensing of alcoholic  beverages  the failure of a restaurant
to obtain or retain  these  licenses  would  adversely  affect the  restaurants
operations we also are subject in certain states to dramshop statutes which
generally  provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment  that
serves alcoholic  beverages to an intoxicated  person who then causes injury to
himself or a third  party  we carry  liquor  liability  coverage as part of our
comprehensive general liability insurance

     we also are subject to federal and state  minimum  wage laws and other laws
governing  such matters as overtime  tip credits  working  conditions  safety
standards  and hiring and  employment  practices  changes in these laws during
fiscal 2004 have not had a material effect on our operations

     we currently are operating under a tip rate alternative commitment trac
agreement with the internal revenue service  through increased  educational and
other efforts in the restaurants  the trac agreement  reduces the likelihood of
potential chainwide employeronly fica assessments for unreported tips

     we are subject to federal and state  environmental  regulations  but these
rules have not had a material  effect on our  operations  during  fiscal  2004
there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities
and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated

     the following  factors  risks and  uncertainties  have affected  and may
continue to affect  our operating  results and the environment  within which we
conduct our  business  if our  projections  and estimates  regarding  these key
factors differ  materially from what actually  occurs  our actual results could
vary  significantly  from  the  performance  projected  in  our  forwardlooking
statements

     competition  the  casual  dining  sector  of the  restaurant  industry  is
intensely competitive in pricing  service  location  personnel  and type and
quality of food  we compete with  national  regional  and local  organizations
primarily  through the quality  variety and value perception of menu items the
number and location of restaurants  type of concept  quality and efficiency of
service  attractiveness  of facilities and  effectiveness  of  advertising  and
marketing  programs  are also  important  factors  we  anticipate  that intense
competition will continue in all of these areas

     economic  market and other  conditions  certain  risks are endemic to the
restaurant and retail  industry in general  a protracted  economic  slowdown or
worsening economy  industrywide  cost pressures  or public safety conditions
including  ongoing  concerns about  terrorism  threats or the  continuing  armed
conflict in iraq  could affect  consumer  behavior and spending for  restaurant
dining occasions and lead to  samerestaurant  sales declines and lower profits
the casual  dining sector of the  restaurant  industry is affected by changes in
national  regional  and  local  economic  conditions  the  seasonality  of our
business  consumer  preferences  including  changes in consumer tastes and the
level of consumer  acceptance  of our  restaurant  concepts  consumer  spending
patterns  demographic trends  weather  traffic patterns and the type number
and location of competing  restaurants  our ability to undertake new restaurant
development  as well as improvements and additions to existing restaurants  is
affected  by economic  conditions  including  interest  rates  and  government
policies  impacting land and construction costs and the cost and availability of
borrowed funds

     price and  availability  of food  labor  utilities  insurance and media
other  costs  our  profitability   depends  significantly  on  our  ability  to
anticipate and react to changes in the price and  availability  of food  labor
utilities  insurance  including  workers  compensation   general  liability
health and directors and officers liability insurance advertising media and
marketing  employee  benefits  and other  costs over which we may have  little
control  the price and  availability  of  commodities  including  among other
things shrimp  lobster crab and other seafood are subject to fluctuation and
could  increase or decrease more than we expect  tariffs on imported  shrimp or
other  commodities  could  increase our costs and possibly  impact the supply of
those  goods  we are  subject to the general  risk of  inflation  and  possible
shortages  or  interruptions  in supply  caused by  inclement  weather  or other
conditions that could adversely affect the availability and cost of the items we
buy  restaurant  preopening  expenses could be more than  expected  and labor
shortages  increased  employee turnover and higher minimum wage rates all could
raise our cost of doing  business  our business  also is subject to the risk of
litigation by employees consumers  suppliers  shareholders or others that may
result in additional  costs  there can be no assurance that  management will be
able to  anticipate  and react to these cost issues  without a material  adverse
effect on our  profitability  and results of operations

     unfavorable  publicityrelating to food safety or other concerns multiunit
restaurant  businesses  can be adversely  affected by publicity  resulting  from
complaints  or  litigation  alleging  poor  food  quality  foodborne  illness
personal injury  adverse health effects including obesity or other operational
concerns  negative  publicity may also result from actual or alleged violations
of dram shop laws that may impose  liability  on sellers of liquors when a third
party  is  injured  as a result  of  intoxication  regardless  of  whether  the
allegations are valid  unfavorable  publicity relating to just one or a limited
number of restaurants  could taint public  perception of the entire brand  such
unfavorable publicity and overall consumer perceptions of food safety could have
a material adverse effect on our business

     importance of locations  the success of our  restaurants  depends in large
part on location there can be no assurance that current locations will continue
to  be  attractive   as  demographic  patterns  change  possible  declines  in
neighborhoods where restaurants are located or economic conditions  surrounding
those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations

     government  regulation and litigation  we are subject to various  federal
state and local laws affecting our business  the  development  and operation of
restaurants  depend to a significant  extent on the selection and acquisition of
suitable sites which are subject to zoning  land use  environmental  traffic
and other regulations  restaurant  operations are also subject to licensing and
regulation by state and local departments  relating to health  liquor licenses
sanitation  and safety  standards  federal and state labor laws  including the
fair labor  standards act and applicable  minimum wage  requirements  overtime
working and safety conditions and citizenship requirements  federal and state
laws which  prohibit  discrimination  and other laws  regulating  the design and
operation of facilities such as the americans with disabilities act of 1990 we
cannot predict the effect on our operations of these laws and  regulations  the
future enactment of additional  legislation regulating these and other areas or
actual or potential  litigation in  connection  with current and future laws and
regulations

     growth plans there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our
growth objectives or that new restaurants opened or acquired will be profitable
there are inherent  risks  involved with  expanding new concepts such as bahama
breeze and smokey bones that have not yet proved their longterm viability the
opening and success of  restaurants  depends on various  factors  including the
identification  and availability of suitable and economically  viable locations
sales levels at existing  restaurants  the  negotiation of acceptable  lease or
purchase terms for new locations  obtaining all required  governmental permits
including  zoning  approvals  and  liquor  licenses  on a timely  basis  other
regulatory   compliance   the   availability   of   necessary   contracts   and
subcontractors  and the ability to meet construction  schedules  our ability to
manage union activities such as picketing  which could delay construction  the
availability  of capital at affordable  cost to finance  growth  changes in the
weather  or other  acts of god that  could  result in  construction  delays  and
adversely  affect the results of one or more  restaurants  for an  indeterminate
amount of time our ability to hire and train  qualified  management  personnel
and general economic and business conditions

     during fiscal 1999 we formed two  subsidiary  corporations  each of which
elected to be taxed as a real estate  investment  trust  reit under sections
856  through  860 of the  internal  revenue  code  these  elections  limit  the
activities  of both  corporations  to holding  certain real estate  assets  the
formation of these two reits is designed  primarily to assist us in managing our
real  estate  portfolio  and  possibly  to provide a vehicle  to access  capital

item 7 managements  discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations

this discussion and analysis below for the company should be read in conjunction
with our consolidated  financial statements and related notes found elsewhere in
this report  all applicable  disclosures in the following  discussion have been
modified to reflect the restatement as described below

for  financial  reporting  we operate on a 5253 week fiscal year ending on the
last sunday in may  our 2004 fiscal year  which ended on may 30 2004  had 53
weeks  our 2003 fiscal year  which ended on may 25 2003  and our 2002 fiscal
year  which ended on may 26 2002  each had 52 weeks we have included in this
discussion  certain financial  information for fiscal 2004 on a 52week basis in
order to assist investors in making comparisons to our prior fiscal years

restatement

following a december 2004 review of the accounting  adjustments cited in several
recent form 8k filings by other restaurant companies  and in consultation with
our independent  registered public accounting firm kpmg llp we determined that
one of the  adjustments  in those  filings  relating to the  treatment  of lease
accounting and leasehold depreciation applied to us and that it was appropriate
to  adjust  certain  of our prior  financial  statements  as a result  we have
restated our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years 1996 through
2004 and for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 historically when accounting for
leases with renewal options  we recorded rent expense on a straightline  basis
over the initial noncancelable lease term with the term commencing when actual
rent payments began  we depreciate our buildings  leasehold  improvements  and
other longlived assets on those properties over a period that includes both the
initial  noncancelable  lease term and all option  periods  provided for in the
lease or the useful life of the assets  if shorter  we  previously  believed
that these longstanding  accounting  treatments were appropriate under generally
accepted accounting principles we now have restated our financial statements to
recognize  rent expense on a  straightline  basis over the expected lease term
including cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would
result in an  economic  penalty  the lease term  commences  on the date when we
become  legally  obligated for the rent  payments  these  adjustments  were not
attributable  to  any  material  noncompliance  by  us  as  a  result  of  any
misconduct with any financial reporting requirements under the securities laws
the restatement is further  discussed in the explanatory  note in the forepart
of this form 10ka and in note 2  restatement of financial  statements under
notes  to  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in item 8  financial
statements and supplementary data of this form 10ka

the cumulative  effect of the restatement  through fiscal 2004 is an increase in
deferred  rent  liability of 114 million and a decrease in deferred  income tax
liability of 44 million  as a result  retained  earnings at the end of fiscal
2004  decreased by 70 million  rent expense for fiscal years ended 2004  2003
and 2002 increased by 7 million 10 million and 8 million respectively the
restatement  decreased  reported diluted net earnings per share by 002  004
and 003 for the fiscal years ended 2004  2003  and 2002  respectively  the
restatement did not have any impact on our previously reported cash flows sales
or samerestaurant sales or on our compliance with any covenant under our credit
facility or other debt instruments

the impact of these  adjustments on the consolidated  statements of earnings for
each of the three  fiscal  years  from 2002  through  2004 is shown in the table
below  further  information  on the nature and impact of these  adjustments  is
provided  in note 2  restatement  of  financial  statements  under  notes  to
consolidated  financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and
supplementary data of this form 10ka

overview of operations

our business  operates in the casual dining segment of the restaurant  industry
primarily in the united states  at may 30 2004 we operated 1325 red lobster
olive  garden  bahama  breeze  smokey bones  barbeque  grill  and seasons 52
restaurants  in the  united  states  and  canada  and  licensed  38 red  lobster
restaurants  in japan  we own and operate all of our  restaurants in the united
states and canada with no franchising

our sales were 500  billion in fiscal 2004 and 465 billion in fiscal 2003 a
75 percent increase on a 52week basis after adjusting for the 90 million of
sales  contributed by the additional  53rd operating week in fiscal 2004  total
sales would have been 491 billion for fiscal 2004 a 55 percent increase from
fiscal 2003  net earnings for fiscal 2004 were 227 million  134 per diluted
share  compared  with net earnings  for fiscal 2003 of 226 million  127 per
diluted  share  net earnings for fiscal 2004 increased 05 percent and diluted
net earnings per share increased 55 percent  compared to fiscal 2003  although
red lobsters string of 23 consecutive  quarters of us  samerestaurant  sales
gains ended during fiscal 2004  red lobster has made progress in some important
areas red lobster improved its operating  efficiency during fiscal 2004 through
improvements  in  labor   management  and  other  cost  controls   as  well  as
implementing a lessdisruptive promotional strategy in the second half of fiscal
2004  which resulted in higher  operating  profit than in fiscal 2003  results
from guest satisfaction surveys also improved as the fiscal year progressed red
lobster  retained a new advertising  agency in fiscal 2004 and is in the process
of  developing a marketing  plan designed to achieve more  sustainable  benefits
than have been  obtained in prior  years  red lobster  also is  developing  new
entree  offerings in the 1015 price range to strengthen  the value offered to
its guests  olive gardens sales gains in fiscal 2004 combined with lower food
and  beverage   costs   restaurant

expenses  and selling  general  and  administrative  expenses as a percent of
sales  more than offset  increased  restaurant  labor  expenses as a percent of
sales  this resulted in a doubledigit  increase in operating  profit for olive
garden during fiscal 2004 along with record annual  operating  profit and return
on sales

in fiscal 2005 we expect to increase our number of restaurants by approximately
50 to 60 restaurants  we expect combined samerestaurant sales growth in fiscal
2005 of between one percent and three  percent for red lobster and olive garden
we believe we can achieve  diluted net earnings per share growth in the range of
8 percent to 12 percent for fiscal 2005  in fiscal 2005  we also expect bahama
breeze to be  accretive  to  earnings  and smokey  bones to remain  dilutive to
earnings  however  we expect  smokey  bones to be accretive to earnings in the
second half of fiscal 2005  as with  samerestaurant  sales  growth  there can
always  be some  quartertoquarter  variability  in  operating  results  where
specific  factors  put us above or  below  the  expected  range of  diluted  net
earnings per share  growth  we believe our strong  balance sheet and cash flows
will be important factors in helping us reach our goals

our  mission is to be the best in casual  dining  now and for  generations  to
achieve  this  goal  we  focus  on  four  strategic   imperatives   leadership
excellence brand management excellence service and hospitality excellence and
culinary and beverage excellence

from a financial perspective we seek to increase sales and profits to evaluate
our  operations and assess our financial  performance  we use the following two
key factors

     o    samerestaurant  sales  a yearoveryear  comparison of each periods
          sales volumes for restaurants that are open more than 16 months and
     o    operating  margins  restaurant  sales less  restaurantlevel  cost of
          sales food and beverage costs restaurant labor and other restaurant
          expenses

increasing  samerestaurant  sales can increase operating  margins  since these
incremental  sales provide better  leverage of our fixed costs  samerestaurant
sales increases can be generated by increases in guest traffic increases in the
average guest check or a combination of the two the average guest check can be
impacted  by menu  price  changes  and by the mix of menu items  sold  for each
concept  we gather  sales data daily and  regularly  analyze the guest  traffic
counts  and the mix of menu  items sold to assist in  developing  menu  pricing
product offerings  and promotional strategies  we view guest traffic counts as
an indication of the longterm  health of a concept  while increases in average
check and menu mix may contribute more significantly to nearterm profitability
we continually  focus on balancing our pricing and product  offerings with other
initiatives to generate sustainable growth in samerestaurant sales

incremental  samerestaurant sales increases make a significant  contribution to
our profitability many restaurantlevel expenses are relatively fixed in nature
and do not vary with sales volumes  therefore  samerestaurant sales increases
can improve our profitability  we define  samerestaurants  as restaurants that
have been open at least 16 months  new  restaurants  experience  an  adjustment
period before sales levels and operating margins  normalize  and sales at newly
opened  restaurants  generally  do  not  make  a  significant   contribution  to
profitability  in their initial months of operation  our sales and expenses can
be  impacted  significantly  by the  number  and  timing of the  opening  of new
restaurants   and  the  closing   relocation   and   remodeling  of  existing
restaurants  preopening expenses each period reflect the costs associated with
opening new restaurants in current and future periods

there are significant  risks and challenges that could impact our operations and
ability to increase sales and earnings the casual dining restaurant industry is
highly  competitive  and sensitive to economic  turns  trends in lifestyles and
fluctuating costs operating margins for our concepts are susceptible to changes
in the price of commodities  including seafood  beef pork  chicken  cheese
produce  natural gas and other energy supplies  other risks and uncertainties
include  the price and  availability  of labor  insurance  and media  possible
unfavorable  publicity  relating  to food safety or other  concerns  government
regulation  and  litigation  and factors  that could  impact our growth  plans
including the availability of suitable restaurant  locations  construction cost
increases construction delays and other factors

sales

sales were 500 billion in fiscal 2004 465 billion in fiscal 2003 and 437
billion in fiscal 2002 the 75 increase in companywide  sales for fiscal 2004
was primarily due to a net increase of 54 companyowned restaurants since fiscal
2003  samerestaurant  sales  increases  at olive  garden  and the  additional
operating week in fiscal 2004  these sales  increases were partially  offset by
decreased  samerestaurant sales at red lobster after adjusting for 90 million
of sales  contributed by the additional  operating week  total sales would have
been 491 billion for fiscal 2004 on a 52week  basis  a 55 percent  increase
from fiscal 2003

red  lobster  sales of 244  billion  were 01  percent  above last year  us

guest counts  average  annual sales per  restaurant  for olive garden were 41
million  in fiscal  2004 on a 52week  basis  olive  garden  has  enjoyed  39
consecutive quarters of us samerestaurant sales increases

breeze  opened  four new  restaurants  during  fiscal  2004  including  its new
prototype   restaurant  in  pittsburgh   pa  bahama  breeze  also  closed  six
restaurants  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  2004  as  a  result  of a

the 66 percent  increase in  companywide  sales for fiscal 2003 versus  fiscal
2002 was primarily due to samerestaurant  sales increases in the us and a net
increase of 60 companyowned restaurants since fiscal 2002 red lobster sales of
243 billion were 41 percent above fiscal 2002 us samerestaurant sales for
red lobster  increased  27  percent  due to a 31  percent  increase in average

counts average annual sales per restaurant for red lobster were 37 million in
fiscal 2003  olive garden sales of 199  billion were 68 percent above fiscal
2002 us samerestaurant sales for olive garden increased 22 percent due to a

garden  were  39  million  in  fiscal  2003  bahama  breeze  opened  five new
restaurants  during fiscal 2003 and generated  sales that exceeded 137 million

costs and expenses

total costs and expenses  were 467  billion in fiscal 2004  432  billion in
fiscal  2003  and 401  billion in fiscal  2002  total costs and  expenses in
fiscal 2004 were 934 percent of sales  an increase  from 927 percent of sales
in fiscal 2003  the  following  analysis of the  components  of total costs and
expenses is presented as a percent of sales

food and  beverage  costs  increased  78 million  or 54  percent  from 145
billion to 153  billion  in fiscal  2004  compared  to fiscal  2003  food and
beverage  costs  increased  65 million  or 47 percent  from 138 billion to
145  billion in fiscal 2003  compared to fiscal  2002  as a percent of sales
food and beverage costs  decreased from the prior year in fiscal 2004 and fiscal
2003  primarily  as a result  of  pricing  changes  and  favorable  changes  in
promotional and menu mix of sales  which was partially offset by higher seafood
costs and by crab  usage and  additional  plate  accompaniments  at red  lobster
during its crab promotion in the first quarter of fiscal 2004  other  commodity
costs such as chicken and shrimp decreased modestly

restaurant labor increased 116 million  or 78 percent  from 149 billion to
160 billion in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 restaurant labor increased
112 million or 81 percent from 137 billion to 149 billion in fiscal 2003
compared to fiscal 2002 as a percent of sales  restaurant  labor  increased in
fiscal  2004  primarily  as a result of a modest  increase  in wage rates at red
lobster and olive garden and higher manager bonuses at olive garden as a result
of their increased operating performance in fiscal 2004 these factors were only
partially  offset by the  favorable  impact of higher  sales  volumes  and lower
health  insurance  costs as a result of fewer  claims  as a  percent  of sales
restaurant  labor  increased  in fiscal 2003  primarily  as a result of a modest
increase in wage rates higher promotional  staffing levels and increased sales
volatility  which made it more  difficult  to  predict  staffing  needs  these
factors  were only  partially  offset by the  favorable  impact of higher  sales
volumes

restaurant  expenses which include lease  property tax credit card  utility
workers  compensation   insurance  new  restaurant  preopening   and  other
restaurantlevel operating expenses increased 61 million or 86 percent from
714 million to 775 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003  restaurant
expenses  increased  77  million  or 121  percent  from 637 million to 714
million  in  fiscal  2003  compared  to  fiscal  2002  as a  percent  of sales
restaurant  expenses  increased in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003  primarily due to
increased  utility   workers   compensation   insurance  and  new  restaurant
preopening  costs  these  cost  increases  were only  partially  offset by the
favorable impact of higher sales volumes

selling  general  and administrative  expenses  increased 40 million  or 94
percent  from 432  million to 472  million in fiscal 2004  compared to fiscal
2003 selling  general  and administrative  expenses increased 15 million or
35 percent from 417 million to 432 million in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal
2002  as a percent of sales  selling  general  and  administrative  expenses
increased in fiscal 2004 primarily due to increased  employee  benefit costs an
increase in the amount contributed to the darden restaurants  inc  foundation
and an increase in litigation related costs which were only partially offset by
the favorable  impact of higher sales volumes  as a percent of sales  selling
general  and administrative  expenses in fiscal 2003 were less than fiscal 2002
primarily  as a result of  decreased  bonus  costs and the  favorable  impact of
higher sales volumes which were partially offset by increased marketing expense
incurred in response to the challenging economic and competitive environment

depreciation and  amortization  expense  increased 19 million  or 98 percent
from 191  million  to 210  million in fiscal  2004  compared  to fiscal  2003
depreciation and amortization  expense  increased 25 million  or 153 percent
from 166 million to 191 million in fiscal 2003  compared to fiscal 2002  as a
percent of sales  depreciation  and  amortization  increased in fiscal 2004 and
2003 primarily as a result of new restaurant and remodel activities  which were
only partially offset by the favorable impact of higher sales volumes

net interest expense increased 1 million  or 25 percent  from 43 million to
44  million in fiscal  2004  compared  to fiscal  2003  net  interest  expense
increased 6 million or 164 percent from 37 million to 43 million in fiscal
2003  compared to fiscal 2002  as a percent of sales  net interest  expense in
fiscal 2004 was comparable to fiscal 2003  reflecting  lower interest income in
fiscal  2004  offset by the  favorable  impact of higher  sales  volumes  as a
percent of sales  net interest  expense in fiscal 2003 was comparable to fiscal
2002 primarily because increased interest expense associated with higher average
debt levels in fiscal 2003 was offset by the  favorable  impact of higher  sales
volumes

after a  comprehensive  analysis  performed  during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004 that  examined  restaurants  not meeting  our minimum  returnoninvestment
thresholds and other operating performance criteria we recorded a 365 million
pretax  224  million  aftertax  charge for  longlived  asset  impairments
associated with the closing of six bahama breeze  restaurants and the writedown
of the carrying value of four other bahama breeze restaurants  one olive garden
restaurant and one red lobster restaurant  which continued to operate we also
recorded a 11 million pretax 07 million  aftertax  restructuring  charge
primarily related to severance payments made to certain restaurant employees and
exit costs  associated  with the closing of the six bahama  breeze  restaurants
during  fiscal 2004  certain  changes were made at bahama breeze to improve its
sales  financial  performance  and overall longterm potential  including the
addition of lunch at most restaurants and introduction of a new dinner menu the
decision to close certain bahama breeze  restaurants and write down the carrying
value of others was based on our ongoing review of each individual restaurants
performance against our expectations and their ability to successfully implement
these changes based on our review of the other 28 bahama breeze restaurants we
believe their locations and ability to execute these and future initiatives will
minimize the likelihood that additional impairment charges will be required the
writedown  of the  carrying  value of one olive garden  restaurant  and one red
lobster restaurant was a result of lessthanoptimal locations we will continue
to evaluate all of our locations to minimize the risk of future asset impairment
charges  in addition to the fiscal 2004 fourth  quarter  action  we recognized
asset  impairment  charges in the  amount of 57  million  and 49  million in
fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively  related to the relocation and rebuilding of
certain restaurants asset impairment credits related to the sale of assets that
were  previously  impaired  amounted to 14  million and 06 million in fiscal
2004 and 2003  respectively  pretax restructuring credits of 04 million and
26 million were  recorded in fiscal 2003 and 2002  respectively  the credits
resulted from lower than  projected  costs of lease  terminations  in connection
with our fiscal 1997 restructuring  all fiscal 1997 restructuring  actions were
completed as of may 25 2003

income taxes

the  effective  income  tax  rates for  fiscal  2004  2003  and 2002 were 317
percent  331  percent  and 345 percent  respectively  the rate decrease in
fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 was primarily a result of favorable  resolutions  of
prior year tax matters and an increase in fica tax credits for employeereported
tips

net earnings and net earnings per share

net  earnings  for  fiscal  2004 were 227  million  134 per  diluted  share
compared  with net earnings  for fiscal 2003 of 226 million  127 per diluted
share and net  earnings  for fiscal  2002 of 233  million  127 per  diluted
share

net earnings for fiscal 2004  increased 05 percent and diluted net earnings per
share  increased  55  percent  compared  to fiscal  2003  the  increase in net
earnings was primarily due to decreases in food and beverage  costs as a percent
of sales  which were only  partially  offset by increases in restaurant  labor
restaurant  expenses   selling   general  and  administrative  expenses  and
depreciation and  amortization  expense as a percent of sales net earnings were
also  impacted  by  the  38  million  pretax  23  million  aftertax  asset
impairment and  restructuring  charges  recognized during fiscal 2004 related to
the  closing of six bahama  breeze  restaurants  and write down of another  four
bahama  breeze  restaurants  one olive  garden  restaurant  and one red lobster
restaurant the increase in diluted net earnings per share is primarily due to a
reduction in the average diluted shares  outstanding  from fiscal 2003 to fiscal
2004 because of our continuing repurchase of our common stock

net earnings for fiscal 2003  decreased 29 percent and diluted net earnings per
share was  comparable to fiscal 2002 the decrease in net earnings was primarily
due to increases in restaurant labor  restaurant expenses and depreciation and
amortization expenses as a percent of sales which were only partially offset by
decreases in food and beverage costs and selling  general  and  administrative
costs as a percent of sales  diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2003 was
comparable  to fiscal 2002 due to a  reduction  in the  average  diluted  shares
outstanding from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 because of our continuing repurchase
of our common stock  which was offset by the decrease in net earnings in fiscal
2003

seasonality

our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally  during fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 our
sales were  highest in the spring  lowest in the fall  and  comparable  during
winter and summer  holidays  severe weather and similar conditions may impact
sales volumes seasonally in some operating  regions  because of the seasonality
of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily  indicative of the
results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year

impact of inflation

we do not believe  inflation had a significant  overall effect on our operations
during fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 we believe we have historically been able to
pass on  increased  operating  costs  through  menu  price  increases  and other
strategies

critical accounting policies

we prepare our consolidated  financial  statements in conformity with accounting
principles  generally accepted in the united states of america  the preparation
of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial  statements  and
the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting  period  actual
results could differ from those estimates

critical accounting policies are those we believe are both most important to the
portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require our most
difficult  subjective  or complex  judgments  often as a result of the need to
make  estimates  about the  effect of  matters  that are  inherently  uncertain
judgments and  uncertainties  affecting the  application  of those  policies may
result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions
or using different  assumptions  we consider the following  policies to be most
critical in  understanding  the  judgments  that are involved in  preparing  our
consolidated financial statements

land buildings and equipment

land   buildings   and  equipment  are  recorded  at  cost  less   accumulated
depreciation  building  components are depreciated  over estimated useful lives
ranging  from  seven to 40  years  using  the  straightline  method  leasehold
improvements  which  are  reflected  on our  consolidated  balance  sheets as a
component of  buildings  are  amortized  over the lesser of the expected  lease
term  including cancelable option periods or the estimated useful lives of the
related assets using the  straightline  method  equipment is depreciated  over
estimated   useful  lives  ranging  from  two  to  10  years   also  using  the
straightline  method  accelerated  depreciation methods are generally used for
income tax purposes


our accounting  policies  regarding land  buildings  and equipment  including
leasehold  improvements  include our judgments  regarding the estimated  useful
lives of these assets  the residual  values to which the assets are depreciated
or amortized  and the determination as to what constitutes  enhancing the value
of or increasing the life of existing assets  these judgments and estimates may
produce materially  different amounts of reported  depreciation and amortization
expense if different  assumptions were used as discussed  further below  these
judgments  may also impact our need to  recognize  an  impairment  charge on the
carrying amount of these assets as the cash flows associated with the assets are
realized

impairment of longlived assets

land buildings  and equipment and certain other assets  including capitalized
software costs and liquor licenses  are reviewed for impairment whenever events
or changes in  circumstances  indicate that the carrying  amount of an asset may
not be recoverable  recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by
a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted net
cash flows expected to be generated by the assets  identifiable  cash flows are
measured at the lowest level for which they are largely  independent of the cash
flows of other groups of assets and  liabilities  generally  at the  restaurant
level if these assets are determined to be impaired  the impairment recognized
is measured  by the amount by which the  carrying  amount of the assets  exceeds
their fair value  fair value is generally  determined  based on  appraisals  or
sales prices of comparable assets  restaurant sites

                                       25
page

and certain  other  assets to be disposed of are  reported at the lower of their
carrying amount or fair value  less estimated costs to sell  restaurant  sites
and  certain  other  assets to be  disposed  of are  included in assets held for
disposal when certain  criteria are met these criteria  include the requirement
that the  likelihood  of disposing of these assets  within one year is probable
those  assets  whose  disposal is not  probable  within one year remain in land
buildings and equipment until their disposal is probable within one year

the judgments we make related to the expected useful lives of longlived  assets
and our  ability to realize  undiscounted  cash flows in excess of the  carrying
amounts of these assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing  maintenance
and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions  and changes in
usage or operating performance as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and
carrying amounts of our longlived assets  significant adverse changes in these
factors could cause us to realize a material  impairment charge in fiscal 2004
we recognized  asset impairment  charges of 37 million 22 million  aftertax
for the closing of six bahama  breeze  restaurants  and the  writedown  of four
other  bahama  breeze  restaurants  one olive  garden  restaurant  and one red
lobster restaurant based on an evaluation of expected cash flows

selfinsurance accruals

we  selfinsure  a  significant  portion of expected  losses  under our workers
compensation   employee  medical  and  general  liability  programs   accrued
liabilities  have been recorded  based on our estimates of the ultimate costs to
settle incurred claims both reported and not yet reported

our accounting policies regarding  selfinsurance programs include our judgments
and  independent  actuarial  assumptions  regarding  economic  conditions   the
frequency  or  severity  of claims  and claim  development  patterns  and claim
reserve  management  and settlement practices  unanticipated changes in these
factors may produce materially different amounts of reported expense under these
programs

income taxes

we  estimate  certain  components  of our  provision  for  income  taxes  these
estimates  include  among other items  depreciation and  amortization  expense
allowable for tax  purposes  allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid
on reported  employee  tip income  effective  rates for state and local  income
taxes and the tax deductibility of certain other items

our estimates are based on the best  available  information  at the time that we
prepare the provision  we generally file our annual income tax returns  several
months  after our fiscal  yearend  income tax  returns are subject to audit by
federal  state  and local  governments  generally years after the returns are
filed  these  returns  could be subject to material  adjustments  or  differing
interpretations of the tax laws

liquidity and capital resources

cash flows  generated  from operating  activities  provide us with a significant
source of  liquidity  since  substantially  all our sales are for cash and cash
equivalents  and accounts  payable are generally due in five to 30 days we are
able to carry current  liabilities in excess of current  assets  in addition to
cash flows from  operations  we use a combination  of longterm and  shortterm
borrowings to fund our capital needs

we manage our business and our financial  ratios to maintain an investment grade
bond rating  which allows  flexible  access to financing at  reasonable  costs
currently  our publicly issued longterm debt carries baa1 moodys investors
service  bbb standard  poors and bbb fitch ratings our commercial
paper has  ratings of p2  moodys  investors  service  a2  standard  
poors  and f2  fitch  these  ratings  are as of the date of this  annual
report and have been  obtained  with the  understanding  that moodys  investors
service  standard  poors  and fitch will  continue to monitor our credit and
make future  adjustments to these ratings to the extent  warranted  the ratings
may be changed superseded or withdrawn at any time

our  commercial  paper  program  serves  as our  primary  source  of  shortterm
financing  at may 30 2004 15 million was outstanding  under the program  to
support our commercial  paper program  we have a credit facility under a credit
agreement  dated  october 17  2003  as amended  with a  consortium  of banks
including  wachovia  bank  na as  administrative  agent  under which we can
borrow up to 400 million  the credit  facility allows us to borrow at interest
rates based on a spread over i libor or ii a base rate that is the higher of
the prime rate  or onehalf of one percent above the federal funds rate at our
option  the interest  rate spread over libor is  determined by our debt rating
the  credit  facility   expires  on  october  17  2008  and  contains  various
restrictive

                                       26
page

covenants  including  a leverage  test that  requires us to maintain a ratio of
consolidated total debt to consolidated  total  capitalization of less than 055
to 100 and a  limitation  of 25 million on priority  debt  subject to certain

net cash flows used in  financing  activities  included our  repurchase  of 107
million shares of our common stock for 235 million in fiscal 2004  compared to
107 million  shares for 213 million in fiscal 2003 and 90 million shares for
209  million  in fiscal  2002  our board of  directors  has  authorized  us to
repurchase  up to 1154 million  shares of our common stock  at may 30 2004 a
total of 1092 million shares have been repurchased under the authorization the
repurchased  common stock is reflected as a reduction of  stockholders  equity
net cash flows used in financing  activities  also  included  dividends  paid to
stockholders of 13 million  14 million  and 9 million in fiscal 2004 2003
and 2002 respectively

net cash  flows  used in  investing  activities  included  capital  expenditures
incurred  principally for building new  restaurants  replacing  equipment  and
remodeling  existing  restaurants  capital  expenditures  were 354  million in
fiscal 2004 compared to 423 million in fiscal 2003 and 318 million in fiscal
2002  the  decreased  expenditures  in  fiscal  2004  resulted  primarily  from
decreased  spending  associated  with building fewer new  restaurants  and fewer
remodels  the increased  expenditures  in fiscal 2003 resulted  primarily  from
increased  spending  associated with building more new restaurants and replacing
equipment   we  estimate  that  our  fiscal  2005  capital   expenditures  will
approximate 360 million

net cash flows  provided by operating  activities for fiscal 2003 included a 20
million  contribution to our defined  benefit  pension plans  which enabled the
plans to  maintain a fully  funded  status as of the plans  february  28  2003
annual  valuation  date less than 01 million was required to fund our defined
benefit  pension plans in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2002  our defined  benefit and
other postretirement  benefit costs and liabilities are calculated using various
actuarial   assumptions  and   methodologies   prescribed  under  the  financial
accounting  standards boards fasb statement of financial accounting standards
sfas no 87  employers  accounting  for pensions and no 106  employers
accounting  for  postretirement  benefits other than  pensions  we use certain
assumptions  including  but not limited to the  selection of a discount  rate
expected  longterm rate of return on plan assets and expected health care cost
trend rates we set the discount rate  assumption  annually for each plan at its
valuation  date  to  reflect  the  yield  of  high  quality   fixedincome  debt
instruments  with lives that approximate the maturity of the plan benefits  at
may 30 2004 our discount rate was 60 percent  the expected longterm rate of
return on plan assets

                                       28

and health care cost trend rates are based upon several  factors  including our
historical  assumptions  compared  with actual  results  an analysis of current
market  conditions  asset  allocations  and the  views  of  leading  financial
advisers and  economists  based on our analysis  during fiscal 2003 we lowered
our defined benefit plans expected  longterm rate of return on plan assets for
fiscal 2004 from 104 percent to 90 percent  the change in our defined benefit
plans  expected  longterm  rate of return on plan  assets  decreased  earnings
before income taxes by approximately 2 million in fiscal 2004 at may 30 2004
our  expected  health  care cost trend rates  ranged  from 110  percent to 120
percent for fiscal 2005  depending on the medical service  category  the rates
gradually  decrease to 50 percent  through fiscal 2010 and remain at that level
thereafter

the  expected  longterm  rate of return  on plan  assets  component  of our net
periodic  benefit cost is calculated based on the  marketrelated  value of plan
assets  our target asset  allocation  is 35 percent us  equities  30 percent
highquality  longduration  fixedincome securities  15 percent international
equities  10 percent private  equities  and 10 percent real assets we monitor
our actual asset allocation to ensure that it approximates our target allocation
and believe that our longterm asset allocation will continue to approximate our
target  allocation  our  historical  tenyear  rate of return  on plan  assets
calculated using the geometric method average of returns  is approximately 105
percent as of may 30 2004

we have an  unrecognized  net actuarial  loss for the defined  benefit plans and
postretirement  benefit plan as of may 30 2004  of 62 million and 6 million
respectively  the  unrecognized  net actuarial loss  represents  changes in the
amount of the  projected  benefit  obligation  and plan  assets  resulting  from
differences in the assumptions used and actual  experience  the amortization of
the  unrecognized  net actuarial  loss component of our fiscal 2005 net periodic
benefit cost for the defined  benefit plans and  postretirement  benefit plan is
expected to be approximately 5 million and 03 million respectively

we believe our defined benefit and  postretirement  benefit plan assumptions are
appropriate based upon the factors discussed above  however  other assumptions
could also be reasonably  applied that could differ from the assumptions used a
quarter  percentage point change in the defined benefit plans discount rate and
the expected  longterm rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease
earnings before income taxes by 08 million and 04 million  respectively  a
quarter percentage point change in our postretirement benefit plan discount rate
would increase or decrease  earnings before income taxes by 01 million  a one
percentage  point  increase  in the  health  care cost  trend  rates  would have
increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo by 4 million
at may 30  2004  and the  aggregate  of the  service  cost and  interest  cost
components  of net  periodic  postretirement  benefit  cost by 03  million for
fiscal 2004 a one percentage point decrease in the health care cost trend rates
would have  decreased the apbo by 3 million at may 30 2004  and the aggregate
of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic  postretirement
benefit cost by 03 million for fiscal 2004 these changes in assumptions would
not significantly impact our funding requirements

we are not aware of any  trends or  events  that  would  materially  affect  our
capital requirements or liquidity we believe that our internal  cashgenerating
capabilities  borrowings  available under our shelf  registration for unsecured
debt securities and shortterm commercial paper program should be sufficient to
finance our capital expenditures  stock repurchase program and other operating
activities through fiscal 2005

offbalance sheet arrangements

we are not a party to any  offbalance  sheet  arrangements  that  have  or are
reasonably  likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial
condition  changes in financial  condition  revenues or  expenses  results of
operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources

financial condition

our  current  assets  totaled  346  million at may 30  2004  compared to 326
million at may 25  2003  the increase  resulted  primarily  from  increases in
inventories of 25 million that resulted from  opportunistic  product  purchases
made during fiscal 2004

our current  liabilities  were 683  million at may 30  2004  compared to 640
million at may 25 2003  at may 30 2004  15 million of  shortterm  debt was
outstanding  under our commercial paper program  which was used to fund current
operations and capital expenditures  accrued payroll of 103 million at may 30
2004  increased  from 86 million at may 25  2003  principally  due to higher
incentive  compensation earned in fiscal 2004 other current liabilities of 228
million  at  may  30  2004  increased  from  202  million  at may  25  2003
principally  due to a 19

                                       29
page

million  increase in  liabilities  associated  with our  nonqualified  deferred
compensation  plan and a 7 million increase in sales tax payable as a result of
higher fourth quarter sales in fiscal 2004  accrued income taxes of 49 million
at may 30 2004 decreased from 68 million at may 25 2003  principally due to
timing of income tax payments made and changes in temporary differences included
in the deferred tax balances  associated  with current income tax deductions for
certain land  buildings  and  equipment  the 19 million  decrease in accrued
income  taxes is offset by the  related  increase  in net  noncurrent  deferred
income tax liabilities at may 30 2004



quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including fluctuations in interest
rates  foreign currency  exchange rates and commodity  prices  to manage this
exposure  we periodically  enter into interest rate foreign currency exchange
and commodity  instruments for other than trading purposes see notes 1 and 8 of
the notes to consolidated financial statements

we use the  variancecovariance  method  to  measure  value at risk  over  time
horizons ranging from one week to one year at the 95 percent  confidence level
at may 30 2004  our  potential  losses in future net earnings  resulting  from
changes in foreign currency  exchange rate instruments  commodity  instruments
and floating rate debt interest rate  exposures  were  approximately  2 million
over a period  of one year  including  the  impact  of the  interest  rate swap
agreements  discussed  in  note  8  to  the  notes  to  consolidated   financial
statements  the value at risk from an increase in the fair value of all of our
longterm  fixed rate debt  over a period of one year  was  approximately  22
million  the fair value of our  longterm  fixed rate debt  during  fiscal 2004
averaged  690  million  with a high of 714 million and a low of 669 million
our interest rate risk  management  objective is to limit the impact of interest
rate  changes on earnings  and cash flows by  targeting  an  appropriate  mix of
variable and fixed rate debt

strategy

     the  restaurant  industry is generally  considered  to be comprised of four
segments quick service  midscale  casual dining and fine dining the industry
is highly  fragmented and includes many independent  operators and small chains
we  believe  that  capable  operators  of strong  multiunit  concepts  have the
opportunity  to increase  their share of the casual dining  segment  we plan to
grow by increasing the number of  restaurants  in each of our existing  concepts
and by  developing  or  acquiring  additional  concepts  that  can  be  expanded
profitably

     while we are a leader in the casual  dining  segment  we know we cannot be
successful  without a clear sense of who we are our core purpose is to nourish
and  delight  everyone we serve  this core  purpose is  supported  by our core
values

          o    integrity and fairness
          o    respect and caring
          o    diversity
          o    always learningalways teaching
          o    being of service
          o    teamwork and
          o    excellence

     our mission is to be the best in casual dining  now and for generations
four strategic imperatives support our mission

          o    leadership excellence at all levels
          o    brand building excellence
          o    service and hospitality excellence and
          o    culinary and beverage excellence

     we also have two  strategic  enablers  we  believe  can help us  accelerate
progress in each strategic imperative these enablers are

          o    diversity   excellence   that   embraces   and  builds  upon  our
               differences and
          o    process and technology  excellence  that maximize  organizational
               effectiveness and drive both discipline and nimbleness

     new to our strategic framework is the explicit statement of two points that
have been  implicit in our approach to the business for many years now and that
we believe separate us from our competition we are committed to

          o    being a multibrand  restaurant company that is bound together by
               common operating practices and a unifying culture which serves to
               make us stronger than the sum of our parts and
          o    listening  to our guests and  employees  for  insights we need to
               create  powerful   broadly   appealing  brands  and  to  develop
               successful people

bahama breeze

     bahama  breeze  is a  caribbeanthemed  restaurant  that  offers  guests  a
distinctive island dining experience the first bahama breeze opened in 1996 and
met with strong positive consumer response  we continued to test the concept by
opening a limited  number of  additional  restaurants  in each of the  following
years  and  began  national  expansion  of the  concept  in 1998  the  concept
continues to be well received by guests  although its financial performance has
not met our overall expectations bahama breeze closed six restaurants and wrote
down the carrying value of four others during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004
reducing to 32 the total  number of  restaurants  in  operation  in addition to
closing the underperforming  restaurants  we have made recent changes that have
improved the sales  financial  performance  and  longterm  potential of bahama
breeze  these changes include  implementing  lunch  operations  creating a new
dinner menu and slowing new  restaurant  development  we also are  reducing the
size of a typical bahama breeze building and the related capital  investment  a
new  reducedinvestment  prototype building opened in pittsburgh  pa during the
fourth  quarter of fiscal 2004 and the early  results are  encouraging  we have
postponed  any new  restaurant  expansion at bahama breeze while we evaluate the
new prototype in the meantime the closure of some underperforming  restaurants
during  fiscal  2004  allows  bahama  breeze  to focus  on its  most  profitable
restaurants as it builds its business

smokey bones

     smokey bones features  barbequed pork  beef and chicken  as well as other
grilled favorites all served in a lively yet comfortable mountainlodge setting

has been well received by consumers and continues to expand  rapidly  we opened
30 new smokey bones  restaurants  during fiscal 2004  and had 69 restaurants in
operation  at the end of the  fiscal  year  we plan to open 30 to 40 new smokey
bones

restaurants  in fiscal 2005  we believe that smokey bones has strong  expansion
potential  and is capable of  achieving  future  annual sales of 500 million or
more

recent and planned growth

     during fiscal 2004 we opened 66 new restaurants  excluding the relocation
of  existing  restaurants  to new sites and the  rebuilding  of  restaurants  at
existing  sites  and  closed  eight  restaurants  in  addition  we  had  four
restaurants  closed  temporarily  at the end of  fiscal  2004  that we expect to
reopen during fiscal 2005  this resulted in a net increase of 54 restaurants in
fiscal 2004 we plan to open approximately 4965 new red lobster  olive garden
smokey  bones  and  seasons  52  restaurants   during  fiscal  2005   excluding
relocations  and  rebuilds  our actual and  projected  new openings by concept

     our objective is to continue to expand our current  portfolio of restaurant
concepts  and to develop or acquire  additional  concepts  that can be expanded
profitably  we have  continued  to test new  ideas  and  concepts  and also to
evaluate potential  acquisition  candidates to assess whether they would satisfy
our strategic and financial  objectives  at present we have not identified any
specific acquisitions

     in fiscal 2005 we will limit new restaurant expansion at red lobster while
we continue to focus on improving operational returns for that concept at olive
garden  we will  continue  to  focus on  maintaining  operational  returns  and
expanding  that  concept to high  potential  sites that we believe can  generate
significant  returns on our investments  olive gardens  expansion will include
its  recently   developed  tuscan   farmhouse  design  an  outgrowth  of  our
collaboration with rocca delle macie a familyowned  winery in tuscany  italy
we have postponed any new restaurant openings at bahama breeze while we evaluate
the new reducedinvestment  prototype restaurant opened in pittsburgh pa during
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we plan to continue to expand smokey bones in
fiscal 2005 at a pace that we believe will enable each new restaurant to capture
the concepts full potential we plan to open two to three additional seasons 52
restaurants  in fiscal 2005 to further  explore  the  concepts  viability  the
actual  number of openings for each of our concepts will depend on many factors
including our ability to locate appropriate sites negotiate acceptable purchase
or  lease  terms   obtain  necessary  local  governmental   permits   complete
construction and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel

     we consider  location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurants
longterm  success  and we  devote  significant  effort  to the site  selection
process  prior to entering a market  we conduct a thorough  study to determine
the optimal  number and placement of  restaurants  our site  selection  process
incorporates a variety of analytical  techniques to evaluate key factors  these
factors include trade area  demographics  such as target population density and
household  income levels  competitive  influences in the trade area the sites
visibility  accessibility and traffic volume and proximity to activity centers
such as shopping malls hotelmotel complexes offices and universities members
of senior management evaluate inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to
its acquisition  constructing and opening a new restaurant  typically takes 120
to 180 days after permits are obtained and the site is acquired

     the following table illustrates the approximate average capital investment
size and dining capacity of the nine red lobster  23 olive garden and 30 smokey
bones  restaurants  that were opened during fiscal 2004 excluding  relocations
rebuilds and conversions of existing restaurants

     we systematically  review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that
each one meets our standards  when a restaurant falls below minimum  standards
we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes and implement  marketing
and operational plans to improve that restaurants  performance  if performance
does  not  improve  to  acceptable  levels  the  restaurant  is  evaluated  for
relocation closing or conversion to one of our other concepts

     during fiscal 2004 we permanently closed two and relocated ten red lobster
restaurants  during the same period  we relocated one olive garden  restaurant
and permanently closed our one remaining olive garden cafe in addition  during
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we closed six bahama breeze  restaurants  and
wrote down the carrying value of four other bahama breeze restaurants one olive
garden restaurant  and one red lobster restaurant  which continued to operate
the decision to close or write down the carrying  value of the  restaurants  was
the result of our ongoing  analysis that examines  restaurants  not meeting our
minimum return on investment  thresholds and certain other operating performance
criteria  the decision to close and writedown the carrying value of the bahama
breeze  restaurants also reflected an analysis of each  restaurants  ability to
successfully implement the changes effected over the past year to improve sales
financial performance and overall longterm potential of the concept including
the addition of lunch and adoption of a new dinner menu  the  writedown of the
carrying value of the one olive garden restaurant and one red lobster restaurant
was a result of  lessthanoptimal  locations  we continue to evaluate our site
locations in order to minimize the risk of future asset impairment charges

restaurant operations

     we believe  that  highquality  restaurant  management  is  critical to our
longterm  success  we  also  believe  that  our  leadership  position  strong
successoriented   culture  and  various  shortterm  and  longterm   incentive
programs including stock options restricted stock or stock units help attract
and retain highly motivated restaurant managers

     our restaurant  management structure varies by concept and restaurant size
each  restaurant  is led by a  general  manager  and  three  to five  additional
managers  depending  on  the  operating  complexity  and  sales  volume  of the
restaurant  each  restaurant  also  employs  approximately  65  to  140  hourly
employees  most of whom work parttime  we issue detailed  operations  manuals
covering  all aspects of  restaurant  operations  as well as food and  beverage
manuals which detail the preparation  procedures of our formulated recipes  the
restaurant management teams are responsible for the daytoday operation of each
restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards  at our two
largest  concepts  red lobster and olive garden  restaurant  general  managers
report to directors each director was responsible for five to 11 restaurants at
the end of fiscal 2004  compared to our target range of seven to 12 restaurants
for  each  director   restaurants  are  visited  regularly  by  all  levels  of
supervision to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards

     each concepts vice president or director of training together with senior
operations  executives  is  responsible  for developing  and  maintaining  that
concepts  operations  training programs  these efforts include a 12

                                       7

to 15week training program for management trainees  and continuing development
programs for managers  supervisors and directors  the emphasis of the training
and development  programs varies by restaurant concept but includes leadership
restaurant  business  management  and  culinary  skills  we also  use a  highly
structured  training  program  to  open  new  restaurants  including  deploying
training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations  the opening
training teams  typically begin work one week prior to opening and remain at the
new  restaurant  one  week  following  the  opening  they  are  redeployed  as
appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurants operating staff

quality assurance

     our total  quality  department  helps ensure that all  restaurants  provide
safe  highquality  food in a clean  and  safe  environment  through  rigorous
physical  evaluation and testing at our north american  laboratories and through
point source  inspection by our international  team of quality  specialists in
several  foreign  countries  we purchase only seafood that meets or exceeds our
specifications  we use  independent  third  parties  to  inspect  and  evaluate
commodity  vendors  in addition  any commodity  supplier that produces a high
risk  product is subject to a minimum  annual food safety  evaluation by darden
personnel  we require our suppliers to maintain sound  manufacturing  practices
and operate with the comprehensive haccp food safety programs in place

     since 1976 we have  maintained a  microbiological  laboratory to routinely
test seafood and other  commodities for quality and  microbiological  safety in
addition  darden total  quality  managers and third party  auditors  visit each
restaurant  periodically  throughout  the year to review  food  handling  and to
provide education and training in food safety and sanitation  the total quality
managers  also serve as a liaison to regulatory  agencies on issues  relating to
food safety

purchasing and distribution

     our ability to ensure a consistent supply of highquality food and supplies
at competitive prices to all of our restaurant concepts depends upon procurement
from reliable  sources  our purchasing staff sources  negotiates and purchases
food and supplies from more than 2000 suppliers in 45 countries suppliers must
meet strict quality control  standards in the  development  harvest  catch and
production of food products competitive bids longterm contracts and longterm
vendor  relationships  are  routinely  used to manage  availability  and cost of
products

     we believe  that our  seafood  purchasing  capabilities  are a  significant
competitive advantage  our purchasing staff travels routinely within the united
states and  internationally  to source more than 100  varieties  of  topquality
seafood at competitive  prices  we believe that we have  established  excellent
longterm relationships with key seafood vendors and usually source our product
directly from  producers  not brokers or  middlemen  we operate a procurement
office in singapore  our only purchasing  office outside of orlando  to source
products  directly  from asia  while the supply of certain  seafood  species is
volatile  we believe that we have the ability to identify  alternative  seafood
products and to adjust our menus as necessary all other essential food products
are  available  or can be made available  upon short notice  from  alternative
qualified suppliers because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food
products inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in
relation to sales  controlled inventories of specified products are distributed
to all restaurants through independent national distribution companies

     our  supplier  diversity  program  is an  integral  part of our  purchasing
efforts  through it we identify  minority and  womenowned  vendors and assist
them in  establishing  supplier  relationships  with us we are committed to the
development  and growth of minority and womenowned  enterprises  and in fiscal
2004 we spent  more than five  percent  and one  percent  respectively  of our
purchasing dollars with those firms

advertising and marketing

     we believe that we have  developed  significant  marketing and  advertising
capabilities  our size  enables  us to be a leading  advertiser  in the  casual
dining segment of the restaurant industry red lobster and olive garden leverage
the efficiency of national network television advertising and supplement it with
local television advertising bahama breeze and smokey bones do not use national
television advertising  our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers
and we use advertising and product promotions to attract customers we implement
periodic

                                       8

promotions  as  appropriate  to maintain and increase our sales and profits  we
also rely on radio and  newspaper  advertising  as well as newspaper and direct
mail couponing programs as appropriate to attract customers we have developed
and consistently use sophisticated  consumer  marketing  research  techniques to
monitor customer satisfaction and evolving expectations

employees

     at the end of fiscal 2004 we employed  approximately  141300 persons  of
these  employees  approximately  1300 were  corporate  or  restaurant  concept
personnel  located  in  our  restaurant  support  center  in  orlando  florida
approximately 5820 were restaurant  management  personnel in the restaurants or
in field offices  and the remainder were hourly  restaurant  personnel  of the
restaurant  support center  employees  approximately 60 percent were management
personnel and the balance were administrative or office employees our operating
executives  have an  average  of more than 14 years of  experience  with us the
restaurant general managers average 12 years with us we believe that we provide
working  conditions and  compensation  that compare  favorably with those of our
competitors  most  employees  other than  restaurant  management and corporate
management  are paid on an hourly basis none of our employees are covered by a
collective bargaining agreement we consider our employee relations to be good

information technology

     we strive for leadership in the restaurant  business by using technology as
a competitive  advantage and as an enabler for our  strategic  building  blocks
since 1975 computers located in the restaurants have been used to assist in the
management of the restaurants  we have implemented systems targeted at improved
financial control cost management enhanced guest service and improved employee
effectiveness  management  information  systems are  designed to be used across
restaurant  concepts  yet are flexible  enough to meet the unique needs of each
restaurant  concept  in the past three years  we have  implemented  a suite of
webenabled and fully integrated financial and human resource including payroll
and benefits systems  we also implemented a highspeed data network connecting
all restaurants to all current and anticipated future applications

     restaurant  hardware and software  support is provided or coordinated  from
the restaurant support center in orlando florida seven days a week 24 hours a
day a communications  network sends and receives  critical business data to and
from  the  restaurants  throughout  the  day and  night  providing  timely  and
extensive  information on business  activity in every  location  the restaurant
support center houses our data center which contains sufficient computing power
to  process  information  from all  restaurants  quickly  and  efficiently  our
information  is  processed in a secured  environment  to protect both the actual
data  and the  physical  assets  we  guard  against  business  interruption  by
maintaining a disaster  recovery plan which includes storing critical  business
information offsite  testing the disaster recovery plan at a hotsite facility
and  providing  onsite  power  backup  via a  large  diesel  generator  we use
internally developed proprietary  software as well as purchased software  with
proven nonproprietary hardware this allows processing power to be distributed
effectively to each of our restaurants

     our  management   believes  that  our  current   systems  and  practice  of
implementing  regular updates will position us well to support current needs and
future growth we are committed to maintaining an industry  leadership  position
in information systems and computing technology  we use a strategic information
systems planning process that involves senior  management and is integrated into
our overall  business  planning  information  systems  projects are prioritized
based  upon  strategic  financial  regulatory  and  other  business  advantage
criteria

competition

     the restaurant  industry is intensely  competitive with respect to the type
and quality of food price service  restaurant location  personnel  concept
attractiveness  of facilities  and  effectiveness of advertising and marketing
the  restaurant  business  is often  affected  by  changes in  consumer  tastes
national  regional or local economic  conditions  demographic trends  traffic
patterns the type number and location of competing restaurants and consumers
discretionary  purchasing power we compete within each market with national and
regional  chains and  locallyowned  restaurants  for customers  management and
hourly   personnel  and  suitable  real  estate  sites  we  also  face  growing
competition from the supermarket  industry  which offers  convenient meals in
the form of improved  entrees and side dishes from the deli  section  we expect
intense competition to continue in all of these areas

bahama  breezer  smokey  bones  barbeque  grillsm and seasons  52sm  service
marks and other variations of these service marks as having  significant value
and as being  important in marketing  the  restaurants  our policy is to pursue
registration  of our  important  service  marks  and  trademarks  and to  oppose
vigorously any infringement of them  generally  with  appropriate  renewal and
use the registration of our service marks will continue indefinitely

     our only restaurant  operations outside of north america  historically have
been  conducted  through an area  development  and franchise  agreement with red
lobster  japan  co  ltd  red  lobster  japan  an  unaffiliated  japanese
corporation  red lobster japan operated 38 red lobster  restaurants in japan as
of may 30 2004 we do not have an ownership  interest in red lobster japan but
receive royalty income under the franchise agreement  the amount of this income
is not material to our consolidated financial statements

seasonality

     our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally  during fiscal years 2004 2003 and
2002  our sales were highest in the spring  lowest in the fall and comparable
during winter and summer  holidays  severe weather and similar  conditions may
impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions

government regulation

     we are  subject to various  federal  state and local  laws  affecting  our
business  each of our restaurants  must comply with licensing  requirements and
regulations  by a number of  governmental  authorities  which  include  health
safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is
located  the development  and operation of restaurants  depend on selecting and
acquiring suitable sites which are subject to zoning land use  environmental
traffic and other regulations  to date we have not been significantly affected
by any difficulty delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals

     presently  about 93 percent of our sales are  attributable  to the sale of
alcoholic beverages  regulations governing their sale require licensure by each
site in most  cases  on an annual  basis  and  licenses  may be  revoked  or
suspended  for cause at any time  these  regulations  relate to many aspects of
restaurant operation  including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours
of operation advertising wholesale purchasing inventory control and handling
and storage and dispensing of alcoholic  beverages  the failure of a restaurant
to obtain or retain  these  licenses  would  adversely  affect the  restaurants
operations we also are subject in certain states to dramshop statutes which
generally  provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment  that
serves alcoholic  beverages to an intoxicated  person who then causes injury to
himself or a third  party  we carry  liquor  liability  coverage as part of our
comprehensive general liability insurance

     we also are subject to federal and state  minimum  wage laws and other laws
governing  such matters as overtime  tip credits  working  conditions  safety
standards  and hiring and  employment  practices  changes in these laws during
fiscal 2004 have not had a material effect on our operations

     we currently are operating under a tip rate alternative commitment trac
agreement with the internal revenue service  through increased  educational and
other efforts in the restaurants  the trac agreement  reduces the likelihood of
potential chainwide employeronly fica assessments for unreported tips

     we are subject to federal and state  environmental  regulations  but these
rules have not had a material  effect on our  operations  during  fiscal  2004
there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities
and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated

uncertainties  that could  cause our actual  results to differ  materially  from
those  projected  in  forwardlooking  statements  made by us or on our behalf

     the following  factors  risks and  uncertainties  have affected  and may
continue to affect  our operating  results and the environment  within which we
conduct our  business  if our  projections  and estimates  regarding  these key
factors differ  materially from what actually  occurs  our actual results could
vary  significantly  from  the  performance  projected  in  our  forwardlooking
statements

     competition  the  casual  dining  sector  of the  restaurant  industry  is
intensely competitive in pricing  service  location  personnel  and type and
quality of food  we compete with  national  regional  and local  organizations
primarily  through the quality  variety and value perception of menu items the
number and location of restaurants  type of concept  quality and efficiency of
service  attractiveness  of facilities and  effectiveness  of  advertising  and
marketing  programs  are also  important  factors  we  anticipate  that intense
competition will continue in all of these areas

     economic  market and other  conditions  certain  risks are endemic to the
restaurant and retail  industry in general  a protracted  economic  slowdown or
worsening economy  industrywide  cost pressures  or public safety conditions
including  ongoing  concerns about  terrorism  threats or the  continuing  armed
conflict in iraq  could affect  consumer  behavior and spending for  restaurant
dining occasions and lead to  samerestaurant  sales declines and lower profits
the casual  dining sector of the  restaurant  industry is affected by changes in
national  regional  and  local  economic  conditions  the  seasonality  of our
business  consumer  preferences  including  changes in consumer tastes and the
level of consumer  acceptance  of our  restaurant  concepts  consumer  spending
patterns  demographic trends  weather  traffic patterns and the type number
and location of competing  restaurants  our ability to undertake new restaurant
development  as well as improvements and additions to existing restaurants  is
affected  by economic  conditions  including  interest  rates  and  government
policies  impacting land and construction costs and the cost and availability of
borrowed funds

     price and  availability  of food  labor  utilities  insurance and media
other  costs  our  profitability   depends  significantly  on  our  ability  to
anticipate and react to changes in the price and  availability  of food  labor
utilities  insurance  including  workers  compensation   general  liability
health and directors and officers liability insurance advertising media and
marketing  employee  benefits  and other  costs over which we may have  little
control  the price and  availability  of  commodities  including  among other
things shrimp  lobster crab and other seafood are subject to fluctuation and
could  increase or decrease more than we expect  tariffs on imported  shrimp or
other  commodities  could  increase our costs and possibly  impact the supply of
those  goods  we are  subject to the general  risk of  inflation  and  possible
shortages  or  interruptions  in supply  caused by  inclement  weather  or other
conditions that could adversely affect the availability and cost of the items we
buy  restaurant  preopening  expenses could be more than  expected  and labor
shortages  increased  employee turnover and higher minimum wage rates all could
raise our cost of doing  business  our business  also is subject to the risk of
litigation by employees consumers  suppliers  shareholders or others that may
result in additional  costs  there can be no assurance that  management will be
able to  anticipate  and react to these cost issues  without a material  adverse
effect on our profitability and results of operations

     unfavorable publicity relating to food safety or other concerns multiunit
restaurant  businesses  can be adversely  affected by publicity  resulting  from
complaints  or  litigation  alleging  poor  food  quality  foodborne  illness
personal injury  adverse health effects including obesity or other operational
concerns  negative  publicity may also result from actual or alleged violations
of dram shop laws that may impose  liability  on sellers of liquors when a third
party  is  injured  as a result  of  intoxication  regardless  of  whether  the
allegations are valid  unfavorable  publicity relating to just one or a limited
number of restaurants  could taint public  perception of the entire brand  such
unfavorable publicity and overall consumer perceptions of food safety could have
a material adverse effect on our business

     importance of locations  the success of our  restaurants  depends in large
part on location there can be no assurance that current locations will continue
to  be  attractive   as  demographic  patterns  change  possible  declines  in
neighborhoods where restaurants are located or economic conditions  surrounding
those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations

     government  regulation and litigation  we are subject to various  federal
state and local laws affecting our business  the  development  and operation of
restaurants  depend to a significant  extent on the selection and acquisition of
suitable sites which are subject to zoning  land use  environmental  traffic
and other regulations  restaurant  operations are also subject to licensing and
regulation by state and local departments  relating to health  liquor licenses
sanitation  and safety  standards  federal and state labor laws  including the
fair labor  standards act and applicable  minimum wage  requirements  overtime
working and safety conditions and citizenship requirements  federal and state
laws which  prohibit  discrimination  and other laws  regulating  the design and
operation of facilities such as the americans with disabilities act of 1990 we
cannot predict the effect on our operations of these laws and  regulations  the
future enactment of additional  legislation regulating these and other areas or
actual or potential  litigation in  connection  with current and future laws and
regulations

     growth plans there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our
growth objectives or that new restaurants opened or acquired will be profitable
there are inherent  risks  involved with  expanding new concepts such as bahama
breeze and smokey bones that have not yet proved their longterm viability the
opening and success of  restaurants  depends on various  factors  including the
identification  and availability of suitable and economically  viable locations
sales levels at existing  restaurants  the  negotiation of acceptable  lease or
purchase terms for new locations  obtaining all required  governmental permits
including  zoning  approvals  and  liquor  licenses  on a timely  basis  other
regulatory   compliance   the   availability   of   necessary   contracts   and
subcontractors  and the ability to meet construction  schedules  our ability to
manage union activities such as picketing  which could delay construction  the
availability  of capital at affordable  cost to finance  growth  changes in the
weather  or other  acts of god that  could  result in  construction  delays  and
adversely  affect the results of one or more  restaurants  for an  indeterminate
amount of time our ability to hire and train  qualified  management  personnel
and general economic and business conditions

     during fiscal 1999 we formed two  subsidiary  corporations  each of which
elected to be taxed as a real estate  investment  trust  reit under sections
856  through  860 of the  internal  revenue  code  these  elections  limit  the
activities  of both  corporations  to holding  certain real estate  assets  the
formation of these two reits is designed  primarily to assist us in managing our
real  estate  portfolio  and  possibly  to provide a vehicle  to access  capital
markets in the future

     both reits are  nonpublic  reits  through our  subsidiary  companies  we
indirectly  own 100 percent of all voting stock and greater than 995 percent of
the total value of each reit for financial reporting  purposes  both reits are
included in our consolidated financial statements

     we own or  lease  our  executive  offices  culinary  center  and  training
facilities in orlando  florida  except in limited  instances  our  restaurant
sites and other facilities are not subject to mortgages or encumbrances securing
money  borrowed by us from outside  sources  in our opinion  our buildings and

adequate  for  our  current  and  foreseeable  needs  see  also  note 4  land

item 3  legal proceedings

     in march  2003 and march  2002  three of our  current  and  former  hourly
restaurant  employees filed two purported  class action  lawsuits  against us in
california  superior  court of orange county  alleging  violations of california
labor laws with respect to providing  meal and rest  breaks  the lawsuits  seek
penalties under department of labor rules providing a 100 penalty per violation
per  employee  plus  attorneys  fees on  behalf  of the  plaintiffs  and other
purported class members  discovery is currently underway in these matters  one
of the cases was removed to our  mandatory  arbitration  program  although  the
court retained the authority to permit a sample of classwide discovery  we are
prosecuting  an  appeal  to cause  the other  case to be  similarly  removed  to
arbitration in september 2003 three former employees in washington state filed
a similar  purported class action in washington  state superior court in spokane
county  alleging  violations of washington  labor laws with respect to providing
rest breaks  the court stayed the action  and ordered the plaintiffs  into our
mandatory   arbitration   program  the  plaintiffs

have  filed a motion for  reconsideration  we intend to  vigorously  defend our
position in all of these  cases  although  the  outcome of the cases  cannot be

either individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on
our financial position results of operations or liquidity

lawsuits  proceedings  and  claims  may  exist at any given  time  we could be
affected by adverse publicity resulting from the allegations comprising a claim
regardless  of whether the  allegations  are valid or whether we are  ultimately
found  liable  from time to time  we also are involved in lawsuits  related to
infringement  of or challenges to our  trademarks  we do not believe that the
final disposition of the lawsuits and claims in which we are currently  involved
will have a  material  adverse  effect on our  financial  position  results  of

strategy

     the  restaurant  industry is generally  considered  to be comprised of four
segments quick service  midscale  casual dining and fine dining the industry
is highly  fragmented and includes many independent  operators and small chains
we  believe  that  capable  operators  of strong  multiunit  concepts  have the
opportunity  to increase  their share of the casual dining  segment  we plan to
grow by increasing the number of  restaurants  in each of our existing  concepts
and by  developing  or  acquiring  additional  concepts  that  can  be  expanded
profitably

     while we are a leader in the casual  dining  segment  we know we cannot be
successful  without a clear sense of who we are our core purpose is to nourish
and  delight  everyone we serve  this core  purpose is  supported  by our core
values

     o integrity and fairness
     o respect and caring
     o diversity
     o always learningalways teaching
     o being of service
     o teamwork and
     o excellence

     our mission is to be the best in casual dining  now and for generations
three strategic imperatives or building blocks support our mission

     o leadership development as a core competency
     o service and hospitality excellence and
     o culinary and beverage excellence

     these strategic imperatives are supported by three key enablers

     o brand management skills
     o diversity competency and
     o technology solutions

     continuing focus on our three building blocks  supported by our commitment
to brand management  diversity and technology provides a strong foundation for

sales  at  bahama  breeze   surpassed  137  million  and  we  opened  five  new
restaurants  bringing the total to 34 restaurants  the concept continues to be
well  received by guests  although its  financial  performance  has not met our
overall expectations  and we are making changes that we anticipate will improve
its sales financial performance and longterm potential  these changes include
testing lunch operations  creating a new dinner menu and slowing new restaurant
development we plan to open four new bahama breeze  restaurants in fiscal 2004
while  reducing  the size of the building  and the related  capital  investment
however  these  actions  are still in the test  phase and  results  will not be
available  until late in fiscal 2004  we expect bahama breeze to continue to be
dilutive to earnings in fiscal 2004

smokey bones

     smokey bones features  barbequed pork  beef and chicken  as well as other
authentic  americanstyle  favorites  all served in a casual and inviting lodge
setting that includes sports viewing on televisions  we opened the first smokey
bones in september  1999 and began national  expansion of the concept in fiscal
2002  sales  for  smokey  bones  were 93  million  in fiscal  2003  there are
currently 39 smokey bones  restaurants  and we plan to open 25 to 30 new smokey
bones  restaurants  in fiscal  2004  we believe  that  smokey  bones has strong
expansion  potential and is capable of achieving future sales of 500 million or
more

recent and planned growth

     during fiscal 2003 we opened 65 new restaurants  excluding the relocation
of  existing  restaurants  to new sites and the  rebuilding  of  restaurants  at
existing sites and closed four restaurants  this resulted in a net increase of
61 restaurants  in fiscal 2003  assuming the reopening of one restaurant  that
was  temporarily  closed  as of  the  end of  fiscal  2003  we  plan  to  open
approximately 57 to 71 new red lobster  olive garden  bahama breeze and smokey
bones restaurants during fiscal 2004 excluding  relocations and rebuilds  our
actual  and  projected  new  openings  by  concept  excluding  relocations  and
rebuilds are shown below

     our objective is to continue to expand our current  portfolio of restaurant
concepts  and to develop or acquire  additional  concepts  that can be expanded
profitably  we are  currently  testing new ideas and  concepts  and  expanding
bahama  breeze  and  smokey  bones  nationally  in light of  favorable  consumer
response  we also evaluate potential  acquisition  candidates to assess whether
they would satisfy our strategic and financial  objectives  at present we have
not identified any specific acquisitions

     we will continue to focus on improving  operational returns at olive garden
and red lobster  and will limit new  restaurant  expansion of those concepts to
high  potential  sites that we believe can generate  significant  returns on our
investments  olive  gardens  expansion  will  include its  recently  developed
tuscan  farmhouse  design an outgrowth of our collaboration  with rocca delle
macie a familyowned winery in tuscany  italy in addition  we plan to expand
bahama  breeze and smokey  bones at a pace that we believe  will enable each new
restaurant  to capture the  concepts  full  potential  the specific  number of
openings  will  depend  on many  factors  such as the  success  of the  changes
discussed  above at bahama  breeze  in addition to in general  our ability to
locate appropriate sites  negotiate  acceptable purchase or lease terms obtain
necessary local  governmental  permits  complete  construction  and recruit and
train restaurant management and hourly personnel

     we consider  location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurants
longterm  success  and we  devote  significant  effort  to the site  selection
process  prior to entering a market  we conduct a thorough  study to determine
the optimal  number and placement of  restaurants  our site  selection  process
incorporates a variety of analytical  techniques to evaluate key factors  these
factors include trade area  demographics  such as target population density and
household  income levels  competitive  influences in the trade area the sites
visibility  accessibility and traffic volume and proximity to activity centers
such as shopping malls hotelmotel complexes offices and universities members
of senior management evaluate inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to
its acquisition  constructing and opening a new restaurant  typically takes 120
to 180 days after the site is acquired and permits are obtained

     for bahama  breeze  we are in the  process  of  designing  a new  building
prototype with a lower capital investment and a simpler design that we expect to
use for the first time in fiscal 2004 for smokey bones we continue to seek out
sites  where  existing  buildings  can be  converted  to smokey  bones  and are
locating new units in prime casual dining trade areas that we believe will allow
us to realize  greater rates of return on investment  than were  generated  from
certain early sites in less desirable locations

     we systematically  review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that
each one meets our standards  when a restaurant falls below minimum  standards
we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes and implement  marketing
and operational plans to improve that restaurants  performance  if performance
does  not  improve  to  acceptable  levels  the  restaurant  is  evaluated  for
relocation closing or conversion to one of our other concepts

     during  fiscal 2003  we  permanently  closed four and  relocated  five red
lobster  restaurants in the united states  during the same period we relocated
three olive garden restaurants in the united states

restaurant operations

     we believe  that  highquality  restaurant  management  is  critical to our
longterm  success  we  also  believe  that  our  leadership  position  strong
successoriented   culture  and  various  shortterm  and  longterm   incentive
programs  including stock options and restricted stock help attract and retain
highly motivated restaurant managers

     our restaurant  management structure varies by concept and restaurant size
each restaurant is led by a general manager and one to four additional managers
depending on the operating  complexity and sales volume of the restaurant  each
restaurant also employs  approximately 65 to 140 hourly employees  most of whom
work parttime  we issue detailed  operations  manuals  covering all aspects of
restaurant  operations  as well as food and beverage  manuals  which detail the
preparation  procedures of our formulated  recipes  the  restaurant  management
teams are  responsible  for the daytoday  operation of each restaurant and for
ensuring compliance with our operating  standards  at our two largest concepts
red lobster and olive garden  restaurant  general managers report to directors
and each director is responsible  for seven to 14  restaurants  restaurants are
visited  regularly by all levels of supervision to help ensure strict  adherence
to all aspects of our standards

     each concepts vice president or director of training together with senior
operations  executives  is  responsible  for developing  and  maintaining  that
concepts  operations  training programs  these efforts include a 12to 15week
training program for management  trainees  and continuing  development programs
for  managers  supervisors  and  directors  the  emphasis of the  training and
development  programs  varies by restaurant  concept  but includes  leadership
restaurant  business  management  and  culinary  skills  we also  use a  highly
structured  training  program  to  open  new  restaurants  including  deploying
training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations  the opening
training teams  typically begin work one week prior to opening and remain at the
new  restaurant  one  week  following  the  opening   they  are  redeployed  as
appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurants operating staff

quality assurance

     our total  quality  department  helps ensure that all  restaurants  provide
safe  highquality  food in a clean  and  safe  environment  through  rigorous
physical  evaluation and testing at our north american  laboratories and through
point source  inspection by our international  team of quality  specialists in
several  foreign  countries  we purchase only seafood that meets or exceeds our
specifications  we use  independent  third  parties  to  inspect  and  evaluate
commodity  vendors  in addition  any commodity  supplier that produces a high
risk  product is subject to a minimum  annual food safety  evaluation by darden
personnel  we require our suppliers to maintain sound  manufacturing  practices
and operate with the comprehensive haccp food safety programs in place

     since 1976 we have  maintained a  microbiological  laboratory to routinely
test seafood and other  commodities for quality and  microbiological  safety in
addition  darden total  quality  managers and third party  auditors  visit each
restaurant  periodically  throughout  the year to review  food  handling  and to
provide education and training in food safety and sanitation  the total quality
managers  also serve as a liaison to regulatory  agencies on issues  relating to
food safety

purchasing and distribution

     our ability to ensure a consistent supply of highquality food and supplies
at competitive prices to all of our restaurant concepts depends upon procurement
from reliable  sources  our purchasing staff sources  negotiates and purchases
food and supplies from more than 2000 suppliers in 45 countries suppliers must
meet strict quality control  standards in the  development  harvest  catch and
production of food products competitive bids longterm contracts and longterm
vendor  relationships  are  routinely  used to manage  availability  and cost of
products

     we believe  that our  seafood  purchasing  capabilities  are a  significant
competitive advantage  our purchasing staff travels routinely within the united
states and  internationally  to source more than 100  varieties  of  topquality
seafood at competitive  prices  we believe that we have  established  excellent
longterm relationships with key seafood vendors and usually source our product
directly from  producers  not brokers or  middlemen  we operate a procurement
office in singapore  our only purchasing  office outside of orlando  to source
products  directly  from asia  while the supply of certain  seafood  species is
volatile  we believe that we have the ability to identify  alternative  seafood
products and to adjust our menus as necessary all other essential food products
are  available  or can be made available  upon short notice  from  alternative
qualified suppliers because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food
products inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in
relation  to  revenues   controlled   inventories  of  specified  products  are
distributed  to  all  restaurants  through  independent  national   distribution
companies

advertising and marketing

     we believe that we have  developed  significant  marketing and  advertising
capabilities  our size  enables  us to be a dominant  advertiser  in the casual
dining  segment of the  restaurant  industry  we  leverage  the  efficiency  of
national network television  advertising and supplement it with local television
advertising  our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use
advertising and product promotions to attract  customers  we implement periodic
promotions  as  appropriate  to maintain and increase our sales and profits  we
also rely on radio and  newspaper  advertising  as well as newspaper and direct
mail couponing programs as appropriate to attract customers we have developed
and consistently use sophisticated  consumer  marketing  research  techniques to
monitor customer satisfaction and evolving expectations

employees

     at the end of fiscal 2003 we employed  approximately  140700 persons  of
these  employees  approximately  1300 were  corporate  or  restaurant  concept
personnel  located  in  our  restaurant  support  center  in  orlando  florida
approximately 5850 were restaurant  management  personnel in the restaurants or
in field offices  and the remainder were hourly  restaurant  personnel  of the
restaurant support center employees approximately 60 were management personnel
and  the  balance  were  administrative  or  office  employees   our  operating
executives  have an  average  of more than 14 years of  experience  with us the
restaurant general managers average 11 years with us we believe that we provide
working  conditions and  compensation  that compare  favorably with those of our
competitors  most  employees  other than  restaurant  management and corporate
management  are paid on an hourly basis none of our employees are covered by a
collective bargaining agreement we consider our employee relations to be good

management information systems

     we strive for leadership in the restaurant  business by using technology as
a competitive  advantage  since 1975 computers located in the restaurants have
been used to assist in the management of the  restaurants  we have  implemented
systems targeted at improved financial control cost management  enhanced guest
service and improved employee effectiveness  management information systems are
designed to be used across restaurant concepts  yet are flexible enough to meet
the unique needs of each  restaurant  concept  in fiscal 2002 we implemented a
suite of webenabled  financial systems and a highspeed data network connecting
all  restaurants  to all current and  anticipated  future  applications  during
fiscal 2003 we completed an upgrade of our human  resource  including  payroll
and benefits systems using webenabled and fully integrated application suites

maintaining a disaster  recovery plan which includes storing critical  business
information offsite  testing the disaster recovery plan at a hotsite facility

systems  and  computing  technology  we  use a  strategic  information  systems
planning  process that involves  senior  management  and is integrated  into our

competition

     the restaurant  industry is intensely  competitive with respect to the type
and quality of food price service  restaurant location  personnel  concept
attractiveness  of facilities  and  effectiveness  of advertising and marketing
programs  the  restaurant  business  is often  affected  by changes in consumer
tastes  national  regional or local economic  conditions  demographic trends
traffic patterns  the type number and location of competing  restaurants  and
consumers  discretionary  purchasing  power we compete within each market with
national and regional chains as well as locallyowned restaurants  not only for
customers but also for management and hourly  personnel and suitable real estate
sites restaurants also face growing  competition from the supermarket  industry
which offers  convenient meals in the form of improved entrees and side dishes
from the deli section we expect intense competition to continue in all of these
areas

     other factors  pertaining to our  competitive  position in the industry are
addressed   under  the  sections   entitled   purchasing   and   distribution
advertising   and   marketing    management    information    systems   and

trademarks and related agreements

     we regard our  darden  restaurantsr  red  lobsterr  olive  gardenr
bahama  breezer  smokey  bonesr and seasons 52sm service  marks  and other
variations  of these service  marks  as having  significant  value and as being

our  important  service  marks  and  trademarks  and to  oppose  vigorously  any
infringement  of  them  generally   with  appropriate  renewal  and  use  the
registration of our service marks will continue indefinitely

government regulation

     we are  subject to various  federal  state and local  laws  affecting  our
business  each of our restaurants  must comply with licensing  requirements and
regulations  by a number of  governmental  authorities  which  include  health
safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is
located  the development  and operation of restaurants  depend on selecting and
acquiring suitable sites which are subject to zoning land use  environmental
traffic and other regulations  to date we have not been significantly affected
by any difficulty delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals

     presently  about 96 percent of our sales are  attributable  to the sale of
alcoholic beverages  regulations governing their sale require licensure by each
site in most  cases  on an annual  basis  and  licenses  may be  revoked  or
suspended  for cause at any time  these  regulations  relate to many aspects of
restaurant operation  including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours
of operation advertising wholesale purchasing inventory control and handling
and storage and dispensing of alcoholic  beverages  the failure of a restaurant
to obtain or retain  these  licenses  would  adversely  affect the  restaurants
operations we also are subject in certain states to dramshop statutes which
generally  provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment  that
serves alcoholic  beverages to an intoxicated  person who then causes injury to
himself or a third  party  we carry  liquor  liability  coverage as part of our
comprehensive general liability insurance

     we also are subject to federal and state  minimum  wage laws and other laws
governing  such matters as overtime  tip credits  working  conditions  safety
standards  and hiring and  employment  practices  changes in these laws during
fiscal 2003 have not had a material effect on our operations

     we currently are operating under a tip rate alternative commitment trac
agreement with the internal revenue service  through increased  educational and
other efforts in the restaurants  the trac agreement  reduces the likelihood of
potential chainwide employeronly fica assessments for unreported tips

     we are subject to federal and state  environmental  regulations  but these
rules have not had a material  effect on our  operations  during  fiscal  2003
there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities
and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated

     our  facilities  must  comply  with  the  applicable  requirements  of  the
americans with disabilities act of 1990 ada and related state  accessibility
statutes  under the ada and related  state  laws  we must  provide  equivalent
service  to  disabled  persons  and make  reasonable  accommodation  for  their
employment  and when constructing or undertaking  significant remodeling of our
restaurants we must make those facilities accessible

statements include  but are not limited to projections  regarding  our growth
plans and the number and type of new  restaurant  openings  improved  financial
performance  at bahama  breeze as a result of changing the  prototype  and other
changes at that concept  and our  expectation  to realize more of smokey bones
full  potential  as a result  of  changes  in the  location  of units  and other

uncertainties  that could  cause our actual  results to differ  materially  from
those  projected  in  forwardlooking  statements  made by us or on our behalf

     the following  factors  risks and  uncertainties  have affected  and may
continue to affect  our operating  results and the environment  within which we
conduct our  business  if our  projections  and estimates  regarding  these key
factors differ  materially from what actually  occurs  our actual results could
vary  significantly  from  the  performance  projected  in  our  forwardlooking
statements

     competition  the  casual  dining  sector  of the  restaurant  industry  is
intensely competitive in pricing  service  location  personnel  and type and
quality of food  we compete with  national  regional  and local  organizations
primarily  through the quality  variety and value perception of menu items the
number  and  location  of  restaurants   quality  and  efficiency  of  service
attractiveness  of facilities and  effectiveness  of  advertising  and marketing
programs are also important factors we anticipate that intense competition will
continue in all of these areas

     economic  market and other  conditions  certain  risks are endemic to the
restaurant and retail  industry in general  a protracted  economic  slowdown or
worsening economy  industrywide cost pressures  or weak consumer demand could
lead to  samerestaurant  sales  declines and suppress sales growth and profits
the casual  dining sector of the  restaurant  industry is affected by changes in
national  regional  and  local  economic  conditions  the  seasonality  of our
business  consumer  preferences  including  changes in consumer tastes and the
level of consumer  acceptance of

                                       12

page

our  restaurant  concepts  consumer  spending  patterns   demographic  trends
weather  traffic  patterns  and the type  number and  location  of  competing
restaurants  our ability to undertake new  restaurant  development  as well as
improvements  and  additions  to existing  restaurants  is affected by economic
conditions including interest rates and government policies impacting land and
construction costs and the cost and availability of borrowed funds

     price and  availability  of food  labor  utilities  insurance and media
other  costs  our  profitability   depends  significantly  on  our  ability  to
anticipate and react to changes in the price and  availability  of food  labor
utilities  insurance  including  workers  compensation   general  liability
health and directors and officers liability insurance advertising media and
marketing  employee  benefits  and other  costs over which we may have  little
control  the price and  availability  of  commodities  including  among other
things  shrimp lobster and other seafood are subject to fluctuation and could
increase or decrease more than we expect  we are subject to the general risk of
inflation and possible shortages or interruptions in supply caused by inclement
weather or other  conditions that could adversely  affect the  availability  and
cost of the items we buy  restaurant  preopening  expenses  could be more than
expected  and labor shortages  increased  employee turnover and higher minimum
wage rates all could  raise our cost of doing  business  our  business  also is
subject  to  the  risk  of  litigation  by  employees   consumers   suppliers
shareholders  or others  that may result in  additional  costs  there can be no
assurance  that  management  will be able to anticipate  and react to these cost
issues  without a material  adverse effect on our  profitability  and results of
operations

     unfavorable publicity relating to food safety or other concerns multiunit
restaurant  businesses  can be adversely  affected by publicity  resulting  from
complaints  or  litigation  alleging  poor  food  quality  foodborne  illness
personal injury  adverse health effects including obesity or other operational
concerns  negative  publicity may also result from actual or alleged violations
of dram shop laws that may impose  liability  on sellers of liquors when a third
party  is  injured  as a result  of  intoxication  regardless  of  whether  the
allegations are valid  unfavorable  publicity relating to just one or a limited
number of restaurants  could taint public  perception of the entire brand  such
unfavorable publicity and overall consumer perceptions of food safety could have
a material adverse effect on our business

     importance of locations  the success of our  restaurants  depends in large
part on location there can be no assurance that current locations will continue
to  be  attractive   as  demographic  patterns  change  possible  declines  in
neighborhoods where restaurants are located or economic conditions  surrounding
those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations

     government  regulation  we are subject to various federal state and local
laws affecting our business the development and operation of restaurants depend
to a  significant  extent on the selection and  acquisition  of suitable  sites
which  are  subject  to  zoning  land  use  environmental  traffic  and other
regulations  restaurant operations are also subject to licensing and regulation
by state and local departments relating to health  liquor licenses  sanitation
and safety standards federal and state labor laws including applicable minimum
wage  requirements  overtime  working and safety  conditions  and citizenship
requirements  federal and state laws which prohibit  discrimination  and other
laws  regulating the design and operation of  facilities  such as the americans
with disabilities act of 1990 we cannot predict the effect on our operations of
these laws and  regulations  or the future  enactment of additional  legislation
regulating these and other areas

     growth plans there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our
growth objectives or that new restaurants opened or acquired will be profitable
there are inherent  risks  involved with  expanding new concepts such as bahama
breeze and smokey bones that have not yet proved their longterm viability the
opening and success of  restaurants  depends on various  factors  including the
identification  and availability of suitable and economically  viable locations
sales levels at existing  restaurants  the  negotiation of acceptable  lease or
purchase terms for new locations  obtaining all required  governmental permits
including  zoning  approvals  and  liquor  licenses  on a timely  basis  other
regulatory   compliance   the   availability   of   necessary   contracts   and
subcontractors  and the ability to meet construction  schedules  our ability to
manage union activities such as picketing  which could delay construction  the
availability  of capital at affordable  cost to finance  growth  changes in the
weather  or other  acts of god that  could  result in  construction  delays  and
adversely  affect the results of one or more  restaurants  for an  indeterminate
amount of time our ability to hire and train  qualified  management  personnel
and general economic and business conditions

strategy

     the  restaurant  industry is generally  considered  to be comprised of four
segments quick service  midscale  casual dining and fine dining the industry
is highly  fragmented and includes many independent  operators and small chains
we  believe  that  capable  operators  of strong  multiunit  concepts  have the
opportunity  to increase  their share of the casual dining  segment  we plan to
grow by increasing the number of  restaurants  in each of our existing  concepts
and by  developing  or  acquiring  additional  concepts  that  can  be  expanded
profitably

     while we are a leader in the casual  dining  segment  we know we cannot be
successful  without a clear sense of who we are our core purpose is to nourish
and  delight  everyone we serve  this core  purpose is  supported  by our core
values

         o    integrity and fairness
         o    respect and caring
         o    diversity
         o    always learningalways teaching
         o    being of service
         o    teamwork and
         o    excellence

     to support our core  purpose  we have  established  a  framework  of three
strategic imperatives or building blocks

         o   leadership development as a core competency
         o   service and hospitality excellence and
         o   culinary and beverage excellence

     we support these  strategic  imperatives  by developing  two key enablers 
diversity  literacy and technology  literacy  throughout the  organization  we
believe that our continuing focus on these three building  blocks  supported by
our  commitment to diversity and  technology  provides a strong  foundation for
future growth

     our objective is to continue to expand our current  portfolio of restaurant
concepts  and to develop or acquire  additional  concepts  that can be expanded
profitably  we are  currently  testing new ideas and  concepts  and  expanding
bahama  breeze  and  smokey  bones  nationally  in light of  favorable  consumer
response we also regularly evaluate potential acquisition  candidates to assess
whether they would satisfy our strategic and financial  objectives  at present
we have not identified any specific acquisitions

     we will continue to focus on improving  operational returns at olive garden
and red lobster  and will limit new  restaurant  expansion of those concepts to
the highestpotential  sites olive gardens expansion will include its recently
developed tuscan  farmhouse  design  an outgrowth of our  collaboration  with
rocca delle macie a  familyowned  winery in tuscany  in addition  we plan to
expand  bahama  breeze  and  smokey  bones at a pace that will  enable  each new
restaurant  to capture the  concepts  full  potential  the specific  number of
openings will depend on many factors  such as our ability to locate appropriate
sites  negotiate  acceptable  purchase or lease terms  obtain  necessary local
governmental  permits  complete  construction  and recruit and train restaurant
management and hourly personnel

     we consider  location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurants
longterm  success  and we  devote  significant  effort  to the site  selection
process  prior to entering a market  we conduct a thorough  study to determine
the optimal  number and placement of  restaurants  our site  selection  process
incorporates a variety of analytical  techniques to evaluate key factors  these
factors include trade area  demographics  such as target population density and
household  income levels  competitive  influences in the trade area the sites
visibility  accessibility and traffic volume and proximity to activity centers
such as shopping malls hotelmotel complexes offices and universities members
of senior management evaluate inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to
its acquisition  constructing and opening a new restaurant  typically takes 120
to 180 days after the site is acquired and permits are obtained

2  includes all space under the roof including the coolers and freezers but
     excludes gazebos pavilions and porte cocheres
3  includes bar dining seats and patio seating but excludes bar stools
4  includes patio dining tables



     we systematically  review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that
each meets our standards  when a restaurant falls below minimum  standards  we
conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes and implement marketing and
operational plans to improve that restaurants performance  if performance does
not improve to acceptable  levels  the restaurant is evaluated for  relocation
closing or conversion to one of our other concepts

     during fiscal 2002 we permanently  closed five  rebuilt one and relocated
six red lobster restaurants in the united states and closed one red
lobster restaurant in canada during the same period we permanently closed one
and relocated one olive garden restaurant in the united states and none in
canada

restaurant operations

     we believe  that  highquality  restaurant  management  is  critical to our
longterm  success  we  also  believe  that  our  leadership  position  strong
successoriented   culture  and  various  shortterm  and  longterm   incentive
programs  including stock options and restricted stock help attract and retain
highly motivated restaurant managers

                                       5

     our restaurant  management structure varies by concept and restaurant size
each restaurant is led by a general manager and one to four additional managers
depending on the operating  complexity and sales volume of the restaurant  each
restaurant also employs  approximately 65 to 140 hourly employees  most of whom
work parttime  we issue detailed  operations  manuals  covering all aspects of
restaurant  operations  as well as food and beverage  manuals  which detail the
preparation  procedures of our formulated  recipes  the  restaurant  management
teams are  responsible  for the daytoday  operation of each restaurant and for
ensuring compliance with our operating  standards  at our two largest concepts
red lobster and olive garden  restaurant  general managers report to directors
and each director is responsible  for seven to 14  restaurants  restaurants are
visited  regularly by all levels of supervision to help ensure strict  adherence
to all aspects of our standards

     each concepts vice president or director of training together with senior
operations  executives  is  responsible  for developing  and  maintaining  that
concepts  operations  training programs  these efforts include a 12to 15week
training program for management  trainees  and continuing  development programs
for  managers  supervisors  and  directors  the  emphasis of the  training and
development  programs  varies by restaurant  concept  but includes  leadership
restaurant  business  management  and  culinary  skills  we also  use a  highly
structured  training  program  to  open  new  restaurants  including  deploying
training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations  the opening
training teams  typically begin work one week prior to opening and remain at the
new  restaurant  one  week  following  the  opening   they  are  redeployed  as
appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurants operating staff

quality assurance

     our quality assurance  department helps ensure that all restaurants provide
highquality  food in a clean and safe  environment  through rigorous  physical
evaluation  and testing at our north  american  laboratories  and through point
source  inspection in southeastern  asia we seek to purchase only seafood that
meets  or  exceeds  our  specifications   since  1976  we  have  maintained  a
microbiological  laboratory to routinely test seafood and other  commodities for
quality and  microbiological  safety in addition  quality  assurance  managers
visit each restaurant  periodically  throughout the year to review food handling
and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation the quality
assurance  managers  also serve as a liaison to  regulatory  agencies  on issues
relating to food safety  we use independent third party auditors to inspect and
evaluate  commodity  vendors  in this  manner  we attempt  to ensure  that our
suppliers   maintain   good   manufacturing   practices  and  operate  with  the
comprehensive industry standard hazard analysis critical control points programs
in place

purchasing and distribution

     our ability to ensure a consistent supply of highquality food and supplies
at competitive prices to all of our restaurant concepts depends upon procurement
from reliable  sources  our purchasing staff sources  negotiates and purchases
food and supplies from more than 2500 suppliers in 45 countries suppliers must
meet strict quality control  standards in the  development  harvest  catch and
production of food products competitive bids longterm contracts and longterm
vendor  relationships  are  routinely  used to manage  availability  and cost of
products

     we believe  that our  seafood  purchasing  capabilities  are a  significant
competitive advantage  our purchasing staff travels routinely within the united
states and  internationally  to source more than 100  varieties  of  topquality
seafood at competitive  prices  we believe that we have  established  excellent
longterm  relationships  with key seafood vendors  and source product directly
from producers not brokers or middlemen  predominantly and whenever  possible
we operate a procurement  office in singapore to source  products  directly from
asia  while the supply of certain seafood species is volatile  we believe that
we have the ability to identify  alternative  seafood products and to adjust our
menus as necessary  all other essential food products are available  or can be
made available upon short notice from alternative qualified suppliers  because
of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products inventories in the
restaurants  have a modest  aggregate  dollar  value in  relation  to  revenues
controlled  inventories of specified products are distributed to all restaurants
through national distribution companies

advertising and marketing

     we believe that we have  developed  significant  marketing and  advertising
capabilities  our size  enables  us to be a dominant  advertiser  in the casual
dining  segment of the  restaurant  industry  we  leverage  the  efficiency  of

                                       6

national  network  television  advertising  and  supplement it with local market
television advertising  our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers
and we use advertising and product promotions to attract customers we implement
periodic  promotions  as  appropriate  to maintain  and  increase  our sales and
profits we also rely on radio and newspaper  advertising  as well as newspaper
and direct mail couponing  programs  as appropriate  to attract customers  we
have developed and consistently use sophisticated  consumer  marketing  research
techniques to monitor customer satisfaction and evolving expectations

compensation  that  compare  favorably  with  those  of  our  competitors  most
employees  other than restaurant management and corporate management  are paid
on an hourly basis none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining
agreement we consider our employee relations to be good

management information systems

     we strive for leadership in the restaurant  business by using technology as
a competitive  advantage  since 1975 computers located in the restaurants have
been used to assist in the management of the  restaurants  we have  implemented
systems targeted at improved financial control cost management  enhanced guest
service and improved employee effectiveness  management information systems are
designed to be used across restaurant concepts  yet are flexible enough to meet
the unique needs of each restaurant concept  during fiscal 2002 we implemented
a  suite  of  webenabled  financial  systems  and  a  highspeed  data  network
connecting  all  restaurants  to all  current  and future  applications  we are
currently  completing an upgrade of our human  resource  including  payroll and
benefits systems using webenabled and fully integrated application suites

     restaurant  hardware and software  support is provided or coordinated  from
the restaurant support center in orlando florida seven days a week 24 hours a
day a communications  network sends and receives  critical business data to and
from  the  restaurants  throughout  the  day and  night  providing  timely  and
extensive  information on business  activity in every  location  the restaurant
support center houses our data center which contains sufficient computing power
to  process  information  from all  restaurants  quickly  and  efficiently  our
information  is  processed in a secured  environment  to protect both the actual
data  and the  physical  assets  we  guard  against  business  interruption  by
maintaining a disaster  recovery plan which includes storing critical  business
information offsite  testing the disaster recovery plan at a hotsite facility
and  providing  onsite  power  backup  via a  large  diesel  generator  we use
internally developed proprietary  software as well as purchased software  with
proven nonproprietary hardware this allows processing power to be distributed
effectively to each of our restaurants

     our  management  believes its current  systems and the  upgrades  currently
underway will position us well to support  current needs and future  growth  we
are committed to  maintaining  an industry  leadership  position in  information
systems  and  computing  technology  we  use a  strategic  information  systems
planning  process that involves  senior  management  and is integrated  into our
overall business  planning  information  systems projects are prioritized based
upon strategic financial regulatory and other business advantage criteria

competition

     the  restaurant  industry is  intensely  competitive  with  respect to food
quality  price  service  restaurant  location  concept   attractiveness  of
facilities  and  effectiveness  of  advertising  and  marketing  programs  the
restaurant  business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes  national
regional or local economic conditions demographic trends traffic patterns the
type number and location of competing restaurants and consumers discretionary
purchasing  power  we compete  within each market with  national  and  regional
chains as well as locallyowned restaurants not only for customers but also for
management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites restaurants also
face growing competition from the supermarket industry which offers convenient

meals in the form of improved entrees and side dishes from the deli section we
expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas

trademarks and related agreements

     we regard our  darden  restaurantsr  red  lobsterr  olive  gardenr
bahama  breezer and smokey  bonesr bbq sports bar service  marks  and other
variations  of these service  marks  as having  significant  value and as being
important in marketing the restaurants  our policy is to pursue registration of
our  important  service  marks and  trademarks  whenever  possible and to oppose
vigorously any infringement of them

     our only restaurant  operations outside of north america  historically have
been  conducted  through an area  development  and franchise  agreement with red
lobster  japan  co  ltd  red  lobster  japan   an  unaffiliated   japanese
corporation in december 2001 the parent company of red lobster japan agreed to
sell all the  shares  of red  lobster  japan to  another  japanese  corporation
subject to our approval  in february  2002 we entered into an amendment to the
franchise agreement to provide our approval  and to make certain  modifications
to the  terms of the  agreement  red  lobster  japan  operated  33 red  lobster
restaurants in japan as of may 26 2002 we do not have an ownership interest in
red lobster japan but receive royalty income under the franchise agreement the
amount of this income is not material to our consolidated financial statements

seasonality

     our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally  during fiscal years 2002 2001 and
2000  our sales were highest in the spring  lowest in the fall and comparable
during  winter  and  summer  holidays   severe  weather  storms  and  similar
conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions

government regulation

     we are  subject to various  federal  state and local  laws  affecting  our
business  each of our restaurants  must comply with licensing  requirements and
regulations  by a number of  governmental  authorities  which  include  health
safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is
located  the development  and operation of restaurants  depend on selecting and
acquiring suitable sites which are subject to zoning land use  environmental
traffic and other regulations  to date we have not been significantly affected
by any difficulty delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals

     presently  about nine percent of our sales are  attributable to the sale of
alcoholic beverages  regulations governing their sale require licensure by each
site in most  cases  on an annual  basis  and  licenses  may be  revoked  or
suspended  for cause at any time  these  regulations  relate to many aspects of
restaurant operation  including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours
of operation advertising wholesale purchasing inventory control and handling
and storage and dispensing of alcoholic  beverages  the failure of a restaurant
to obtain or retain  these  licenses  would  adversely  affect the  restaurants
operations we also are subject in certain states to dramshop statutes which
generally  provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment  that
wrongfully serves alcoholic  beverages to an intoxicated person who then causes
injury we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive  general
liability insurance

     we also are subject to federal and state  minimum  wage laws and other laws
governing  such matters as overtime  tip credits  working  conditions  safety
standards  and hiring and  employment  practices  changes in these laws during
fiscal 2002 have not had a material effect on our operations

     we currently are operating under a tip rate alternative commitment trac
agreement with the internal revenue service  through increased  educational and
other efforts in the restaurants  the trac agreement  reduces the likelihood of
potential chainwide employeronly fica assessments for unreported tips

conduct our  business  if our  projections  and estimates  regarding  these key
factors differ  materially from what actually  occurs  our actual results could
vary  significantly  from  the  performance  projected  in  its  forwardlooking
statements

     competition  the  casual  dining  sector  of the  restaurant  industry  is
intensely competitive in pricing  service  location  personnel  and type and
quality of food  we compete with  national  regional  and local  organizations
primarily  through the quality  variety and value perception of menu items the
number  and  location  of  restaurants   quality  and  efficiency  of  service
attractiveness  of facilities and  effectiveness  of  advertising  and marketing
programs are also important factors we anticipate that intense competition will
continue in all of these areas

     economic  market and other  conditions  the casual  dining  sector of the
restaurant  industry  is  affected by changes in  national  regional  and local
economic  conditions  the  seasonality of our business  consumer  preferences
including changes in consumer tastes and the level of consumer acceptance of our
restaurant concepts  consumer spending patterns  demographic trends  consumer
perceptions  of food  safety  that could be  negatively  impacted by  publicity
concerning  foodborne  illnesses   employee  availability   weather  traffic
patterns  and the type number and location of competing  restaurants  factors
such as inflation  food costs  labor and benefit costs  legal claims and the
availability  of  management  and  hourly   employees  also  affect   restaurant
operations and administrative  expenses our ability to undertake new restaurant
development  as well as improvements and additions to existing restaurants  is
affected  by economic  conditions  including  interest  rates  and  government
policies  impacting land and construction costs and the cost and availability of
borrowed funds

     changes in food costs and other costs  our  profitability is significantly
dependent on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the cost of food
labor  advertising and media employee benefits and similar costs over which we
have little control  the price and  availability of commodities  including but
not limited to items such as shrimp  lobster and dairy products are subject to
fluctuation  and could increase or decrease more than we expect  we are subject
to the general risk of inflation  and possible  shortages or  interruptions  in
supply caused by adverse weather or other conditions that could adversely affect
the  availability  and cost of these  and  other  items we buy  there can be no
assurance  that  management  will be able to  anticipate  and react to increased
costs without a material adverse effect on profitability

     importance of locations  the success of our  restaurants  depends in large
part on location there can be no assurance that current locations will continue
to  be  attractive   as  demographic  patterns  change  possible  declines  in
neighborhoods where restaurants are located or economic conditions  surrounding
those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations

     government  regulation  we are subject to various federal state and local
laws affecting our business the development and operation of restaurants depend
to a  significant  extent on the selection and  acquisition  of suitable  sites
which  are  subject  to  zoning  land  use  environmental  traffic  and other
regulations  restaurant operations are also subject to licensing and regulation
by state and local departments relating to health  liquor licenses  sanitation
and safety standards federal and state labor laws including applicable minimum
wage  requirements  overtime  working and safety  conditions  and citizenship
requirements  federal and state laws which prohibit  discrimination  and other
laws  regulating the design and operation of  facilities  such as the americans
with disabilities act of 1990 we cannot predict the effect on our operations of
these laws and  regulations  or the future  enactment of additional  legislation
regulating these and other areas

     growth plans there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our
growth objectives or that new restaurants opened or acquired will be profitable
the opening and success of restaurants depends on various factors including the
identification  and availability of suitable and economically  viable locations
sales levels at existing  restaurants  the  negotiation of acceptable  lease or
purchase terms for new locations  obtaining all required  governmental permits
including  zoning  approvals  and  liquor  licenses  on a timely  basis  other
regulatory   compliance   the   availability   of   necessary   contracts   and
subcontractors  and the ability to meet construction  schedules  our ability to
manage union activities such as picketing  which could delay construction  the
availability  of capital at affordable  cost to finance  growth  changes in the
weather  or other  acts of god that  could  result in  construction  delays  and
adversely  affect the results of one or more  restaurants  for an  indeterminate
amount of time our ability to hire and train  qualified  management  personnel
and general economic and business conditions

markets in the future
